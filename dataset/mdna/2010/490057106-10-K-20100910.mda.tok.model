overview kensey nash corporation is a medical device company primarily focused in the field of regenerative medicine  which is the application of devices  materials and other therapies to help repair damaged or diseased tissues 
we are recognized as a leader for innovative product development  as well as for our broad portfolio of resorbable biomaterials products 
we have an extensive range of products  which are sold through strategic partners in multiple large medical markets  including cardiology  orthopaedic  sports medicine  spinal and general surgery 
we also have an ongoing development and manufacturing program for products in the endovascular market 
we sell our products through strategic partners and do not sell direct to the end user 
our revenues consist of two components net sales  which include biomaterials sales and endovascular sales  and royalty income 
net sales biomaterials sales sales of biomaterial orthopaedic products  including products with applications primarily in the sports medicine and spinal markets  and cardiovascular products  consisting primarily of angio seal components sold to st 
jude medical  continue to be our primary source of revenue 
the table below shows the five year trend in our biomaterials sales  including orthopaedic product sales  cardiovascular product sales and general surgery product sales in thousands fiscal year ended change fy vs fy net sales of orthopaedic products cardiovascular products general surgery products other products total net sales biomaterials net sales of biomaterials products increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year primarily due to an increase in general surgery  sports medicine and cardiovascular product sales 
general surgery product sales increased due to the initial shipment of products for the launch of the xcm biologic tissue matrix products and variations in ordering patterns from another customer 
fiscal cardiovascular product sales included a one time cancellation fee of  for a research and development project 
partially offsetting the increase in sports medicine  general surgery and cardiovascular product sales was a decrease in spine product sales 
the decline in sales of spine products was due to the overall weakness in the spinal market as well as orthovita s shift in sales focus in the past year away from our co developed products 
additionally  in fiscal  spine product sales included a one time cancellation fee of  for a research and development project 

table of contents in fiscal  we expect to achieve double digit percentage growth in our sales of biomaterials products  excluding our cardiology products  as a result of the combination of new product launches of our ecm products in the us and european markets  along with the launch of our cartilage repair device in europe and overall growth in our core biomaterials business 
our net sales in the orthopaedic portion of our business are dependent on several factors  including the success of our current partners in the orthopaedic markets of sports medicine  spine and extremities  the continued acceptance of biomaterials based products in these markets  as well as expanded future acceptance of such products  competitive pricing  and our ability to offer new products and technologies and to attract new partners in these markets 
due to these dependencies  and other factors  sales to our orthopaedic customers can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
as the primary part of our cardiovascular sales  we manufacture two of the key resorbable components of the angio seal device for st 
jude medical 
specifically  we currently supply of their requirements for the collagen plug and at least of their requirements for the polymer anchors under a supply agreement that expires in december sales to st 
jude medical are highly dependent on ordering patterns of components used in the manufacturing of the angio seal device by st 
jude medical and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
in june  we entered into a new two year supply agreement with st 
jude medical effective for the period from january  to december  under the new supply agreement  we will be the exclusive outside supplier to st 
jude medical of collagen plugs  and we will not supply any polymer anchors 
the new supply agreement provides for calendar year minimum order levels equivalent to approximately of our fiscal year collagen plug sales 
as a result  if st 
jude medical s purchase levels are at the minimum levels under this new supply agreement  our related product sales in fiscal will be substantially lower than in fiscal we also have developed and manufacture products used in the general surgery markets 
these products primarily include products from our ecm program  as well as a resorbable collagen product for use in breast biopsies 
in may  we launched our new ecm product  the xcm biologic tissue matrix  in the us through our strategic partner synthes  which represents an opportunity for expansion of our growth in the general surgery market 
in june  we announced a strategic distribution agreement of our ecm products with arthrex for rotator cuff and other tendon repair procedures 
additionally  we received ce mark approval for our ecm technology in april and anticipate synthes european launch of the product in the second quarter of our fiscal royalty income we also derive a significant portion of our revenue and profitability from royalty income from proprietary products that we have developed or co developed 
angio seal tm royalty income 
we are the inventor and original developer of the angio seal device  a vascular closure device that reduces recovery time and enhances patient comfort following both diagnostic and therapeutic cardiovascular catheterizations 
st 
jude medical has the exclusive worldwide rights for the development  manufacturing and sales and marketing of the angio seal device  pursuant to an agreement that provides us with an approximate royalty on all end user product sales 
royalty income under the angio seal device license agreement is not affected by our new supply agreement with st 
jude medical 
we believe this is a mature market and anticipate that sales of the angio seal device by st 
jude medical are expected to be relatively flat in the upcoming years 
vitoss foam  vitoss  and vitoss bioactive foam royalty income 
since  we have partnered with orthovita to co develop and commercialize a series of unique and proprietary bone void filler products  branded vitoss tm foam  the first of which was launched in march  and the most recent  vitoss tm bioactive foam technology  which was launched during the fourth quarter of fiscal we receive a royalty on orthovita s end user sales of vitoss tm foam and vitoss tm bioactive foam products 
in addition  
table of contents in august  we entered into an agreement to acquire the proprietary rights of a third party inventor of the vitoss tm technology for million the assignment agreement 
under the assignment agreement  we receive an additional royalty from orthovita on the end user sales of all orthovita products containing the vitoss tm technology  up to a total royalty to be received of million  with approximately  received in fiscal and  remaining to be received as of june  we expect the royalty income under the assignment agreement to come to an end during fiscal we believe the unique technology associated with the vitoss tm foam and vitoss tm bioactive foam products  including product extensions  will result in the orthovita component of our royalty income continuing to grow over the next fiscal year 
we have other royalty generating relationships  none of which materially contributes to revenue at this time  but which we expect to provide increased revenue as the related products gain market acceptance and additional products are commercialized 
share based compensation the following table summarizes total share based compensation expense within each operating expense category of our consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years presented share based compensation fiscal year ended june  total share based compensation total share based compensation pre acceleration share based compensation acceleration of share based compensation charge total share based compensation cost of products sold research and development selling  general and administrative total share based compensation expense see acceleration of stock awards below 
share based compensation expense consists of a stock options granted to employees  non employee members of our board of directors  executive officers and non employee outside consultants  b nonvested stock awards ie  restricted stock granted to non employee members of our board of directors  an executive officer and a non employee outside consultant  and c cash settled stock appreciation rights sars granted to executive officers and other non executive employees of our company 
we cannot predict the market value of our common stock at the time of exercise for these grants  nor the magnitude of exercises at any particular time over the terms of these grants 
our cash settled sars  which are classified as liability awards  have been  and will continue to be  remeasured at each reporting period until all awards are settled 
fluctuations in the fair value of a liability award are recorded as increases or decreases in compensation cost  either immediately or over the remaining service period  depending on the vesting status of the award 
total share based compensation expense for fiscal increased in relation to the corresponding period of the prior year  primarily due to the amortized expense related to three years of equity grants versus two years of equity grants 
additionally  fiscal had higher favorable adjustments in the fair value of our cash settled sars than fiscal  which were remeasured based on  among other factors  our closing stock price on june  and see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information concerning our share based compensation 

table of contents acceleration of stock awards as we publicly announced on september   there was a change in control as defined in our fifth amended and restated kensey nash corporation employee incentive compensation plan the kensey nash corporation employee incentive compensation plan  as amended through the relevant date  the employee plan  due to the purchase in the open market by an institutional investor of more than of our shares of outstanding stock 
as a result  all then outstanding unvested stock options  stock appreciation rights and nonvested stock held by officers  employees  directors and others under the employee plan automatically became vested and  in the case of options and stock appreciation rights  exercisable in full 
the accelerated vesting resulted in a non cash charge of approximately million primarily during the quarter ended september  of fiscal the charge represented a significant portion of our operating expenses in fiscal  and  therefore  we have disclosed in the table above under share based compensation the amount related to the acceleration of share based compensation charges included within each operating expense category of our income statement for the fiscal year ended june  the acceleration removed all future equity compensation expense related to the then outstanding stock options and nonvested shares under the plan as of the date of acceleration 
however  all remaining cash settled sars  including the rights in which the vesting was accelerated  continue to be marked to market on a quarterly basis and equity compensation expense is incurred with respect to all new stock compensation awards granted after this event 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for a discussion of our purchase of a substantial majority of our sars 
the following table summarizes our share based compensation expense  by fiscal year grant  for our fiscal years ended june   and fiscal year ended june  sars stock options fiscal year grant fiscal year grant fiscal year grant fiscal year grant fiscal year grant fiscal year grant other share based compensation adjustment nonvested stock awards fiscal year grant fiscal year grant fiscal year grant fiscal year grant fiscal year grant fiscal year grant total acceleration charge of stock based awards a total share based compensation expense a see acceleration of stock awards above 
in fiscal  we expect an increase of approximately  in share based compensation expense over the million recorded in fiscal this increase is primarily a result of our fiscal stock option expense 
table of contents reflecting amortized expense related to months of equity grants  whereas fiscal amortized expense related to months of equity grants  as well as additional expense relating to unfavorable mark to market adjustments on cash settled sars 
our share based compensation expense is derived using the black scholes option pricing valuation model  which is dependent on several factors  such as weighted average assumptions  stock volatilities  employee termination behavior and other factors that differ each fiscal year 
the expense may vary significantly if there is a change in any one of these valuation assumptions 
cost reduction plan in the second quarter of fiscal  we implemented a cost reduction plan  primarily associated with our reduced endovascular activities and lower production volume 
this cost reduction plan was comprised of headcount reductions  primarily through a voluntary retirement program  as well as reduced work schedules 
in connection with this plan  we incurred million in pre tax charges in our second quarter of fiscal consisting of a million pre tax severance charge and a  pre tax unabsorbed overhead expense charge 
the following table summarizes the cost reduction plan pre tax charges within each operating expense category of our consolidated statements of income for fiscal fiscal year ended june  severance charge unabsorbed overhead expense charge total cost reduction plan charges cost of products sold research and development selling  general and administrative total cost reduction plan charges property insurance claim in fiscal  a fire occurred which was contained to a small manufacturing area within the company s corporate headquarters building 
the company s property insurance policy covered all remediation efforts and fixed asset replacements  subject to a  deductible 
we recognized a gain of  within cost of products sold upon final settlement with the insurance carrier as remediation and recovery efforts were completed 
we received million in total insurance proceeds for remediation efforts  replacement value of fixed assets and other expenses 
we have replaced damaged fixed assets with a total value of approximately  the remaining insurance proceeds were used by the company to pay for other related expenses and added to general company funds 
the total insurance proceeds  including amounts relating to the outside remediation services and fixed assets  have been classified within the investing activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows  and the balance of the insurance proceeds  used by the company to pay for other related expenses  has been classified within the operating activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies revenue recognition  accounting for share based compensation  accounting for investments in debt and equity securities  valuation of financial instruments  inventory valuation and income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with fasb asc topic  revenue recognition asc s 
we also follow fasb asc subtopic  multiple element arrangements asc 
table of contents for customer arrangements containing multiple revenue elements that were entered into  or materially amended  after june  sales revenue 
sales revenue is generally recognized when the related product is shipped or the service is completed 
advance payments received for products or services are generally recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized when the product is shipped or services are performed  the timing of the performance of such services could be subjective 
we reduce sales for estimated customer returns and other allowances  if applicable 
our products are primarily manufactured according to our customers specifications and are subject to return only for failure to meet those specifications 
royalty revenue 
royalty revenue is recognized as the related product is sold by our customers to end users 
we recognize substantially all of our royalty revenue at the end of each month  in accordance with our customer agreements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information concerning our royalty revenue recognition 
accounting for share based compensation 
we use various forms of equity compensation  including stock options  nonvested stock awards and cash settled sars  as a major part of our compensation programs to retain and provide incentives to our top management team members and other employees 
we account for equity compensation in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
revisions to any of our estimates or methodologies could have a material impact to our financial statements 
fair value of option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which uses weighted average assumptions 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our common stock and other factors 
we use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model 
we separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior and consider them separately for valuation purposes 
the expected term of options is derived from historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on us treasuries with constant maturities in effect at the time of grant 
nonvested stock awards ie restricted stock granted to non employee members of our board of directors  executive officers and a non employee consultant are accounted for using the fair value method 
fair value for nonvested stock awards is based upon the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant 
cash settled sars awarded in share based payment transactions are classified as liability awards  accordingly  we record these awards as a component of other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of each sar is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  which uses weighted average assumptions 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock  as well as other factors 
for liability awards  the fair value of the award  which determines the measurement of the liability on our consolidated balance sheet  is remeasured at each reporting period until the award is settled 
fluctuations in the fair value of the liability award are recorded as increases or decreases in compensation cost  either immediately or over the remaining service period  depending on the vested status of the award 
we use historical data to estimate employee termination within the valuation model  employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
the expected term of cash settled sars has been determined using the simplified method in accordance with asc s accounting for investments in debt securities 
we account for our investment portfolio in accordance with fasb asc topic  investments debt and equity securities 
we have classified our entire investment portfolio as available for sale securities with secondary or resale markets and report the portfolio at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders equity and realized gains and losses in other income 
we currently have various investment securities with fair values that are less than their amortized costs and  therefore  contain unrealized losses 
the unrealized losses related to these investments were due to either changes in interest rates or investments obtained at a premium 
we have evaluated these securities and have determined 
table of contents that the decline in value is not related to any company or industry specific event 
we have no intent to sell any of these investments until there is a recovery of the fair value  and there is no current requirement that we sell any of these investments 
we anticipate full recovery of amortized costs with respect to these securities at maturity or sooner in the event of a more favorable market interest rate environment 
revisions to our classification of these investments  and or a determination other than the anticipation of a full recovery of the amortized costs at maturity or sooner  could result in our realizing gains and losses on these investments and  therefore  have a material impact on our financial statements 
valuation of financial instruments 
we adopted the provisions of fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  asc for financial assets and liabilities  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure financial assets and liabilities by defining fair value as the exit price  or the amount that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date 
categorization is based on a three tier valuation hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
inventory valuation 
our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
adjustments to inventory are made at the individual part level for estimated excess  obsolescence or impaired balances  to reflect inventory at the lower of cost or market 
factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand  technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  physical deterioration and quality concerns 
revisions to these adjustments would be required if any of these factors differ from our estimates 
income taxes 
in the course of estimating our estimated annual effective tax rate and recording our quarterly income tax provisions  we consider many factors  including our expected earnings  state income tax apportionment  estimated manufacturing and research and development tax credits  non taxable interest income and other estimates 
material changes in  or differences from  these estimates  including the extension of the research and development tax credit  could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years and total revenues 
total revenues of million in fiscal decreased from total revenues of million in fiscal total net sales 
net sales of products decreased to million for fiscal  compared to net sales of million for fiscal we had a million  or  increase in our biomaterials sales and a million  or  decrease in our endovascular sales 
biomaterials sales 
biomaterials sales were million in fiscal  a increase compared to million in fiscal biomaterials sales include revenue recognized from products shipped  as well as revenue generated from product development programs with  and milestone revenue earned from  biomaterials customers 
the biomaterials sales increase was primarily due to our cardiovascular and general surgery product lines 
cardiovascular product sales  primarily consisting of sales of angio seal components to st 
jude medical  of million in fiscal increased million  or  from million in fiscal due to favorable variations in ordering patterns of components used in the manufacture of the angio seal device by st 
jude medical 
cardiovascular product sales in fiscal included a cancellation fee charged to a customer of approximately  for cardiovascular product related research and development work we performed 
also contributing to the increase in biomaterials sales 
table of contents was our continued growth in general surgery product sales  which were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from million in fiscal this increase was due to initial shipments to synthes related to the us launch of our new ecm product  the xcm biologic tissue matrix  as well as due to the timing of increased orders of collagen product sales to a customer for use in breast biopsies 
these increases in product sales were offset in part by a decrease in orthopaedic product sales 
orthopaedic product sales  consisting primarily of sports medicine and spine products  were million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or  from million in fiscal sales of spine products decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline in sales of spine products was due to the overall weakness in the spinal market  as well as orthovita s shift in sales focus in the past year away from our co developed products 
additionally  in fiscal  spine product sales included a one time cancellation fee of  charged to a customer for research and development work performed 
this decrease in spine products was offset by an increase in our sports medicine product sales of  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was due primarily to favorable variations in ordering patterns 
endovascular sales 
endovascular sales were million in fiscal  a decrease compared to sales of million in fiscal endovascular sales include revenue recognized from products shipped to  as well as milestone revenue recognized from product development programs with  spectranetics 
the endovascular sales decrease was primarily due to a decrease in safe cross and quickcat product sales 
our second quarter of fiscal ended december  was the last quarter reflecting our sales of the quickcat device  as the quickcat manufacturing was transferred to spectranetics as of december further  spectranetics publicly announced the discontinuation of sales of the safe cross product line in the second quarter of fiscal in fiscal  we recognized revenue of  as compared to  in fiscal for two milestones achieved in that year under our development and regulatory service agreement with spectranetics 
royalty income 
royalty income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal royalty income of million from st 
jude medical s angio seal net end user sales in fiscal decreased from million in fiscal  primarily due to fewer shipping days in fiscal compared to fiscal  in combination with product mix changes and the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in fiscal end user sales of the angio seal device decreased in fiscal over the prior fiscal year 
royalty income of million from orthovita s vitoss  vitoss foam and vitoss bioactive foam products net end user sales in fiscal were consistent with fiscal end user sales of our co developed vitoss foam and vitoss bioactive foam products increased in fiscal from the prior fiscal year 
cost of products sold 
fiscal year ended fiscal year ended change prior period to current period cost of products sold gross margin on net sales 
table of contents cost of products sold was million in fiscal  a  or  decrease from million in fiscal gross margin on net sales was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in cost of products sold was a result of our recognition of  in net gain from property insurance proceeds for a claim under our property insurance policy  as well as  a  reduction in expense for a provision to upgrade the safe cross product that was no longer necessary due to the cancellation of the safe cross product line by spectranetics 
further contributing to the reduction of cost of products sold was the million decrease in net sales  excluding net milestone revenue recognized of million in fiscal and  in fiscal offsetting these decreases within cost of products sold for fiscal  as a result of the fiscal second quarter cost reduction plan  was  in unabsorbed overhead charges due to reduced work schedules during the quarter and  in severance charges 
we believe gross margin on net sales for fiscal will decrease slightly as compared to fiscal due to product mix changes  primarily relating to introduction of new product lines and the expected reduction of sales of angio seal components 
research and development expense 
fiscal year ended fiscal year ended change prior period to current period research development research development as a of revenue research and development expense was million in fiscal  a  or  decrease from million in fiscal the decrease in research and development expense was due to a  decrease in animal studies and outside services costs  a  decrease in design  development and supply expenses  a  decrease in engineering consulting costs and  decrease in expenses due to a charge incurred in the prior fiscal year in connection with a customer cancellation of research and development projects 
offsetting these decreases within research and development expense for fiscal  as a result of the previously disclosed fiscal second quarter cost reduction plan  was  in severance charges that increased research and development expense 
additionally  there was an increase in personnel costs  including salaries and equity compensation expense  of  research and development expense was of our revenue in both fiscal and fiscal we believe research and development expense in fiscal will increase as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of our plans to increase our clinical activities in our cartilage and ecm technologies both in the us and in europe 
we recently received fda approval to initiate our us pilot trial for our cartilage repair device  and we expect to begin this trial in the first half of fiscal clinical efforts in pursuit of fda approval and continuing development of the cartilage repair device application  as well as our continued development of proprietary biomaterials products and technologies  require significant research and development expenditures 
we cannot make any assurances as to the successful completion of these studies or subsequent regulatory approval for the cartilage repair product application or for future applications in the us or internationally 
selling  general and administrative expense 
fiscal year ended fiscal year ended change prior period to current period selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative as a of revenue 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expense was million in fiscal  a  or  decrease from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense decreased from the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of reduced professional fees of  partially offset by  in severance charges  as a result of the previously disclosed fiscal second quarter cost reduction plan 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of our revenue for each of the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
we believe selling  general and administrative expenditures in total as a percentage of revenue will remain consistent in fiscal with fiscal interest income interest expense 
interest income decreased by to  in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was due to significant decreases in interest rates earned on our average cash and investment balances during the fiscal year ended june  over the prior fiscal year 
interest expense on our mortgage during fiscal was essentially flat at million compared to the prior year 
we have borrowed million under the mortgage with citibank  fsb  which the outstanding principal balance was million as of june  the mortgage is hedged by a fixed interest rate swap bearing interest of 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information concerning the mortgage and the swap 
other income loss 
other non operating loss was  in fiscal  a decrease of  from non operating income of  in fiscal other non operating loss in fiscal primarily represents non operating items  including loss on foreign currency exchange 
other non operating income for fiscal primarily represents non operating items  including the  of deferred revenue recognized as a component of other income  as a result of the august final settlement of outstanding items related to our opportunity grant program of the department of community and economic development of the commonwealth of pennsylvania governor s action team and net gain loss on foreign currency exchange 
there was no remaining deferred revenue from the opportunity grant program as of june  income tax expense 
our tax expense in fiscal was million  resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 
we could only claim research and development tax credits through december  as a component of our tax provision related to our ongoing performance of qualified research and development under the previously approved october congressional extension of the research experimentation r e tax credit 
our fiscal effective tax rate of included a retroactive adjustment to our tax provision during our second fiscal quarter ended december  as a result of the october extension of the r e tax credit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information concerning our effective tax rate 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years and total revenues 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal total net sales 
net sales of products increased to million for fiscal compared to net sales of million for fiscal we had a million  or  increase in our biomaterials sales  offset by a million  or  decrease in our endovascular sales 
biomaterials sales 
biomaterials sales were million in fiscal  a increase compared to million in fiscal biomaterials sales includes revenue recognized from products shipped as well as revenue generated from product development programs with biomaterials customers 
the increase in biomaterials sales was primarily the result of strong sales in both the cardiovascular and orthopaedic product lines 
cardiovascular product sales  primarily consisting of sales of angio seal components to st 
jude medical  were million in fiscal  a increase compared to 
table of contents million in fiscal fiscal cardiovascular revenue included a cancellation fee charged to a customer of approximately  for cardiovascular product related research and development work we performed 
orthopaedic sales were million in fiscal  a increase compared to million in fiscal the orthopaedic product sales increase was primarily the result of an increase in spine products sales by to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the increase in sales of spine products was primarily attributable to strong sales of current and new product lines to orthovita  and cancellation fees charged to a customer for research and development work performed  offset  in part by weaker sales of our bone void filler products based on customer inventory levels and what we believe to be increased competition in this market 
sports medicine product sales of million decreased by from million in fiscal sports medicine product sales in fiscal were positively impacted due to new product launches and stronger sales of existing products  but were offset by exceptionally high orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal from two major customers and current economic conditions  which negatively impacted customer inventory levels 
endovascular sales 
endovascular sales were million in fiscal  a decrease compared to sales of million in fiscal endovascular sales include revenue recognized from products shipped  as well as milestone revenue recognized from product development programs with spectranetics 
during fiscal  endovascular product sales to spectranetics were at a reduced transfer price compared to the direct to market price reflected in our prior sales figures 
the decrease in endovascular sales in fiscal from fiscal was a direct result of this reduced transfer price  as overall net unit sales to spectranetics increased as compared to fiscal end user unit sales 
during fiscal  we announced the accomplishment of two milestones under our development and regulatory service agreement with spectranetics  which resulted in million of cash payments and our recognition of  in revenue 
royalty income 
royalty income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal angio seal royalty income from st 
jude medical end user sales of million decreased compared to million in fiscal we estimate that angio seal royalties for fiscal were negatively impacted due to foreign currency exchange by approximately  compared to fiscal despite the negative impact of foreign currency exchange  st 
jude medical s end user sales of the angio seal device  which included the negative impact of foreign currency exchange  only declined by in fiscal from the prior fiscal year 
royalty income from net end user sales of orthovita s vitoss  vitoss foam and vitoss bioactive foam products in fiscal of million increased compared to million in fiscal end user sales of our co developed vitoss foam and vitoss bioactive foam products increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the successful introduction of the new vitoss bioactive foam products  as well as continued sales of existing vitoss foam products by orthovita in the end user marketplace  contributed to the increase in royalty income

gross margin on net sales in fiscal was compared to gross margin on net sales of in fiscal the increase in gross margin in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year was due in part to product mix  as well as higher volumes  process improvements and revenue generated from product development programs with biomaterials customers and the decrease in costs of products sold discussed above 
the gross margin in the same period of the prior fiscal year was negatively affected by start up costs associated with the safe cross product line  as we initiated and continued to refine the manufacturing process on this new product line 
also negatively impacting the gross margin in the prior fiscal year by approximately were the charges related to the sale of our endovascular division  the acceleration of share based awards and the discontinuance of the embolic protection platform 
research and development expense 
fiscal year ended fiscal year ended change prior period to current period research development research development as a of revenue research and development expense was million in fiscal  a  or  increase from million in fiscal the increase in research and development expense for the period over the prior fiscal year was due to i a million increase in our biomaterials research and development expenses primarily due to design and development expenses related to the commencement of  and increased focus in  our articular cartilage regeneration matrix and ecm projects and expenses incurred in connection with a customer cancellation of research and development projects and ii a  increase in our personnel costs  primarily related to an increase in share based equity compensation costs 
these increases are offset by an  charge incurred for the acceleration of share based awards in the prior fiscal year  which was not applicable to fiscal during fiscal  we furthered our cartilage preclinical studies in preparation for a us clinical trial and  in february  filed an ide submission for a cartilage us clinical trial

general we plan to continue to increase our research and development activities for our biomaterials products and continue our endovascular product research and development activities based on our development contract with spectranetics 
we believe our current cash and investment balances and expected future cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating  financing and capital requirements for the next months 
although we believe our cash and investment balances will also be sufficient on a longer term basis  that will depend on numerous factors  including the following continuation of our existing customer relationships and royalty streams  market

see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments  as well as the fair value of our investments and the swap 
investment portfolio our investment portfolio consists of highly rated us government agency bonds and municipal bonds issued by states  cities  counties and other governmental entities 
the majority of these investments have maturities ranging from less than one year to approximately three years 
we mitigate default risk by investing in what we believe are safe and high credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
our portfolio includes only securities with secondary or resale markets 
we have an audit committee approved investment 
table of contents strategy  which currently limits the duration and types of our investments relative to diversification and maturities to maintain safety and liquidity 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and decreases in market value if interest rates increase 
as of june   our total investment portfolio consisted of approximately million of investments 
while our investments generally may be sold at any time because the portfolio includes available for sale securities with secondary or resale markets  we generally hold securities until the earlier of their call date or their maturity 
we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates 
we review our investments to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible impairment 
we have not experienced any liquidity or impairment issues with our investments 
however  due to recent economic conditions  bond issuers financial condition and the credit markets have continued to be highly volatile  and there can be no assurance that these conditions will not in the future adversely affect the liquidity or value of our investments in government agency bonds or municipal bonds 
if these challenging economic conditions continue  or any investments in our portfolio experience any additional ratings downgrades  we may incur impairments to our investment portfolio  which could negatively affect our financial condition  cash flows and results of operation 
we have no intent to sell any of these investments until a recovery of their respective fair values  which may be at maturity  and we have no current requirement to sell any of these investments 
additional information regarding our investments is located in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein in this form k 
debt on may   we entered into a million aggregate ten year fixed interest rate swap  with citibank  na  to manage the market risk from changes in interest rates under the mortgage 
as of june   the outstanding principal under the mortgage was million see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
our objective and strategy for undertaking the swap was to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows and interest expense associated with the future interest rate payments under the mortgage and to reduce our interest rate risk in the event of an unfavorable interest rate environment 
we currently utilize the hypothetical derivative method in determining the hedge effectiveness of the hedged item each period 
we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates 
if the conditions underlying the swap or the hedge item change  there is a risk that our hedged item would be deemed an ineffective hedge  and therefore  we would record changes in the fair value of the swap within our consolidated statements of income  as well as our consolidated statements of cash flows 
additional information regarding the swap is located in note under the heading interest rate swap agreement to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company s business is not directly dependent on foreign operations  as the company s sales to customers outside the us are not significant 
however  a portion of the company s total revenues  including sales and royalties  are dependent on us based customers selling to end users outside the us there is a risk related to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates as it relates to our royalties paid to us in us dollars for which royalties are received on end user sales within foreign countries 
we are currently not taking any affirmative steps to hedge the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not expect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows to be materially impacted due to a sudden change in foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations relative to the us dollar
