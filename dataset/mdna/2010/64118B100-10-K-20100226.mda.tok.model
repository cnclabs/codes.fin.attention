item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading fabless semiconductor company that designs  develops and sells proprietary high performance processors and high speed integrated circuits that are used to enhance the performance and functionality of advanced g g mobile wireless infrastructure  data center  enterprise  metro ethernet  edge and core infrastructure networks 
our market leading product portfolio includes high performance multi core processors  knowledge based processors  high speed gigabit ethernet physical layer devices  network search engines  and ultra low power embedded processors 
these products are designed into high performance systems such as switches  routers  wireless base stations  radio network controllers  security appliances  networked storage appliances  service gateways and connected media devices offered by leading original equipment manufacturers oems such as alaxala networks corporation  alcatel lucent  arris group  inc  brocade communications systems  inc  cisco systems  inc  dell inc  ericsson  fortinet  inc  fujitsu limited  hangzhou hc technologies co 
ltd  hitachi  ltd  huawei technologies co  ltd  huawei symantec technologies co  ltd  ibm corporation  juniper networks  inc  lg electronics  inc  motorola  inc  nec corporation  samsung electronics  sun microsystems  inc  tellabs  and zte corporation 
the products and technologies we have developed and acquired are targeted to enable our customers to develop systems that support the increasing speeds and complexity of the internet infrastructure 
we believe there is a growing need to include multi core processors  knowledge based processors  and high speed physical layer devices in a larger number of such systems as networks transition to all internet protocol ip packet processing at increasing speeds and complexity 
the equipment and systems that use our products are technically complex 
as a result  the time from our initial customer engagement design activity to volume production can be lengthy and may require considerable support from our design engineering  research and development  sales  and marketing personnel in order to secure the engagement and commence product sales to the customer 
once the customer s equipment is in volume production  however  it generally has a life cycle of three to five years and requires less ongoing support 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of semiconductor products to oems  their contract manufacturers and distributors 
usually  we sell the initial shipments of a product for a new design engagement directly to the oem customer 
once the design enters volume production  the oem frequently outsources its manufacturing to contract manufacturers who purchase the products directly from us 
we also use distributors to provide valuable assistance to end users in delivery of our products and related services 
in accordance with standard market practice  our distributor agreements limit the distributor s ability to return product up to a portion of purchases in the preceding quarter and limit price protection for inventory on hand if it subsequently lowers prices on our products 
we recognize sales through distributors at the time of shipment to end customers 
as a fabless semiconductor company  our business is less capital intensive than others because we rely on third parties to manufacture  assemble  and test our products 
in general  we do not anticipate making significant capital expenditures aside from business acquisitions that we might make from time to time 
in the future  as we launch new products or expand our operations  however  we may require additional funds to procure product mask sets  order elevated quantities of wafers from our foundry partners  perform qualification testing and assemble and test those products 
because we purchase all wafers from suppliers with fabrication facilities and outsource the assembly and testing to third party vendors  a significant portion of our costs of revenue consists of payments to third party vendors 

table of contents recent acquisitions on october   we completed the acquisition of rmi  a provider of high performance and low power multi core  multi threaded processors 
pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger reorganization by and among us  roadster merger corporation  rmi corporation and wp viii representative llc dated as of may   or the merger agreement  on october   roadster merger corporation was merged with and into rmi  and we delivered merger consideration of approximately million shares of our common stock and million cash to the paying agent for distribution to the holders of rmi capital stock 
approximately of the shares of our common stock are being held in escrow as security for claims and expenses that might arise during the first months following the closing date 
the closing price of a share of our common stock on october  was 
we may be required to issue and deliver up to an additional million shares of common stock and pay an additional million cash to the former holders of rmi capital stock as earn out consideration based upon achieving specified percentages of revenue targets for either the month period from october  through september   or the month period from november  through october   whichever period results in the higher percentage of the revenue target 
the additional earn out consideration  if any  net of applicable indemnity claims  will be paid on or before december  on july   we completed the idt nse acquisition 
the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination during the third quarter of fiscal as purchase consideration we paid million in cash  net of a price adjustment based on a determination of the actual amount of inventory received 
on october   we completed the merger and acquisition of aeluros  inc which we refer to as the aeluros acquisition 
the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination during the fourth quarter of fiscal we paid million in cash upon the closing of the transaction in exchange for all of the outstanding equity securities of aeluros 
we reserved  shares of common stock for future issuance upon the exercise of unvested employee stock options of aeluros that we assumed and are subject to continued employment vesting requirements 
in addition  under the terms of the definitive agreement  we paid million cash in february based on the attainment of revenue performance milestones for the acquired business during the one year period following the close of the transaction 
our results of operations for reflect two months of revenues subsequent to the rmi acquisition and five and one half months of revenue subsequent to the idt nse acquisition 
revenues in the second half of  included million attributable to the idt nse acquisition and million of revenue attributable to the rmi acquisition 
the last quarter of also included operating costs associated with an additional employees from the rmi acquisition 
results of operations in will reflect a full year of revenues and costs attributable to both acquisitions and consequently will be substantially higher than comparable period results in 
table of contents outlook and challenges our year over year revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  in early  in light of a volatile macro economic environment and a decrease in demand  we focused on operating efficiencies and containing our cash operating expense growth during the second half of we experienced an increase in sequential quarterly revenue growth 
our quarterly revenues grew from million in the second quarter of to million in the third quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of the sequential increase in our quarterly revenues was due to a combination of an improvement in the macroeconomic environment as well as increased demand for our products as result of new customer programs being introduced into the market utilizing our products and new revenues from our acquisitions 
given the resumption of our revenue growth  for we have shifted from focusing on containing our cash operating expenses to strategically investing in our product development and scaling our business operations to support our growth as well as the continued succesful integration of the idt nse business and rmi 
our continued integration efforts include  the assimilation of employees  retaining key personnel  process and system rationalization related to our management information and enterprise resource planning systems to keep in pace with our breadth and scale of business  while maintaining regulatory compliance  and keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers 
for the years ended december    and  our top five customers in terms of revenue accounted for approximately   and of total product revenue  respectively 
although we believe our revenues will continue to be concentrated with our significant customers  we expect continued favorable market trends  such as the increasing number of gigabit ports as enterprises and datacenters upgrade their legacy networks to better accommodate the proliferation of video and virtualization applications  and the growing mobile wireless infrastructure and iptv markets  will enable us to broaden our customer base 
additionally  our expanding product portfolio will also help us further diversify our customer and product revenues as well as expanding our product portfolio with our existing customers 
cisco business cisco and its contract manufacturers have accounted for a large percentage of our historical revenue 
at cisco s request  in  we transitioned into a just in time inventory arrangement covering substantially all of our product shipments to cisco and its contract manufacturers 
pursuant to this arrangement we deliver products to wintec industries wintec based on orders they place with us  but we do not recognize product revenue unless and until wintec reports that it has delivered the product to cisco or its contract manufacturer to incorporate into its end products 
given this arrangement  unless cisco or its contract manufacturers take possession of our products from wintec in accordance with the schedules provided to us  our predicted future revenue stream could vary substantially from our forecasts  and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  because we own the inventory physically located at wintec until it is shipped to cisco and its contract manufacturers  our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired  causing our total inventory levels to increase 
this  in turn  could increase our expenses associated with excess and obsolete product and negatively impact our cash flows 
for the years ended december   and  our revenues from cisco and cisco s contract manufactures were million  million and million or approximately   and of total revenue 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make fair and reasonable estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities and operating expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period they are determined to be necessary 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates  our financial statements could be materially impacted 
our estimates are guided by observing the following critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from sales of semiconductor products 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria have been met i persuasive evidence of a binding arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and iv collection is probable 
the price is considered fixed or determinable at the execution of an agreement  based on specific products and quantities to be delivered at specified prices  which is often memorialized with a customer purchase order 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness and any past transaction history of the customer 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of revenue 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment to oem customers  their contract manufacturers and our international sales representatives 
revenue consists primarily of sales of the company s products to oems  their contract manufacturers or distributors 
initial sales of the company s products for a new design are usually made directly to oems as they design and develop their product 
once their design enters production  they often outsource their manufacturing to contract manufacturers that purchase the company s products directly from the company or from the company s distributors product revenue and costs relating to sales made through distributors with rights of return and price credits are deferred until the distributors sell the product to end customers because the selling price is not fixed and determinable and we are not able to estimate future returns 
revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor that product has been sold to an end customers 
on each reporting date the company records a reduction in accounts receivable and deferred revenue based on the company s estimate of the margin to be ultimately recognized upon sale of the product to an end customer we entered into a purchase agreement with wintec who has become the primary purchaser of our products on a consignment basis for resale to cisco and its contract manufacturers 
we generally recognize revenue when wintec ships our product to cisco or its contract manufacturers 
inventory valuation and adverse purchase commitments 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
these estimates are generally based on a month forecast prepared by management 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those expected by management  additional adjustment to inventory valuation may be required 
the carrying value of inventory and the determination of possible adverse purchase commitments are dependent on our estimate of the yield that will be achieved  or the percent of good products identified when the product is tested 
warranty accrual 
our products are subject to warranty for a period ranging from one to five years from the date of sale and we provide for the estimated future costs of replacement upon shipment of the product in the accompanying statements of operations 
we estimate our warranty accrual based on historical claims compared to historical revenue and assume that we will have to replace products subject to a claim 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
in order to determine the collectability of our accounts receivable  we continually assess factors such as previous customer transactions and the credit worthiness of the customer 
to date  our accounts receivable write offs have been immaterial 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make required payments 
in general  we establish such allowances for accounts aged over days from the invoice date  unless specific circumstances indicate that the balance is collectible 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  income taxes 
in applying asc  we are required to estimate our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
during the third fiscal quarter of  we reassessed the valuation allowance previously recorded against our net deferred tax assets which consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits 
based on our earnings history and projected future taxable income  management determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted asc income taxes 
as a result  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed in the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
refer to note income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further information 
long lived assets and intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we estimate the future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset from its use or eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows  which includes revenue  is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flow 
we perform goodwill impairment test for our single and sole reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired 
we perform the goodwill impairment assessment at the company level  which is the sole reporting unit 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended december   and stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes merton valuation model the black scholes model  consistent with the provisions of asc compensation stock compensation 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life  the price volatility of the underlying stock and future forfeitures and related tax effects 
the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using a combination of the historical and implied volatility of the company s common stock 
changes in the subjective assumptions required in the valuation models may significantly affect the estimated value of the awards  the related stock based compensation expense and  consequently  our results of operations

of the estimated acquisition related contingent consideration liability recorded as of december  of million  approximately million would be payable in cash and million payable in stock 
although in recent years we have generated sufficient net cash from operations to meet our capital requirements  we will be substantially larger with greater operating cash needs as a result of the acquisitions of idt nse and rmi 
our future cash needs will depend on many factors  including the amount of revenue we generate  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  and the continuing market acceptance of our products  and any future business acquisitions that we might undertake 
we may seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing  and have a shelf registration allowing us to sell up to approximately million of our securities from time to time during the next three years 
however  additional funding could be constrained by the terms and covenants under our senior secured credit facility and may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we also might decide to raise additional capital at such times and upon such terms as management considers favorable and in our interests  including  but not limited to  from the sale of our debt and or equity securities before reductions for expenses  underwriting discounts and commissions under our shelf registration statement  but we cannot be certain that we will be able to complete offerings of our securities at such times and on such terms as we may consider desirable for us 
contractual obligations our principal commitments as of december  are summarized below in thousands total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations software license obligations wafer purchases acquisiton related contingent consideration total in addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations quantified in the table above  we have other obligations for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business 
these obligations  however  either are not enforceable or legally binding or are subject to change based on our business decisions 
in addition  due to uncertainty with respect to timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note income taxes or a discussion on income taxes 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in sec regulations 

table of contents indemnities  commitments and guarantees in the normal course of business  we have made certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include agreements to indemnify our customers with respect to liabilities associated with the infringement of other parties technology based upon our products  obligations to indemnify our lessors under facility lease agreements  and obligations to indemnify our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of delaware 
the duration of such indemnification obligations  commitments and guarantees varies and  in certain cases  is indefinite 
we have not recorded any liability for any such indemnification obligations  commitments and guarantees in the accompanying balance sheets 
we do  however  accrue for losses for any known contingent liability  including those that may arise from indemnification provisions  when future payment is estimable and probable 
under master purchase agreements signed with cisco in november  we have agreed to indemnify cisco for costs incurred in rectifying epidemic failures  up to the greater of on a per claim basis of all amounts paid to us by cisco during the preceding months approximately  million at december  or million  plus replacement costs 
if we are required to make payments under the indemnity  our operating results may be adversely affected 
significant accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued update no 
or asu  which updates the guidance currently included under topic asc  multiple element arrangements 
asu relates to the final consensus reached by fasb on a new revenue recognition guidance regarding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the new accounting guidance addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting  and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
the new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and may be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements 
in addition  early adoption is permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements 
effective july   we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  generally accepted accounting principles overall asc 
asc establishes the fasb accounting standards codification the codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative us gaap for sec registrants 
all guidance contained in the codification carries an equal level of authority 
the codification superseded all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification is non authoritative 
the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts 
instead  it will issue accounting standards updates asus 
the fasb will not consider asus as authoritative in their own right 
asus will serve only to update the codification  provide background information about the guidance and provide the bases for conclusions on the change s in the codification 
references made to fasb guidance throughout this document have been updated for the codification 
effective april   we adopted fasb asc  subsequent events overall asc 
asc establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
it requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date that is  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
this disclosure should alert all users of financial statements that an entity has not evaluated subsequent events after that date in the set of financial statements being presented 
adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
effective january   we adopted the fasb asc  business combinations asc 
asc updated guidance related to business combinations 
the updated guidance establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
the updated standard also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the updated standard also provides guidance for recognizing changes in an acquirer s existing income tax valuation allowances and tax uncertainty accruals that result from a business combination transaction as adjustments to income tax expense 
the updated guidance had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the year ended december  in fiscal  we completed the idt nse and rmi acquisitions 
under the updated guidance we expensed the transaction costs associated with the idt nse and rmi acquisitions  while under the prior accounting standards such costs would have been capitalized 
in addition  we recognized the fair value of a contingent earn out liability in connection with the rmi acquisition of million  and subsequently recognized an expense of million related to the change in the estimated fair value of contingent earn out liability  while under the prior accounting standards the earn out would not have been recognized as part of the consideration transferred until the contingency was resolved 
further  we acquired in process research and development of million in connection with the rmi acquisition which has been capitalized in accordance with the updated guidance  whereas under prior authoritative guidance the amount would have been expensed immediately 
therefore  the adoption of the updated guidance related to business combinations has had and likely will continue to have a material impact on our future consolidated financial statements
