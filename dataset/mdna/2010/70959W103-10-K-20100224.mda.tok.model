item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents long term business strategy we believe offering our customers superior customer service in a premium location fosters a long term relationship  which helps generate repeat and referral business  particularly in our higher margin service and parts business 
we believe our focus on developing a loyal customer base has helped generate incremental vehicle and service and parts sales 
in addition  our large number of dealerships  geographically concentrated by region  allows us the opportunity to achieve cost savings and implement best practices 
in addition  although we have reduced acquisition and facility investment in response to recent economic conditions  we remain committed to our long term strategy to sell and service outstanding vehicle brands in premium facilities 
offer outstanding brands in premium facilities we have the highest percentage of revenues from foreign and luxury brands among the us based publicly traded automotive retailers 
since  foreign brands representing of our us revenue toyota lexus  honda acura  bmw mini  mercedes benz  audi and nissan infiniti have increased their us market share by more than 
we believe luxury and foreign brands will continue to offer us the opportunity to generate same store growth  including higher margin service and parts sales 
our revenue mix consists of related to premium brands  related to volume foreign brands  and relating to brands of us based manufacturers 
the following chart reflects our percentage of total revenues by brand in pie chart we sell and service outstanding automotive brands in our world class facilities  which are located in attractive geographic markets 
we believe offering these brands in world class facilities promotes repeat and referral business  particularly in our higher margin service and parts operations 
where advantageous  we attempt to aggregate our dealerships in a campus setting in order to build a destination location for our customers  which we believe helps to drive increased customer traffic to each of the brands at the location 
this strategy also creates an opportunity to reduce personnel expenses  consolidate advertising and administrative expenses and leverage operating expenses over a larger base of dealerships 
our dealerships have generally achieved new unit vehicle sales that are significantly higher than industry averages for the brands we sell

typically  customers may choose from an inventory of over  new and used vehicles  and have access to service bays with the capacity to service approximately  vehicles per day 
we will continue to evaluate other opportunities to aggregate our facilities to seek the benefits of a destination location 
maintain variable cost structure and diversified revenue stream a significant percentage of our operating expenses are variable  including sales compensation  floor plan interest expense inventory secured financing and advertising  which we believe we can manage over time to reflect economic trends 
gross profit generated from our service and parts business absorbs a substantial portion of our fixed expenses  excluding salespersons compensation and advertising 
in addition  recent experience has shown that demand for our higher margin service and parts business is less affected by economic cycles than demand for new vehicles and that we have been able to manage certain costs such as advertising and compensation expense in response to general industry conditions 
we benefit from a diversified revenue mix because of the multiple revenue streams in a traditional automotive dealership new vehicles  used vehicles  finance and insurance  and service and parts operations  revenue relating to the distribution of the smart fortwo vehicle  and returns relating to our joint venture investments 
we believe this diversification mitigates the cyclicality that has historically impacted some elements of the automotive sector 
we are further diversified within our retail automotive operations due to our brand mix and geographical dispersion 
our geographical dispersion includes dealerships in the us  puerto rico  and abroad  predominately in the uk diversification outside the us one of the unique attributes of our operations versus our peers is our diversification outside the us approximately of our consolidated revenue during was generated from operations located outside the us and puerto rico  predominately in the us according to industry data  the uk represented the fourth largest retail automotive market in western europe in with approximately million new vehicle registrations 
our brand mix in the uk is predominantly premium 
we believe that as of december   we were among the largest audi  bentley  bmw  ferrari  land rover  lexus  mercedes benz  maserati and porsche dealers in the uk based on number of dealerships 
additionally  we operate a number of dealerships in germany  some through joint ventures with experienced local partners  which sell and service audi  bmw  lexus  mini  porsche  toyota  volkswagen and various other premium brands 
smart distributorship smart usa  a wholly owned subsidiary  is the exclusive distributor of the smart fortwo vehicle in us and puerto rico 
the smart fortwo is manufactured by mercedes benz cars and is a daimler brand 
as distributor  smart usa is responsible for maintaining a vehicle dealership network in the us and puerto rico 
as of december   smart usa had certified a network of more than smart dealerships in states  nine of which are owned and operated by us 
smart usa wholesaled  smart fortwo vehicles in and  smart fortwo vehicles in 
table of contents investment in penske truck leasing in june  we acquired a limited partnership interest in ptl 
ptl operates and maintains more than  vehicles and serves customers in north america  south america  europe and asia 
product lines include full service leasing  contract maintenance  commercial and consumer truck rental and logistics services  including  transportation and distribution center management and supply chain management 
we currently expect to receive annual pro rata cash distributions of a portion of the partnership s profits and to realize us cash tax savings relating to tax attributes as a result of this investment 
expand revenues at existing locations and increase higher margin businesses we aim to increase same store sales  with a particular focus on developing our higher margin businesses such as finance  insurance and other product sales and service  parts and collision repair services 
increase same store sales 
we believe our emphasis on superior customer service and world class facilities will contribute to increases in same store sales over time 
we have added a significant number of incremental service bays in recent years in order to better accommodate our customers and further enhance our service and parts revenues 
grow finance  insurance and other aftermarket revenues 
each sale of a vehicle provides us the opportunity to assist in financing the sale of a vehicle  to sell the customer an extended service contract or other insurance product  and to sell aftermarket products  such as entertainment systems  security systems  satellite radios and protective coatings 
in order to improve our finance and insurance business  we focus on enhancing and standardizing our salesperson training programs  strengthening our product offerings and standardizing our selling processes through a menu driven product offering 
expand service and parts and collision repair revenues 
in recent years  we have added a significant number of service bays at our dealerships in an effort to expand this higher margin element of our business 
many of today s vehicles are complex and require sophisticated equipment and specially trained technicians to perform certain services 
unlike independent service shops  our dealerships are authorized to perform this work under warranties provided by manufacturers 
we believe that our brand mix and the complexity of today s vehicles  combined with our focus on customer service and superior facilities  will contribute to increases in our service and parts revenue 
we also operate collision repair centers which are operated as an integral part of our dealership operations 
as a result  the repair centers benefit from the dealerships repeat and referral business 
continue growth through targeted acquisitions we believe that attractive acquisition opportunities continue to exist for well capitalized dealership groups with experience in identifying  acquiring and integrating dealerships 
the automotive retail market provides us with significant growth opportunities in each of the markets in which we operate 
we generally seek to acquire dealerships with high growth automotive brands in highly concentrated or growing demographic areas 
we target larger dealership operations that will benefit from our management expertise  manufacturer relations and scale of operations  as well as smaller  single location dealerships that can be effectively integrated into our existing operations 
strengthen customer loyalty we strive to achieve and maintain superior levels of customer satisfaction by providing high quality products and services to meet our customers needs 
by offering outstanding brands in premium facilities  one stop shopping convenience  competitive pricing and a well trained and knowledgeable sales staff  we aim to forge lasting relationships with our customers  enhance our reputation in the community  and create the opportunity for significant repeat and referral business 
we believe that customer loyalty contributes directly to increases in same store sales 
we monitor customer satisfaction data accumulated by manufacturers to track the performance of dealership operations  and use it as a factor in determining the compensation of general managers and sales and service personnel in our dealerships 
we believe that our high customer satisfaction results have directly contributed to our operating results 
leverage scale and implement best practices we seek to build scale in many of the markets where we have dealership operations 
our desire is to reduce or eliminate redundant administrative costs such as accounting  information technology systems and other general administrative costs 
in addition  we seek to leverage our industry knowledge and experience to foster communication and cooperation between like brand dealerships throughout our organization 
senior management and dealership management meet regularly to review the operating performance of our dealerships  examine industry trends and  where appropriate  implement specific operating improvements 
key financial information is discussed and compared to other dealerships across all markets 
this frequent interaction facilitates implementation of successful strategies throughout the organization so that each of our dealerships can benefit from the successes of our other dealerships and the knowledge and experience of our senior management 

table of contents industry overview in  the majority of automotive retail sales in the us were generated by the approximately  franchised dealerships  producing revenues of approximately billion  including from new vehicle sales  from used vehicle sales and from service and parts sales 
dealerships also offer a wide range of higher margin products and services  including extended service contracts  financing arrangements and credit insurance 
the national automobile dealers association figures noted above include finance and insurance revenues within either new or used vehicle sales  as sales of these products are usually incremental to the sale of a vehicle 
germany and the uk represented the first and fourth largest european automotive retail markets in  with new car registrations of million and million vehicles  respectively 
in  uk and german automotive sales exceeded billion and billion  respectively 
combined  the uk and german markets make up approximately of the european market  based on new vehicle unit registrations 
the automotive retail industry in the u 
s and europe is highly fragmented and largely privately held 
in the us  publicly held automotive retail groups account for less than of total industry revenue 
according to industry data  the number of us franchised dealerships has declined from approximately  in to approximately  as of january  although significant consolidation has already taken place  the industry remains highly fragmented  with more than of the us industry s market share remaining in the hands of smaller regional and independent players 
we believe that further consolidation in the industry is probable due to the significant capital requirements of maintaining manufacturer facility standards  the limited number of viable alternative exit strategies for dealership owners and the impact of the current economic environment on smaller less well capitalized dealership groups 
generally  new vehicle unit sales are cyclical and  historically  fluctuations have been influenced by factors such as manufacturer incentives  interest rates  fuel prices  unemployment  inflation  weather  the level of personal discretionary spending  credit availability  consumer confidence and other general economic factors 
however  from a profitability perspective  automotive retailers have historically been less vulnerable than automobile manufacturers to declines in new vehicle sales 
we believe this may be due to the retailers more flexible expense structure a significant portion of the automotive retail industry s costs are variable  relating to sales personnel  advertising and inventory finance cost and their diversified revenue stream 
in addition  automobile manufacturers may offer various dealer incentives when sales are slow  which further increases the volatility in profitability for automobile manufacturers and may help to decrease volatility for automotive retailers 
acquisitions we routinely acquire and dispose of franchises 
our financial statements include the results of operations of acquired dealerships from the date of acquisition

table of contents management 
each dealership or group of dealerships has independent operational and financial management responsible for day to day operations 
we believe experienced local managers are better qualified to make day to day decisions concerning the successful operation of a dealership and can be more responsive to our customers needs 
we seek local dealership management that not only has experience in the automotive industry  but also is familiar with the local dealership s market 
we also have regional management that oversees operations at the individual dealerships and supports the dealerships operationally and administratively 
new vehicle retail sales 
in  we sold  new vehicles which generated of our retail revenue and of our retail gross profit 
we sell forty brands of domestic and import family  sports and premium cars  light trucks and sport utility vehicles in the us  puerto rico  the uk and germany 
new vehicles are typically acquired by dealerships directly from the manufacturer 
we strive to maintain outstanding relations with the automotive manufacturers  based in part on our long term presence in the automotive retail market  our commitment to providing premium facilities  the reputation of our management team and the consistent high sales volume from our dealerships 
our dealerships finance the purchase of most new vehicles from the manufacturers through floor plan financing provided by various manufacturers captive finance companies 
used vehicle retail sales 
in  we sold  used vehicles  which generated of our retail revenue and of our retail gross profit 
we acquire used vehicles from various sources  including auctions open only to authorized new vehicle dealers  public auctions  trade ins from consumers in connection with their purchase of a new vehicle from us and lease expirations or terminations 
vehicles returned at the end of a lease provide us with low mileage  late model vehicles for our used vehicle sales operations 
we clean  repair and recondition all used vehicles we acquire for resale 
we believe we may benefit from the opportunity to retain used vehicle retail customers as service and parts customers 
to improve customer confidence in our used vehicle inventory  each of our dealerships participates in all available manufacturer certification processes for used vehicles 
if certification is obtained  the used vehicle owner is typically provided benefits and warranties similar to those offered to new vehicle owners by the applicable manufacturer 
several of our dealerships have implemented software tools which assist in procuring and selling used vehicles 
through our scale in many markets  we have also implemented closed bid auctions that allow us to bring a large number of vehicles we do not intend to retail to a central market for other dealers or wholesalers to purchase 
in the uk  we also offer used vehicles for wholesale via an online auction 
we believe these strategies have resulted in greater operating efficiency and helped to reduce costs associated with maintaining optimal inventories 
vehicle finance  extended service and insurance sales 
finance and insurance sales represented of our retail revenue and of our retail gross profit in at our customers option  our dealerships can arrange third party financing or leasing for our customers vehicle purchases 
we typically receive a portion of the cost of financing or leasing paid by the customer for each transaction as compensation 
while these services are generally non recourse to us  we are subject to chargebacks in certain circumstances  such as default under a financing arrangement or prepayment 
these chargebacks vary by finance product but typically are limited to the fee income we receive absent a breach of our agreement with the third party finance or leasing company 
we provide training to our finance and insurance personnel to help assure compliance with internal policies and procedures  as well as applicable state regulations 
we also impose limits on the amount of revenue per transaction we may receive from certain finance products as part of our compliance efforts 
we also offer our customers various vehicle warranty and extended protection products  including extended service contracts  maintenance programs  guaranteed auto protection known as gap  this protection covers the shortfall between a customer s loan balance and insurance payoff in the event of a casualty  lease wear and tear insurance and theft protection products 
the extended service contracts and other products that our dealerships currently offer to customers are underwritten by independent third parties  including the vehicle manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries 
similar to finance transactions  we are subject to chargebacks relating to fees earned in connection with the sale of certain extended protection products 
we also offer for sale other aftermarket products  including satellite radio service  cellular phones  security systems and protective coatings 
we offer finance and insurance products using a menu process  which is designed to ensure that we offer our customers the complete range of finance  insurance  protection  and other aftermarket products in a transparent manner 
service and parts sales 
service and parts sales represented of our retail revenue and of our retail gross profit in we generate service and parts sales in connection with warranty and non warranty work performed at each of our dealerships 
we believe our service and parts revenues benefit from our increased service capacity and the increasingly complex technology used in vehicles that makes it difficult for independent repair facilities to maintain and repair today s automobiles 

table of contents a goal of each of our dealerships is to make each vehicle purchaser a customer of our service and parts department 
our dealerships keep detailed records of our customers maintenance and service histories  and many dealerships send reminders to customers when vehicles are due for periodic maintenance or service 
many of our dealerships have extended evening and weekend service hours for the convenience for our customers 
we also operate collision repair centers  each of which is operated as an integral part of our dealership operations 
internet presence 
we believe the majority of our customers will consult the internet for new and used automotive information 
in order to attract customers and enhance our customer service  each of our dealerships maintains its own website 
our corporate website  www 
penskeautomotive 
com  provides a link to each of our dealership websites allowing consumers to source information and communicate directly with our dealerships locally 
in the us and us  all of our dealership websites are presented in common formats except where otherwise required by manufacturers which helps to minimize costs and provide a consistent image across dealerships 
in addition  many automotive manufacturers websites provide links to our dealership websites and  in the uk  manufacturers also provide a website for the dealership 
using our dealership websites  consumers can review our vehicle inventory and access detailed information relating to the purchase process  including photos  prices  promotions  specifications  reviews and tools to schedule service appointments 
we believe these features make it easier for consumers to meet all of their automotive research needs

dealership data is gathered and processed through individual dealer systems utilizing a common dealer management system licensed from a third party 
each dealership is allowed to tailor the operational capabilities of that system locally  but we require that they follow our standardized accounting procedures 
our us network allows us to extract and aggregate information from the system in a consistent format to generate consolidating financial and operational data 
the system also allows us to access detailed information for each dealership individually  as a group  or on a consolidated basis 
information we can access includes  among other things  inventory  cash  unit sales  the mix of new and used vehicle sales and sales of aftermarket products and services 
our ability to access this data allows us to continually analyze these dealerships results of operations and financial position so as to identify areas for improvement 
our technology and processes also enable us to quickly integrate dealerships or dealership groups we acquire in the us our uk dealership financial  accounting and operational data is processed through a standard dealer management system licensed from a third party  except when otherwise required by the manufacturer

similar to the us  the us technology and processes enable us to continually analyze these dealerships results of operations and financial position so as to identify areas for improvement and to quickly integrate dealerships or dealership groups we acquire in the uk marketing our advertising and marketing efforts are focused at the local market level  with the aim of building our retail vehicle business  as well as repeat sales and service business 
we utilize many different media for our marketing activities  including newspapers  direct mail  magazines  television  radio and increasingly the internet and other digital media 
we also assist our local management in running special marketing events to generate sales 
automobile manufacturers supplement our local and regional advertising efforts through large advertising campaigns promoting their brands and promoting attractive financing packages and other incentive programs they may offer 
we believe that in some instances our scale has enabled us to obtain favorable terms from suppliers and advertising media  and should enable us to realize continued cost savings in marketing 
in an effort to realize increased efficiencies  we are focusing on common marketing metrics and business practices across our dealerships  as well as negotiating enterprise arrangements for targeted marketing resources 

table of contents in an effort to stimulate interest in the smart fortwo vehicle and vehicle sales  smart usa promotes and advertises the smart fortwo through press releases  advertising  and principally through local campaigns and events such as sponsored ride and drive events 
increasingly  smart usa has used the internet and other digital media to showcase and generate interest in the smart fortwo 
in  smart usa sponsored the smart usa advance program which gave dealers the ability to benefit from early adoption of the cash for clunkers governmental incentive  and has recently promoted several leasing incentives to facilitate customer acquisition of the smart fortwo 
agreements with vehicle manufacturers each of our dealerships operates under separate franchise agreements with the manufacturers of each brand of vehicle sold at that dealership 
these agreements may contain provisions and standards governing almost every aspect of the dealership  including ownership  management  personnel  training  maintenance of a minimum of working capital  net worth requirements  maintenance of minimum lines of credit  advertising and marketing activities  facilities  signs  products and services  maintenance of minimum amounts of insurance  achievement of minimum customer service standards and monthly financial reporting 
typically  the dealership principal and or the owner of a dealership may not be changed without the manufacturer s consent 
in exchange for complying with these provisions and standards  we are granted the non exclusive right to sell the manufacturer s brand of vehicles and related parts and warranty services at our dealerships 
the agreements also grant us a non exclusive license to use each manufacturer s trademarks  service marks and designs in connection with our sales and service of its brands at our dealerships 
some of our franchise agreements expire after a specified period of time  ranging from one to six years 
manufacturers have generally not terminated our franchise agreements  and our franchise agreements with fixed terms have typically been renewed without substantial cost 
we currently expect the manufacturers to renew all of our franchise agreements as they expire 
in addition  certain agreements may also limit the total number of dealerships of that brand that we may own in a particular geographic area and  in some cases  limit the total number of their vehicles that we may sell as a percentage of a particular manufacturer s overall sales 
manufacturers may also limit the ownership of stores in contiguous markets 
to date  we have reached the limit of the number of lexus dealerships we may own in the us  and we have reached certain geographical limitations with certain manufacturers in the us  such that without negotiated modifications to the agreements we cannot acquire additional franchises of those brands in certain us markets 
geographical limitations have historically had little impact on our ability to execute on our acquisition strategy 
many of these agreements also grant the manufacturer a security interest in the vehicles and or parts sold by the manufacturer to the dealership  as well as other dealership assets  and permit the manufacturer to terminate or not renew the agreement for a variety of causes  including failure to adequately operate the dealership  insolvency or bankruptcy  impairment of the dealer s reputation or financial standing  changes in the dealership s management  owners or location without consent  sales of the dealership s assets without consent  failure to maintain adequate working capital or floor plan financing  changes in the dealership s financial or other condition  failure to submit required information to the manufacturer on a timely basis  failure to have any permit or license necessary to operate the dealership  and material breaches of other provisions of the agreement 
in the us  these termination rights are subject to applicable state franchise laws that limit a manufacturer s right to terminate a franchise 
in the uk  we operate without such local franchise law protection see regulation below 
our agreements with manufacturers usually give the manufacturers the right  in some circumstances including upon a merger  sale  or change of control of the company  or in some cases a material change in our business or capital structure  to acquire from us  at fair market value  the dealerships that sell the manufacturers brands 
for example  our agreement with general motors provides that  upon a proposed sale of or more of our voting stock to any other person or entity other than for passive investment or another manufacturer  an extraordinary corporate transaction such as a merger  reorganization or sale of a material amount of assets or a change of control of our board of directors  general motors has the right to acquire all assets  properties and business of any general motors dealership owned by us for fair value 
in addition  general motors has a right of first refusal if we propose to sell any of our general motors dealerships to a third party 
some of our agreements with other major manufacturers contain provisions similar to the general motors provisions 
some of the agreements also prohibit us from pledging  or impose significant limitations on our ability to pledge  the capital stock of some of our subsidiaries to lenders 
we are also party to a distributor agreement with smart gmbh  pursuant to which we are the exclusive distributor of the smart fortwo in the us and puerto rico 
the agreement governs all aspects of our distribution rights  including sales and service activities  service and warranty terms  use of intellectual property  promotion and advertising provisions  pricing and payment terms  and indemnification requirements 
the agreement expires on december   subject to early termination by either party subject to various conditions set forth in the agreement  including the right by smart gmbh to cancel the agreement in the event it elects to discontinue production or distribution of the fortwo or a successor model in the us market  or in the event the chairman mr 
penske or president of smart usa is not participating in the smart distribution business for any reason and a replacement satisfactory to smart gmbh is not appointed within a reasonable period of time 
the parties have agreed to the apportionment of various potential payments in connection with the termination of the smart distributorship including obligations to smart dealers to repurchase vehicles and related expenses as outlined by our dealer agreement and state franchise laws see regulation in the us as outlined in the agreement 

table of contents competition for new vehicle sales  we compete primarily with other franchised dealers in each of our marketing areas 
we do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers  and typically we rely on our premium facilities  advertising and merchandising  management experience  sales expertise  service reputation and the location of our dealerships to compete for the sale of new vehicles 
each of our markets may include a number of well capitalized competitors that also have extensive automobile dealership managerial experience and strong retail locations and facilities 
in addition  we compete against dealerships owned by automotive manufacturers in some retail markets 
we compete with dealers that sell the same brands of new vehicles that we sell and with dealers that sell other brands of new vehicles that we do not represent in a particular market 
our new vehicle dealership competitors have franchise agreements with the various vehicle manufacturers and  as such  generally have access to new vehicles on the same terms as we do 
automotive dealers also face competition in the sale of new vehicles from on line purchasing services and warehouse clubs 
due to lower overhead and sales costs  these companies may be willing to offer products at lower prices than franchised dealers 
for used vehicle sales  we compete with other franchised dealers  independent used vehicle dealers  automobile rental agencies  on line purchasing services  private parties and used vehicle superstores for the procurement and resale of used vehicles 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in vehicle sales are the marketing campaigns conducted by manufacturers  the ability of dealerships to offer a wide selection of the most popular vehicles  the location of dealerships and the quality of customer experience 
other competitive factors include customer preference for particular brands of automobiles  pricing including manufacturer rebates and other special offers and warranties 
we believe that our dealerships are competitive in all of these areas 
with respect to arranging or providing financing for our customers vehicle purchases  we compete with a broad range of financial institutions 
we compete with other franchised dealers to perform warranty repairs and with other automotive dealers  franchised and non franchised service center chains  and independent garages for non warranty repair and routine maintenance business 
we compete with other automotive dealers  service stores and auto parts retailers in our parts operations 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in parts and service sales are price  the use of factory approved replacement parts  facility location  the familiarity with a manufacturer s brands and models and the quality of customer service 
a number of regional or national chains offer selected parts and services at prices that may be lower than our prices 
the automotive retail industry is currently served by franchised automotive dealerships  independent used vehicle dealerships and individual consumers who sell used vehicles in private transactions 
several other companies have established national or regional automotive retail chains 
additionally  vehicle manufacturers have historically engaged in the retail sale and service of vehicles  either independently or in conjunction with their franchised dealerships  and may do so on an expanded basis in the future  subject to various state laws that restrict or prohibit manufacturer ownership of dealerships 
we believe that a growing number of consumers are utilizing the internet and other digital media  to differing degrees  in connection with the purchase of vehicles 
accordingly  we may face increased pressure from on line automotive websites  including those developed by automobile manufacturers and other dealership groups 
consumers use the internet and other digital media to compare prices for vehicles and related services  which may result in reduced margins for new vehicles  used vehicles and related services 
with respect to distribution of the smart fortwo  smart usa competes with all other manufacturers and distributors of vehicles sold in the us  and in particular those in the small compact and sub compact segment 
while this segment has historically represented a small portion of the total us market  we expect increasing sales in the small vehicle segment in light of volatile gas prices and increasingly competitive offerings by other manufacturers in this segment which may also affect smart fortwo s current market share of this segment 

table of contents employees and labor relations as of december   we employed approximately  people  approximately of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements with labor unions 
we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 
our policy is to motivate our key managers through  among other things  variable compensation programs tied principally to dealership profitability 
due to our reliance on vehicle manufacturers  we may be adversely affected by labor strikes or work stoppages at the manufacturers facilities 
regulation we operate in a highly regulated industry and a number of regulations affect our business of marketing  selling  financing and servicing automobiles 
under the laws of the jurisdictions in which we currently operate or into which we may expand  we typically must obtain a license in order to establish  operate or relocate a dealership or operate an automotive repair service 
these laws also regulate our conduct of business  including our advertising  operating  financing  employment and sales practices 
other laws and regulations include franchise laws and regulations  environmental laws and regulations see environmental matters below  laws and regulations applicable to new and used motor vehicle dealers  as well as privacy  identity theft prevention  wage hour  anti discrimination and other employment practices laws 
our operations may also be subject to consumer protection laws 
these laws typically require a manufacturer or dealer to replace a new vehicle or accept it for a full refund within a period of time after initial purchase if the vehicle does not conform to the manufacturer s express warranties and the dealer or manufacturer  after a reasonable number of attempts  is unable to correct or repair the defect 
various laws also require various written disclosures to be provided on new vehicles  including mileage and pricing information 
our financing activities with customers are subject to truth in lending  consumer leasing  equal credit opportunity and similar regulations  as well as  motor vehicle finance laws  installment finance laws  insurance laws  usury laws and other installment sales laws 
some jurisdictions regulate finance fees that may be paid as a result of vehicle sales 
in recent years  private plaintiffs and state attorneys general in the us have increased their scrutiny of advertising  sales  and finance and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles 
in the us  we benefit from the protection of numerous state dealer laws that generally provide that a manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a franchise agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or non renewal 
some state dealer laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or to attempt to comply with the manufacturer s criteria within the notice period to avoid the termination or non renewal 
with respect to our smart distributorship  these franchise laws generally require that in the event of termination of a smart franchise  we are required to repurchase certain unsold inventories and provide other forms of termination assistance to the smart dealers 
europe generally does not have these laws and  as a result  our european dealerships operate without these protections 
in europe  rules limit automotive manufacturers block exemption to certain anti competitive rules in regards to establishing and maintaining a retail network 
as a result  existing manufacturer authorized retailers are able to  subject to manufacturer facility requirements  relocate or add additional facilities throughout the european union  offer multiple brands in the same facility  allow the operation of service facilities independent of new car sales facilities and ease restrictions on transfers of dealerships between existing franchisees within the european union 
environmental matters we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations  including those governing discharges into the air and water  the operation and removal of aboveground and underground storage tanks  the use  handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances and other materials and the investigation and remediation of contamination 
as with automotive dealerships generally  and service  parts and body shop operations in particular  our business involves the generation  use  handling and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes  including environmentally sensitive materials such as motor oil  filters  transmission fluid  antifreeze  refrigerant  waste paint and lacquer thinner  batteries  solvents  lubricants  degreasing agents  gasoline and diesel fuels 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 
our operations involving the management of hazardous and other environmentally sensitive materials are subject to numerous requirements 
our business also involves the operation of storage tanks containing such materials 
storage tanks are subject to periodic testing  containment  upgrading and removal under applicable law 
furthermore  investigation or remediation may be necessary in the event of leaks or other discharges from current or former underground or aboveground storage tanks 
in addition  water quality protection programs govern certain discharges from some of our operations 
similarly  certain air emissions from our operations  such as auto body painting  may be subject to relevant laws 
various health and safety standards also apply to our operations 

table of contents we may have liability in connection with materials that were sent to third party recycling  treatment  and or disposal facilities under the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and comparable statutes 
these statutes impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination 
responsible parties under these statutes may include the owner or operator of the site where the contamination occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances released at these sites 
an expanding trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment 
vehicle manufacturers are subject to federally mandated corporate average fuel economy standards  which will increase substantially as a result of legislation passed in furthermore  in response to recent studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases  referred to as greenhouse gases  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere  climate change related legislation and policy changes to restrict greenhouse gas emissions are being considered at state and federal levels 
significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide that may be imposed on vehicles and automobile fuels in the us could adversely affect demand for the vehicles that we sell 
we believe that we do not have any material environmental liabilities and that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
however  soil and groundwater contamination is known to exist at certain of our current or former properties 
further  environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to change 
in addition  in connection with our acquisitions  it is possible that we will assume or become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities  some of which may be material 
compliance with current  amended  new or more stringent laws or regulations  stricter interpretations of existing laws or the future discovery of environmental conditions could require additional expenditures by us  and such expenditures could be material 
in an effort to improve our operating costs and be responsible in the area of environmentally sustainable practice  we are pursuing many measures with respect to the design and construction of our dealerships 
as a result of our efforts  our smart usa dealerships located in connecticut and michigan have obtained leadership in energy and environmental design leed certifications 
the united states green building council usgbc  an internationally recognized nonprofit organization  awards the prestigious leed certification to buildings that have achieved an outstanding rating in energy efficiency and resource conservation in five categories  consisting of sustainable sites  water efficiency  energy and the atmosphere  material resources  and indoor environmental quality 
insurance the automotive retail industry is subject to substantial risk of loss due to the significant concentration of property values at dealership locations  including vehicles and parts 
in addition  we are exposed to other potential liabilities arising out of our operations  including claims by employees  customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage and potential fines and penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements 
as a result  we require significant levels of insurance covering a broad variety of risks 
we purchase insurance  including umbrella and excess insurance policies  subject to specified deductibles and significant loss retentions 
the level of risk we retain may change in the future as insurance market conditions or other factors affecting the economics of purchasing insurance change 
we are exposed to uninsured and underinsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in certain instances  we post letters of credit to support our loss retentions and deductibles 
we  penske corporation  which is our largest stockholder  and certain affiliates have entered into a joint insurance agreement which provides that  with respect to any joint insurance currently only our joint crime insurance policy  available coverage with respect to a loss shall be paid to each party per occurrence as stipulated in the policies 
in the event of losses by us and penske corporation that exceed the limit of liability for any policy or policy period  the total policy proceeds will be allocated based on the ratio of premiums paid 
for information regarding our relationship with penske corporation  see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations related party transactions 

table of contents seasonality our business is modestly seasonal overall 
our us operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
also  vehicle demand  and to a lesser extent demand for service and parts  is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the us where dealerships may be subject to severe winters 
our us operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the first and third quarters of each year  due primarily to vehicle registration practices in the uk available information for selected financial information concerning our various operating and geographic segments  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report

risk factors our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  and prospects  and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock  may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the matters discussed below 
certain statements and information set forth in this annual report on form k  as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized officers on our behalf  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal private securities litigation reform act of words such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  may  plans  seeks  projects  will  would  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
we intend for our forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of  and we set forth this statement in order to comply with such safe harbor provisions 
you should note that our forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this annual report on form k or when made and we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise our forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
although we believe that the expectations  plans  intentions  and projections reflected in our forward looking statements are reasonable  such statements are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance  or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance  or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
the risks  uncertainties  and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include  but are not limited to  the following risk relating to our business our business is susceptible to adverse economic conditions  including changes in customer demand  changes in consumer confidence  changes in fuel prices and reduced credit availability 
we believe that the automotive retail industry is influenced by general economic conditions  consumer confidence  personal discretionary spending  interest rates  fuel prices  credit availability and unemployment rates 
the worldwide automotive industry experienced significant operational and financial difficulties in and the turbulence in worldwide credit markets and resulting decrease in the availability of financing and leasing alternatives for consumers hampered our sales efforts 
continued or further restricted credit availability could materially adversely affect our operations as many of our retail sales customers purchase vehicles using credit 
in  volatility in fuel prices impacted consumer preferences and caused dramatic swings in consumer demand for various vehicle models  which led to supply and demand imbalances 
since september  there has been reduced consumer confidence and spending in the markets in which we operate  which we believe has resulted in reduced customer traffic in our dealerships 
we believe continued adverse economic conditions will negatively affect our business 

table of contents historically  unit sales of motor vehicles  particularly new vehicles  have been cyclical  fluctuating with general economic cycles 
during periods of economic downturn  such as the latter half of and  new vehicle retail sales tend to experience periods of decline characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
the automotive retail industry may experience sustained periods of decline in vehicle sales in the future  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
risks relating to automotive manufacturers automotive manufacturers exercise significant control over our operations and we depend on them in order to operate our business 
each of our dealerships operates under franchise agreements with automotive manufacturers or related distributors 
we are dependent on these parties because  without a franchise agreement  we cannot operate a new vehicle franchise or perform manufacturer authorized warranty service 
manufacturers exercise a great degree of control over the operations of our dealerships 
for example  manufacturers can require our dealerships to meet specified standards of appearance  require individual dealerships to meet specified financial criteria such as the maintenance of a minimum of net working capital and a minimum net worth  impose minimum customer service and satisfaction standards  restrict the use of manufacturers names and trademarks and consent to the replacement of the dealership principal 
our franchise agreements may be terminated or not renewed by automotive manufacturers for a variety of reasons  including unapproved changes of ownership or management and other material breaches of the franchise agreements 
we have  from time to time  not been compliant with various provisions of some of our franchise agreements 
our operations in the uk operate without local franchise law protection  and we are aware of efforts by certain manufacturers not to renew their franchise agreements with certain other retailers in the uk although we believe that we will be able to renew all of our existing franchise agreements at expiration  if any of our significant existing franchise agreements or a large number of franchise agreements are not renewed or the terms of any such renewal are materially unfavorable to us  our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  actions taken by manufacturers to exploit their bargaining position in negotiating the terms of renewals of franchise agreements could also materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
while us franchise laws give us limited protection in selling a manufacturer s product within a given geographic area  our franchise agreements do not give us the exclusive right to sell vehicles within a given area 
in europe  rules limit automotive manufacturers block exemption to certain anti competitive rules in regards to establishing and maintaining a retail network 
as a result  authorized retailers are able  subject to manufacturer facility requirements  to relocate or add additional facilities throughout the european union  offer multiple brands in the same facility  allow the operation of service facilities independent of new car sales facilities and ease restrictions on transfers of dealerships between existing franchisees within the european union 
changes to these rules adverse to us could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we depend on manufacturers to provide us with a desirable mix of popular new vehicles  which tend to produce the highest profit margins 
manufacturers generally allocate their vehicles among dealerships based on the sales history of each dealership 
our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of the most popular models  whether due to sales declines at our dealerships or otherwise  could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
our volumes and profitability may be adversely affected if automotive manufacturers reduce or discontinue their incentive programs 
our dealerships depend on the manufacturers for sales incentives  warranties and other programs that promote and support vehicle sales at our dealerships 
some of these programs include customer rebates  dealer incentives  special financing or leasing terms and warranties 
manufacturers frequently change their incentive programs 
if manufacturers reduce or discontinue incentive programs  our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
adverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers may negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
our success depends on the overall success of the line of vehicles that each of our dealerships sells 
as a result  our success depends to a great extent on the automotive manufacturers financial condition  marketing  vehicle design  production and distribution capabilities  reputation  management and labor relations 
in  bmw mini  toyota lexus brands  honda acura  daimler and audi brands accounted for    and  respectively  of our total revenues 
a significant decline in the sale of new vehicles manufactured by these manufacturers  or the loss or deterioration of our relationships with one or more of these manufacturers  could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
no other manufacturer accounted for more than of our total revenues for 
table of contents events such as labor strikes that may adversely affect a manufacturer may also materially adversely affect us  especially if these events were to interrupt the supply of vehicles or parts to us 
similarly  the delivery of vehicles from manufacturers at a time later than scheduled  which may occur during periods of new product introductions  could lead to reduced sales during those periods 
in addition  any event that causes adverse publicity involving one or more automotive manufacturers or their vehicles may materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
for example  in january  toyota temporarily suspended the production of eight of its vehicle models  and expanded its previous recall for certain existing vehicles  due to reports of unintended vehicle acceleration  and subsequently issued a recall of its prius model due to brake issues 
while we expect that these actions will adversely impact our toyota new and used unit sales for some period  the long term impact of lower revenue due to any diminution to toyota s reputation  or consumers confidence in or preference for toyota s vehicles  taken together with any potential increase in revenue from repair activities related to the toyota recall  is difficult to predict 
further restructuring of one of the us based automotive manufacturers or a significant supplier may adversely affect our operations  as well as the us automotive sector as a whole 
us based automotive manufacturers have been experiencing decreasing us market share in recent years 
beginning in  these manufacturers also experienced significant operational and financial distress  due in part to shrinking market share in the us and the recent limitation in worldwide credit capacity 
in and early  certain of these manufacturers filed for bankruptcy protection 
while we have limited exposure to these manufacturers in terms of the percentage of our overall revenue  further restructuring efforts by any one of them or restructuring efforts at any of the other manufacturers we represent would likely lead to significant disruption to our dealerships that represent them  including  but not limited to  a loss of availability of new vehicle inventory  reduced consumer demand for vehicle inventory  the loss of funding for existing or future inventory  non payment of receivables due from that manufacturer  and or the cancellation of our franchise agreement without cancellation of our underlying lease and other obligations 
such restructuring of one of these manufacturers could also impact other automotive manufacturers and suppliers 
we cannot reasonably predict the impact to the automotive retail environment of any such disruption  but believe it would be significant and adverse to the industry as a whole 
any restructuring of a significant automotive supplier  due to limited liquidity or credit availability or otherwise may have similar consequences 
our failure to meet manufacturers consumer satisfaction requirements may adversely affect us 
many manufacturers track customers satisfaction with their sales and warranty service experiences through measures that are generally known as customer satisfaction indices  or csi 
manufacturers sometimes use a dealership s csi scores as a factor in evaluating applications for additional dealership acquisitions 
certain of our dealerships have not met their manufacturers csi standards  and we may be unable to meet these standards in the future 
a manufacturer may refuse to consent to a franchise acquisition by us if our dealerships do not meet their csi standards 
this could materially adversely affect our acquisition strategy 
in addition  because we receive incentive payments from the manufacturers based in part on csi scores  future payments could be materially reduced or eliminated if our csi scores decline 
automotive manufacturers impose limits on our ability to issue additional equity and on the ownership of our common stock by third parties  which may hamper our ability to meet our financing needs 
a number of manufacturers impose restrictions on the sale and transfer of our common stock 
the most prohibitive restrictions provide that  under specified circumstances  we may be forced to sell or surrender franchises if a competing automotive manufacturer acquires a or greater ownership interest in us or if an individual or entity that has a criminal record in connection with business dealings with any automotive manufacturer  distributor or dealer or who has been convicted of a felony acquires a or greater ownership interest in us 
further  certain manufacturers have the right to approve the acquisition by a third party of or more of our common stock  and a number of manufacturers continue to prohibit changes in ownership that may affect control of our company 
actions by our stockholders or prospective stockholders that would violate any of the above restrictions are generally outside our control 
if we are unable to obtain a waiver or relief from these restrictions  we may be forced to terminate or sell one or more franchises  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
these restrictions also may prevent or deter prospective acquirers from acquiring control of us and  therefore  may adversely impact the value of our common stock 
these restrictions also may impede our ability to raise required capital or our ability to acquire dealership groups using our common stock 

table of contents risks relating to our acquisition strategy growth in our revenues and earnings depends on our ability to acquire and successfully operate new dealerships 
we expect to acquire new dealerships  however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify and acquire additional dealerships in the future 
moreover  acquisitions involve a number of risks  including integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired dealerships  operating in new markets with which we may not be familiar  incurring unforeseen liabilities at acquired dealerships  disruption to our existing business  failure to retain key personnel of the acquired dealerships  and impairment of relationships with employees  manufacturers and customers 
in addition  integrating acquired dealerships into our existing mix of dealerships may result in substantial costs  diversion of our management resources or other operational or financial problems 
unforeseen expenses  difficulties and delays that may be encountered in connection with the integration of acquired entities and the rapid expansion of operations could inhibit our growth  result in our failure to achieve acquisition synergies or require us to focus resources on integration rather than other more profitable areas 
acquired entities may subject us to unforeseen liabilities that we did not detect prior to completing the acquisition  or liabilities that turn out to be greater than those we had expected 
these liabilities may include liabilities that arise from non compliance with environmental laws by prior owners for which we  as a successor owner  may be responsible 
we may also be unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates  or unable to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms on a timely basis 
the magnitude  timing  pricing and nature of future acquisitions will depend upon various factors  including the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities  the availability of skilled employees to manage the acquired companies and general economic and business conditions 
further  we may need to borrow funds to complete future acquisitions  which funds may not be available 
furthermore  we have sold and may in the future sell dealerships based on numerous factors  which may impact our future revenues and earnings  particularly if we do not make acquisitions to replace such revenues and earnings 
manufacturers restrictions on acquisitions may limit our future growth 
our future growth via acquisition of automotive dealerships will depend on our ability to obtain the requisite manufacturer approvals 
the relevant manufacturer must consent to any franchise acquisition and it may not consent in a timely fashion or at all 
in addition  under many franchise agreements or under local law  a manufacturer may have a right of first refusal to acquire a dealership that we seek to acquire 
some manufacturers limit the total number of their dealerships that we may own in a particular geographic area and  in some cases  limit the total number of their vehicles that we may sell as a percentage of that manufacturer s overall sales 
manufacturers may also limit the ownership of stores in contiguous markets 
to date  we have reached the limit of the number of lexus dealerships we may own in the us  and we have reached certain geographical limitations with certain manufacturers in the us  such that without negotiated modifications to our agreements with those manufacturers we would not be able to acquire additional franchises of those brands in certain markets 
if additional manufacturers impose or expand these types of restrictions  our acquisition strategy  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents other business risks substantial competition in automotive sales and services may adversely affect our profitability 
the automotive retail industry is highly competitive 
depending on the geographic market  we compete with franchised automotive dealerships in our markets that sell the same or similar new and used vehicles that we offer  private market buyers and sellers of used vehicles  internet based vehicle brokers that sell vehicles obtained from franchised dealers directly to consumers  vehicle rental companies that sell their used rental vehicles  service center chain stores  and independent service and repair shops 
we also compete against automotive manufacturers in some retail markets  which may negatively affect our operating results  financial condition or cash flows 
some of our competitors may have greater financial  marketing and personnel resources and lower overhead and sales costs than us 
we do not have any cost advantage over other franchised automotive dealerships when purchasing new vehicles from the automotive manufacturers 
in addition to competition for vehicle sales  our dealerships compete with franchised dealerships to perform warranty repairs and with other automotive dealers  independent service center chains  independent garages and others in connection with our non warranty repair  routine maintenance and parts business 
a number of regional or national chains offer selected parts and services at prices that may be lower than our dealerships prices 
we also compete with a broad range of financial institutions in arranging financing for our customers vehicle purchases 
in addition  customers are using the internet and other digital media to compare pricing for cars and related finance and insurance services  which may reduce our profit margins on those lines of business 
some websites offer vehicles for sale over the internet without being a franchised dealer  although they must currently source their vehicles from a franchised dealer 
if new vehicle sales made over the internet are allowed to be conducted without the involvement of franchised dealers  or if dealerships are able to effectively use the internet to sell outside of their markets  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we could also be materially adversely affected to the extent that internet companies acquire dealerships or ally themselves with our competitors dealerships 
the success of our distribution of the smart fortwo is directly impacted by availability and consumer demand for this vehicle 
we are the exclusive distributor of the smart fortwo vehicle in the us and puerto rico 
the profitability of this business depends upon the number of vehicles we distribute  which in turn is impacted by consumer demand for this vehicle 
we distributed  smart fortwo vehicles in and  vehicles in we believe demand for the smart fortwo is subject to the same general economic conditions  consumer confidence  personal discretionary spending  interest rates and credit availability that impact the retail automotive industry generally 
because the smart fortwo is a vehicle with high fuel economy  future demand may be more responsive to changes in fuel prices than other vehicles 
in the event sales of the smart fortwo are less than we expect  our related results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to purchase commitments pursuant to the smart distribution agreement  which requires us to purchase a number of vehicles to be negotiated on an ongoing basis 
in addition  we are potentially subject to a purchase commitment with respect to unsold inventories and other items pursuant to the smart franchise agreement and state franchise laws in the event of franchise terminations 
to the extent we are required to purchase vehicles that we are unable to distribute to franchised dealers  or repurchase vehicles from dealerships that we are unable to distribute to other franchised dealers  our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected 
the smart fortwo is manufactured by mercedes benz cars at its hambach  france factory 
in the event of a supply disruption or if sufficient quantities of the smart fortwo are not made available to us  or if we accept vehicles and are unable to economically distribute those vehicles to the smart dealership network  our cash flows or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

table of contents our capital costs and our results of operations may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment 
we finance our purchases of new and  to a lesser extent  used vehicle inventory using floor plan financing arrangements under which we are charged interest at floating rates 
in addition  we obtain capital for general corporate purposes  dealership acquisitions and real estate purchases and improvements under predominantly floating interest rate credit facilities 
therefore  excluding the potential mitigating effects from interest rate hedging techniques  our interest expenses will rise with increases in interest rates 
rising interest rates may also have the effect of depressing demand in the interest rate sensitive aspects of our business  including new and used vehicles sales  because many of our customers finance their vehicle purchases 
as a result  rising interest rates may have the effect of simultaneously increasing our costs and reducing our revenues  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
our interest costs may also rise independent of general interest rates 
for example  the dislocation of worldwide credit markets has resulted in an increase in the cost of capital for the captive finance subsidiaries that provide us financing for our inventory procurement 
certain of those companies have responded by increasing the cost of such financing to us 
materially increased interest costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
our substantial indebtedness and lease commitments may limit our ability to obtain financing for acquisitions and may require that a significant portion of our cash flow be used for debt service  debt repayment and lease payments 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of december   we had approximately billion of floor plan notes payable outstanding and million of total non floor plan debt outstanding  including million of senior subordinated convertible notes  net of debt discount  currently expected to be redeemed in april or otherwise refinanced on or prior thereto 
as of december   million of term loans  million of letters of credit and no revolving borrowings were outstanding under our us credit agreement and outstanding loans under our us credit agreement amounted to million million  including million million under the term loan 
as of december   we had the ability to draw on up to million of unutilized debt capacity under our credit facilities 
we have historically structured our operations so as to minimize our ownership of real property 
as a result  we lease or sublease substantially all of our dealerships properties and other facilities 
these leases are generally for a period of between five and years  and are typically structured to include renewal options at our election 
our total rent obligations under those leases  including extension periods we may exercise at our discretion and assuming constant consumer price indices  is currently estimated to be approximately billion 
our substantial debt and operating lease commitments could have important consequences 
for example  they could make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing in the future for our acquisitions and operations  working capital requirements  capital expenditures  debt service or other general corporate requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to repay debt and related interest rather than other areas of our business  limit our operating flexibility due to financial and other restrictive covenants  including restrictions on incurring additional debt  creating liens on our properties  making acquisitions or paying dividends  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and make us more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic or industry conditions or a downturn in our business 
our ability to meet our lease and debt service and repayment obligations depends on our future performance  which will be impacted by general economic conditions and by financial  business and other competitive factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors could include operating difficulties  increased operating costs  the actions of competitors  regulatory developments and delays in implementing our growth strategies 
our ability to meet our debt and lease obligations may depend on our success in implementing our business strategies  and we may not be able to implement our business strategies or the anticipated results of our strategies may not be realized 
if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future sufficient borrowings are not available to us  we may not be able to service or repay our debt or leases or to fund our other liquidity needs 
in that event  we may have to delay or cancel acquisitions  sell equity securities  sell assets or restructure or refinance our debt 
if we are unable to service or repay our debt or leases  we may not be able to pursue these options on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of our existing or future franchise agreements  agreements with manufacturers or debt agreements may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives 

table of contents if we are unable to refinance or repay our senior subordinated convertible notes in april  our overall liquidity position may be materially adversely affected 
in january  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes due the convertible notes  of which million is currently outstanding million on december  
holders of the convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their convertible notes for cash on april   at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be purchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the applicable purchase date 
we currently expect to redeem the convertible notes in april or otherwise refinance the notes on or prior thereto 
if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future sufficient borrowings are not available to us  we may not be able to refinance or repay the convertible notes 
in that event  we may have to delay or cancel acquisitions  sell equity securities  sell assets or restructure or refinance the convertible notes and our other indebtedness 
if these efforts are not successful  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely impacted  including by resulting in cross defaults of substantially all of our other indebtedness 
our inability to raise capital for the purchase of vehicle inventory or otherwise could adversely affect us 
we depend to a significant extent on our ability to finance the purchase of inventory in the form of floor plan financing 
floor plan financing is financing from a vehicle manufacturer or third party secured by the vehicles we sell 
our dealerships borrow money to buy a particular vehicle from the manufacturer and generally pay off the floor plan financing when they sell the particular vehicle  paying interest during the interim period 
our floor plan financing is secured by substantially all of the assets of our automotive dealership subsidiaries 
our remaining assets are pledged to secure our credit facilities 
this may impede our ability to borrow from other sources 
most of our floor plan lenders are associated with manufacturers with whom we have franchise agreements 
consequently  the deterioration of our relationship with a manufacturer could adversely affect our relationship with the affiliated floor plan lender and vice versa 
any inability to obtain floor plan financing on customary terms  or the termination of our floor plan financing arrangements by our floor plan lenders  could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we require substantial capital in order to acquire and renovate automotive dealerships 
this capital has historically been raised through public or private financing  including through the issuance of debt or equity securities  sale leaseback transactions and other sources 
availability under our credit agreements may be limited by the covenants and conditions of those facilities and we may not be able to raise additional funds 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to then existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly curtail our acquisition and renovation programs  which could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy 
our failure to comply with our debt and operating lease covenants could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our us credit agreement  us credit agreement  and certain operating leases contain financial and operating covenants 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the applicable agreement 
if a default were to occur  we would likely seek a waiver of that default  attempt to reset the covenant  or refinance the instrument and accompanying obligations 
if we were unable to obtain this relief  the default could result in the acceleration of that debt or lease obligation 
in addition  these agreements  as well as the indentures that govern our notes and our convertible notes  contain cross default provisions such that a default under one agreement could result in a default under all of our significant financing and operating agreements 
if a default and or cross default were to occur  we may not be able to pay our debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them 
any of these events  if they occur  could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
we depend on the performance of sublessees to offset costs related to certain of our lease agreements and if the sublessees do not perform as expected  we could experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
since  we have sold a number of dealerships to third parties 
as a condition to the sale  we have at times remained liable for the lease payments relating to the properties on which those franchises operate 
we are also party to lease agreements on properties that we no longer use in our retail operations that we have sublet to third parties 
the aggregate rent paid by the tenants on those properties in was approximately million and  in aggregate  we guarantee or are otherwise liable for approximately million of lease payments  including lease payments during available renewal periods 
we rely on the subtenants to pay the rent and maintain the properties covered by these leases 
in the event a subtenant does not perform as expected due to their financial condition or other factors such as the market performance of the underlying vehicle manufacturer  we may not be able to recover amounts owed to us 
in either event  we could be required to fulfill these obligations  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents shares eligible for future sale may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
the potential for sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market may have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
the majority of our outstanding shares are held by two shareholders  each of whom has registration rights that could result in a substantial number of shares being sold in the market 
in addition to outstanding shares eligible for sale   shares of our common stock are issuable under currently outstanding stock options granted to employees of the company 
an additional  shares of common stock are reserved for issuance to employees under equity incentive plans 
in addition  we have reserved  shares for issuance under our senior subordinated convertible notes due  which  if issued  would result in substantial dilution to common shareholders and could adversely effect our stock price 
finally  we have a significant amount of authorized but unissued shares that  if issued  could materially adversely effect our stock price 
we cannot determine the impact on the market price of our common stock of these shares which are eligible for sale in the market 
property loss  business interruptions or other liabilities at some of our dealerships could impact our results of operations 
the automotive retail business is subject to substantial risk of loss due to the significant concentration of property values at dealership locations  including vehicles and parts 
we have historically experienced business interruptions at several of our dealerships due to adverse weather conditions or other extraordinary events  such as wild fires in california or hurricanes in florida 
other potential liabilities arising out of our operations involve claims by employees  customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage and potential fines and penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements 
to the extent we experience future similar events  our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows may be materially adversely impacted 
we rely on the management information systems at our dealerships  which are licensed from third parties and are used in all aspects of our sales and service efforts  as well as in the preparation of our consolidating financial and operating data 
these systems are principally provided by one supplier in the us and one supplier in the uk to the extent these systems become unavailable to us for any reason  or if our relationship deteriorates with either of our two principal suppliers  our business could be significantly disrupted which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel  our business could be adversely affected 
we believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive management and key employees  including  in particular  roger s 
penske  our chairman and chief executive officer 
in addition  certain of our agreements provide the counterparty with certain rights in the event mr 
penske no longer participates in our business 
for example  the general distribution agreement pursuant to which we distribute the smart fortwo provides smart gmbh the right to terminate in the event mr 
penske is not participating in the smart distribution business for any reason and a replacement satisfactory to smart gmbh is not appointed within a reasonable period of time 
additionally  our business is dependent upon our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel  including retaining dealership management in connection with acquisitions 
we generally have not entered into employment agreements with our key personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management team  including  in particular  roger s 
penske  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we do not have key man insurance for any of our executive officers or key personnel 
the loss of any of our key employees or the failure to attract qualified managers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to substantial regulation  claims and legal proceedings  any of which could adversely affect our profitability 
a number of regulations affect marketing  selling  financing  distributing and servicing automobiles 
these laws also regulate our conduct of business  including our advertising  operating  financing  employment and sales practices 
our foreign operations are subject to similar regulations in their respective jurisdictions 
our financing activities with customers are subject to truth in lending  consumer leasing  equal credit opportunity and similar regulations as well as motor vehicle finance laws  installment finance laws  insurance laws  usury laws and other installment sales laws 
some jurisdictions regulate finance fees that may be paid as a result of vehicle sales and have increased scrutiny of advertising  sales  and finance and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles 
in the event of regulation restricting our ability to generate revenue from arranging financing for our customers  we could be adversely affected 
we could also be susceptible to claims or related actions if we fail to operate our business in accordance with applicable laws 
claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us or any of our dealers by individuals  either individually or through class actions  or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings 
such actions may expose us to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs  injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties  including suspension or revocation of our licenses and franchises to conduct dealership operations 

table of contents we are involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business including litigation with customers regarding our products and services  and expect to continue to be subject to claims related to our existing business and any new business 
a significant judgment against us or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and future prospects 
if state franchise laws in the us are repealed or weakened  our dealership franchise agreements will be more susceptible to termination  non renewal or renegotiation 
state dealer laws in the us generally provide that an automotive manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a franchise agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or non renewal 
some state franchise laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or to attempt to comply with the manufacturer s criteria within the notice period to avoid the termination or non renewal 
if franchise laws are repealed in the states in which we operate  manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without advance notice  an opportunity to cure  or a showing of good cause 
without the protection of state franchise laws  it may also be more difficult for our us dealerships to renew their franchise agreements upon expiration  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
jurisdictions outside the us generally do not have these laws and  as a result  operate without these protections 
our dealerships are subject to environmental regulations that may result in claims and liabilities which could be material 
we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations  including those governing discharges into the air and water  the operation and removal of storage tanks and the use  storage and disposal of hazardous substances 
our dealerships and service  parts and body shop operations in particular use  store and contract for recycling or disposal of hazardous materials 
any non compliance with these regulations could result in significant fines  penalties and remediation costs which could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in the us  we may also have liability in connection with materials that were sent to third party recycling  treatment  and or disposal facilities under federal and state statutes 
in that case  regulations may make us responsible for liability relating to the investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination 
in connection with our acquisitions  it is possible that we will assume or become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities  some of which may be material 
in connection with dispositions of businesses  or dispositions previously made by companies we acquire  we may retain exposure for environmental costs and liabilities  some of which may be material 
an expanding trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment  and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
vehicle manufacturers are subject to federally mandated corporate average fuel economy standards  which will increase substantially over the next several years 
furthermore  in response to recent studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases  referred to as greenhouse gases  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere  climate change related legislation to restrict greenhouse gas emissions is being considered at the state and federal level to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide that may be imposed on vehicles and automobile fuels could adversely affect demand for some of the vehicles that we sell 
environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to change 
compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations  stricter interpretations of existing laws  or the future discovery of environmental conditions could require additional expenditures by us which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
our principal stockholders have substantial influence over us and may make decisions with which you disagree 
penske corporation through various affiliates beneficially owns of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  penske corporation and its affiliates have entered into a stockholders agreement with our second largest stockholder  mitsui co  ltd 
and one of its affiliates  pursuant to which they have agreed to vote together as to the election of our directors 
collectively  these two groups beneficially own of our outstanding stock 
as a result  these persons have the ability to control the composition of our board of directors and therefore they may be able to control the direction of our affairs and business 
this concentration of ownership  as well as various provisions contained in our agreements with manufacturers  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the delaware general corporation law  could have the affect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of us or unsolicited acquisition proposals 
these provisions include the stock ownership limits imposed by various manufacturers and our ability to issue blank check preferred stock and the interested stockholder provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 

table of contents some of our directors and officers may have conflicts of interest with respect to certain related party transactions and other business interests 
some of our executive officers also hold executive positions at other companies affiliated with our largest stockholder 
roger s 
penske  our chairman and chief executive officer  is also chairman and chief executive officer of penske corporation  a diversified transportation services company 
robert h 
kurnick  jr  our president and a director  is also president of penske corporation and hiroshi ishikawa  our executive vice president international business development and a director  serves in a similar capacity for penske corporation 
much of the compensation of these officers is paid by penske corporation and not by us  and while these officers have historically devoted a substantial amount of their time to our matters  these officers are not required to spend any specific amount of time on our matters 
furthermore  one of our directors  richard j 
peters serves as a director of penske corporation 
in addition  penske corporation owns penske motor group  a privately held automotive dealership company with operations in southern california 
periodically  we have purchased or sold real property and improvements to automotive group reality  a wholly owned subsidiary of penske corporation  which in some cases we have then leased 
due to their relationships with these related entities  messrs 
ishikawa  kurnick  penske  and peters may have a conflict of interest in making any decision related to transactions between their related entities and us  or with respect to allocations of corporate opportunities 
penske corporation has pledged its shares of common stock to secure a loan facility 
penske corporation and certain of its affiliates have pledged all of their shares of our common stock as collateral to secure a loan facility 
if a default under the loan facility were to occur  penske corporation would likely seek a waiver of that default  attempt to reset any covenant breached  or refinance the instrument and accompanying obligations 
if it were unable to obtain this relief  under certain circumstances  the lenders under these loans could elect to foreclose on these shares 
the market price of our common stock could materially decline if the lenders were to sell the pledged shares in the open market 
in addition  a foreclosure on the shares by the lenders could materially affect penske corporation s voting rights relating to our company and our relationships with the automotive manufacturers we represent 
see automotive manufacturers impose limits on our ability to issue additional equity and on the ownership of our common stock by third parties  which may hamper our ability to meet our financing needs 
a substantial decrease in penske corporation s ownership of our company could also lead to a default under or termination of existing or future agreements of ours 
for example  the trademark agreement pursuant to which we license the penske name could be terminated months after the date that penske corporation and certain of its affiliates no longer own at least of our voting stock 
our operations outside the us are subject to foreign currency risk and other risks associated with operating in foreign jurisdictions 
in recent years  between and of our revenues have been generated outside the us  predominately in the us as a result  we are exposed to the risks involved in foreign operations  including changes in foreign currency rates  changes in international tax laws and treaties  including increases of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  tariffs  trade barriers  and restrictions on the transfer of funds between nations  changes in international governmental regulations  the impact of local economic and political conditions  and the impact of european commission regulation and the relationship between the uk and continental europe 
if our operations outside the us fail to perform as expected  we will be adversely impacted 
in addition  our results of operations and financial position are reported in the local currency and are then translated into us dollars at applicable foreign currency exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
as exchange rates fluctuate  particularly between the us and us  our results of operations as reported in us dollars will fluctuate 
for example  if the us dollar were to strengthen against the us pound  our uk results of operations would translate into less uk dollar reported results 
because a significant portion of our new vehicle business involves the sale of vehicles  vehicle parts or vehicles composed of parts that are manufactured outside the region in which they are sold  our operations are subject to customary risks associated with imported merchandise  including fluctuations in the relative value of currencies  import duties  exchange controls  differing tax structures  trade restrictions  transportation costs  work stoppages  and general political and economic conditions in foreign countries 
any of those fluctuations could materially affect our operations and our ability to purchase imported vehicles and parts at competitive prices as compared to products manufactured in the us  which could materially adversely affect our business 

table of contents our investments in joint ventures subject us to additional business risks  including the potential for future impairment charges if the joint ventures do not perform as expected 
we have invested in a variety of joint ventures  including retail automotive operations in germany and a limited partnership interest in penske truck leasing ptl 
the net book value of our retail automotive joint venture investments  including ptl  was million  as of december  we expect to receive future operating distributions from our joint venture investments and to realize u 
s tax savings as a result of the investment in ptl 
these benefits may not be realized if the joint ventures do not perform as expected  or if changes in tax  financial or regulatory requirements  changes in the financial health of the joint venture customers  labor strikes or work stoppages  lower asset utilization rates or industry competition negatively impact the results of the joint venture operations 
in addition  if any of the businesses do not perform as expected  we may recognize an impairment charge which could be material and which could adversely affect our financial results for the periods in which any charge occurs 
we may write down the value of our goodwill or franchises which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and stockholders equity 
we have an aggregate of billion of goodwill and franchise value on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  these intangible assets are subject to impairment assessments at least annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred by applying a fair value based test 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million pre tax goodwill impairment charge and a million pre tax franchise value impairment charge 
if the growth assumptions embodied in our impairment tests prove inaccurate  we may incur incremental impairment charges 
in particular  a decline of or more in the estimated fair market value of our uk reporting unit would likely yield a significant write down of the goodwill attributable to our uk reporting unit 
the net book value of the goodwill attributable to the uk reporting unit as of december  is approximately million  a substantial portion of which would likely be written off if step one of the impairment test indicates impairment 
if we experienced such a decline in our other reporting units  we would not expect to incur significant goodwill impairment charges 
however  a reduction in the estimated fair value of our franchises would result in franchise value impairment charges of approximately million 
any such impairment charges could materially adversely affect our shareholders equity and other results of operations 
item b 
unresolved staff comments not applicable 
item properties we have historically structured our operations so as to minimize our ownership of real property 
as a result  we lease or sublease substantially all of our facilities 
these leases are generally for a period of between five and years  and are typically structured to include renewal options at our election 
we lease office space in bloomfield hills  michigan  leicester  england and stuttgart  germany for our administrative headquarters and other corporate related activities 
we believe that our facilities are sufficient for our needs and are in good repair 
item legal proceedings we are involved in litigation which may relate to claims brought by governmental authorities  issues with customers  and employment related matters  including class action claims and purported class action claims 
we are not a party to any legal proceedings  including class action lawsuits that  individually or in the aggregate  are reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
however  the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows

see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we are a holding company whose assets consist primarily of the direct or indirect ownership of the capital stock of our operating subsidiaries 
consequently  our ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute earnings and other advances and payments to us 
also  pursuant to the automobile franchise agreements to which our dealerships are subject  our dealerships are generally required to maintain a certain amount of working capital  which could limit our subsidiaries ability to pay us dividends

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed in item a 
risk factors and forward looking statements 
we have acquired and initiated a number of businesses since inception 
our financial statements include the results of operations of those businesses from the date acquired or when they commenced operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations has been updated to reflect the revision of our financial statements for entities which have been treated as discontinued operations through december  overview we are the second largest automotive retailer headquartered in the us as measured by total revenues 
as of december   we owned and operated franchises in the us and franchises outside of the us  primarily in the us we offer a full range of vehicle brands with of our total retail revenue in generated from brands of non us based manufacturers  and generated from premium brands  such as audi  bmw  cadillac and porsche 
each of our dealerships offers a wide selection of new and used vehicles for sale 
in addition to selling new and used vehicles  we generate higher margin revenue at each of our dealerships through maintenance and repair services and the sale and placement of higher margin products  such as third party finance and insurance products  third party extended service contracts and replacement and aftermarket automotive products 
we are also diversified geographically  with of our total revenues in generated by operations in the us and puerto rico and generated from our operations outside the us predominately in the us we are also  through smart usa distributor  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary  the exclusive distributor of the smart fortwo vehicle in the us and puerto rico 
the smart fortwo is manufactured by mercedes benz cars and is a daimler brand 
this technologically advanced vehicle achieves more than miles per gallon on the highway and is an ultra low emissions vehicle as certified by the state of california air resources board 
as of december   smart usa has certified a network of more than smart dealerships  nine of which are owned and operated by us 
the smart fortwo offers five different versions  the pure  passion coupe  passion cabriolet  brabus coupe and brabus cabriolet  with base prices ranging from  to  smart usa wholesaled  smart fortwo vehicles in and  smart fortwo vehicles in in june  we acquired a limited partnership interest in penske truck leasing co  lp ptl  a leading global transportation services provider  from subsidiaries of general electric capital corporation 
ptl operates and maintains more than  vehicles and serves customers in north america  south america  europe and asia 
product lines include full service leasing  contract maintenance  commercial and consumer truck rental and logistics services  including  transportation and distribution center management and supply chain management 
the general partner of ptl is penske truck leasing corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of penske corporation  which  together with other wholly owned subsidiaries of penske corporation  owns of ptl 
the remaining of ptl is owned by ge capital 
outlook during  there has been continued weakness in consumer confidence and spending in the markets in which we operate  which we believe has resulted in reduced customer traffic in our dealerships 
while we have experienced increased vehicle sales and customer traffic in recent quarters  we expect our business to remain significantly impacted by difficult economic conditions in operating overview new and used vehicle revenues include sales to retail customers and to leasing companies providing consumer automobile leasing 
we generate finance and insurance revenues from sales of third party extended service contracts  sales of third party insurance policies  fees for facilitating the sale of third party finance and lease contracts and the sale of certain other products 
service and parts revenues include fees paid for repair  maintenance and collision services  the sale of replacement parts and the sale of aftermarket accessories 
during  the challenging operating environment contributed to a year over year decline in same store new and used vehicle unit sales and finance and insurance revenues 
our same store service and parts business also experienced a decline during the year  although less so than vehicle sales 
we expect a continuation of this difficult operating environment in our gross profit tends to vary with the mix of revenues we derive from the sale of new vehicles  used vehicles  finance and insurance products  service and parts transactions  and the distribution of the smart fortwo 
our gross profit varies across product lines  with vehicle sales usually resulting in lower gross profit margins and our other revenues resulting in higher gross profit margins 
factors such as inventory and vehicle availability  customer demand  consumer confidence  unemployment  general economic conditions  seasonality  weather  credit availability  fuel prices and manufacturers advertising and incentives may impact the mix of our revenues  and therefore influence our gross profit margin 

table of contents our selling expenses consist of advertising and compensation for sales personnel  including commissions and related bonuses 
general and administrative expenses include compensation for administration  finance  legal and general management personnel  rent  insurance  utilities  and other outside services 
a significant portion of our selling expenses are variable  and we believe a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses are subject to our control  allowing us to adjust them over time to reflect economic trends 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for compensation and advertising have decreased in  due in part to lower vehicle sales volumes  coupled with cost savings in compensation and advertising 
our rent expense is expected to grow as a result of cost of living indexes outlined in our lease agreements  however  a portion of the rent increase has been offset by concessions granted by certain landlords in recognition of current market conditions 
floor plan interest expense relates to financing incurred in connection with the acquisition of new and used vehicle inventories that is secured by those vehicles 
other interest expense consists of interest charges on all of our interest bearing debt  other than interest relating to floor plan financing 
the cost of our variable rate indebtedness is typically based on benchmark lending rates  which are based in large part upon national inter bank lending rates set by local governments 
during the latter part of  such benchmark rates were significantly reduced due to government actions designed to spur liquidity and bank lending activities 
as a result  our cost of capital on variable rate indebtedness has declined during the year ended december   however  the significance of this decrease is limited somewhat by increases in rate spreads being charged by our vehicle finance partners 
equity in earnings of affiliates represents our share of the earnings relating to investments in joint ventures and other non consolidated investments  including ptl 
it is our expectation that the difficult operating conditions outlined above will similarly impact these businesses in the future success of our business will likely be dependent on  among other things  general economic and industry conditions  our ability to consummate and integrate acquisitions  our ability to increase sales of higher margin products  especially service and parts services  our ability to realize returns on our significant capital investment in new and upgraded dealerships  the success of our distribution of the smart fortwo  and the return realized from our investments in various joint ventures and other non consolidated investments 
see item a risk factors and forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of accounting policies that often involve making estimates and employing judgments 
such judgments influence the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses recognized in our financial statements 
management  on an ongoing basis  reviews these estimates and assumptions 
management may determine that modifications in assumptions and estimates are required  which may result in a material change in our results of operations or financial position 
the following are the accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements that management believes are most dependent upon the use of estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition vehicle  parts and service sales we record revenue when vehicles are delivered and title has passed to the customer  when vehicle service or repair work is completed and when parts are delivered to our customers 
sales promotions that we offer to customers are accounted for as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale 
rebates and other incentives offered directly to us by manufacturers are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales 
reimbursement of qualified advertising expenses are treated as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses 
the amounts received under certain manufacturer rebate and incentive programs are based on the attainment of program objectives  and such earnings are recognized either upon the sale of the vehicle for which the award was received  or upon attainment of the particular program goals if not associated with individual vehicles 
during the years ended december   and  we earned million  million and million  respectively  of rebates  incentives and reimbursements from manufacturers  of which million  million and million was recorded as a reduction of cost of sales 

table of contents finance and insurance sales subsequent to the sale of a vehicle to a customer  we sell our installment sale contracts to various financial institutions on a non recourse basis with specified exceptions to mitigate the risk of default 
we receive a commission from the lender equal to either the difference between the interest rate charged to the customer and the interest rate set by the financing institution or a flat fee 
we also receive commissions for facilitating the sale of various third party insurance products to customers  including credit and life insurance policies and extended service contracts 
these commissions are recorded as revenue at the time the customer enters into the contract 
impairment testing franchise value impairment is assessed as of october every year and upon the occurrence of an indicator of impairment through a comparison of its carrying amount and estimated fair value 
an indicator of impairment exists if the carrying value of a franchise exceeds its estimated fair value and an impairment loss may be recognized up to that excess 
the fair value of franchise value is determined using a discounted cash flow approach  which includes assumptions that include revenue and profitability growth  franchise profit margins  and our cost of capital 
we also evaluate our franchise agreements in connection with the annual impairment testing to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support our assessment that the franchise agreements have an indefinite life 
goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level as of october every year and upon the occurrence of an indicator of impairment 
we have determined that the dealerships in each of our operating segments within the retail reportable segment  which are organized by geography  are components that are aggregated into five reporting units as they a have similar economic characteristics all are automotive dealerships having similar margins  b offer similar products and services all sell new and used vehicles  service  parts and third party finance and insurance products  c have similar target markets and customers generally individuals and d have similar distribution and marketing practices all distribute products and services through dealership facilities that market to customers in similar fashions 
accordingly  our operating segments are also considered our reporting units for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing relating to our retail reportable segment 
there is no goodwill recorded in our distribution or pag investments reportable segments 
an indicator of goodwill impairment exists if the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill  is determined to exceed the estimated fair value 
the fair value of goodwill is determined using a discounted cash flow approach  which includes assumptions that include revenue and profitability growth  franchise profit margins  residual values and our cost of capital 
if an indication of goodwill impairment exists  an analysis reflecting the allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to all assets and liabilities  including previously unrecognized intangible assets  is performed 
the impairment is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with its carrying amount and an impairment loss may be recognized up to that excess 
investments in  investments included investments in businesses accounted for under the equity method 
in and  investments also included marketable securities 
a majority of our investments are in joint venture relationships that are more fully described in joint venture relationships below 
such joint venture relationships are accounted for under the equity method  pursuant to which we record our proportionate share of the joint ventures income each period 
in december  we exited from our joint venture investment in mexico and in june  we acquired a limited partnership interest in ptl for million from ge capital 
the net book value of our investments was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
investments for which there is not a liquid  actively traded market are reviewed periodically by management for indicators of impairment 
if an indicator of impairment is identified  management estimates the fair value of the investment using a discounted cash flow approach  which includes assumptions relating to revenue and profitability growth  profit margins  residual values and our cost of capital 
declines in investment values that are deemed to be other than temporary may result in an impairment charge reducing the investments carrying value to fair value 
self insurance we retain risk relating to certain of our general liability insurance  workers compensation insurance  auto physical damage insurance  property insurance  employment practices liability insurance  directors and officers insurance  and employee medical benefits in the us as a result  we are likely to be responsible for a significant portion of the claims and losses incurred under these programs 
the amount of risk we retain varies by program  and  for certain exposures  we have pre determined maximum loss limits for certain individual claims and or insurance periods 
losses  if any  above the pre determined loss limits are paid by third party insurance carriers 
our estimate of future losses is prepared by management using our historical loss experience and industry based development factors 
aggregate reserves relating to retained risk were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
changes in the reserve estimate during relate primarily to the inclusion of additional participants in our self insured employee medical benefit plans and reserves for current year activity in our general liability and workers compensation programs 

table of contents income taxes tax regulations may require items to be included in our tax return at different times than those items are reflected in our financial statements 
some of the differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return  and some are temporary differences  such as the timing of depreciation expense 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that will be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years which we have already recorded in our financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent deductions taken on our tax return that have not yet been recognized as expense in our financial statements 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to allow for the use of the deduction or credit 
a valuation allowance of million has been recorded relating to net operating losses and credit carryforwards in the us based on our determination that it is more likely than not that they will not be utilized 
classification of franchises in continuing and discontinued operations we classify the results of our operations in our consolidated financial statements based on general accounting principles for discontinued operations  which requires judgment in determining whether a franchise will be reported within continuing or discontinued operations 
such judgments include whether a franchise will be divested  the period required to complete the divestiture  and the likelihood of changes to the divestiture plans 
if we determine that a franchise should be reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations  or from discontinued operations to continuing operations  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods are revised to reflect such reclassification 
new accounting pronouncement a new accounting pronouncement amending the consolidation guidance relating to variable interest entities vie became effective for us on january  the new guidance replaces the current quantitative model for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity with a qualitative approach that considers which entity has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the variable interest entity s performance and whether the entity has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
the new guidance also requires an additional reconsideration event for determining whether an entity is a vie when holders of an at risk equity investment lose voting or similar rights to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities economic performance  ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  separate presentation of the assets and liabilities of the vie on the balance sheet  and additional disclosures about an entity s involvement with a vie 
the adoption of the accounting pronouncement will not impact our consolidated financial statements

historically  these cash requirements have been met through cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit agreements and floor plan arrangements  the issuance of debt securities  sale leaseback transactions  mortgages  or the issuance of equity securities 
as discussed in more detail below  we have currently outstanding million million on december  in senior subordinated convertible notes 
we currently expect to be required to redeem these notes in april if we do not otherwise refinance them prior to april as of december   we had working capital of million  including million of cash  available to fund our operations and capital commitments 
in addition  we had million and million million available for borrowing under our us credit agreement and our us credit agreement  respectively  each of which is discussed below 
we have historically expanded our retail automotive operations through organic growth and the acquisition of retail automotive dealerships 
in addition  one of our subsidiaries is the exclusive distributor of smart fortwo vehicles in the us and puerto rico 
we believe that cash flow from operations and our existing capital resources  including the liquidity provided by our credit agreements and floor plan financing arrangements  will be sufficient to fund our operations and commitments for at least the next twelve months 
to the extent we pursue additional significant acquisitions  other expansion opportunities  significant repurchases of our outstanding securities  or refinance or repay existing debt including our senior subordinated convertible notes  we may need to raise additional capital either through the public or private issuance of equity or debt securities or through additional borrowings  which sources of funds may not necessarily be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  our liquidity could be negatively impacted in the event we fail to comply with the covenants under our various financing and operating agreements or in the event our floor plan financing is withdrawn

under this new program  we may  from time to time as market conditions warrant  purchase our outstanding common stock  debt or convertible debt on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions and  potentially  via a tender offer or a pre arranged trading plan 
we have historically funded repurchases through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our us credit facility 
the decision to make repurchases will be based on factors such as the market price of the relevant security versus our view of its intrinsic value  the potential impact of such repurchases on our capital structure  and alternative uses of capital  such as for strategic investments in our current business  as well as any then existing limits imposed by our finance agreements and securities trading policy 
we paid the following dividends in and per share dividends first quarter first quarter second quarter second quarter third quarter third quarter fourth quarter fourth quarter in february  we announced the suspension of our quarterly cash dividend 
future quarterly or other cash dividends will depend upon our earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  restrictions on any then existing indebtedness and other factors considered relevant by our board of directors

upon conversion of the convertible notes  for each  principal amount of the convertible notes  a holder will receive an amount in cash  equal to the lesser of i  or ii the conversion value  determined in the manner set forth in the indenture covering the convertible notes  of the number of shares of common stock equal to the conversion rate 
if the conversion value exceeds  we will also deliver  at our election  cash  common stock or a combination of cash and common stock with respect to the remaining value deliverable upon conversion 

table of contents in the event of a conversion due to a change of control on or before april   we will  in certain circumstances  pay a make whole premium by increasing the conversion rate used in that conversion 
in addition  we will pay additional cash interest commencing with six month periods beginning on april   if the average trading price of a convertible note for certain periods in the prior six month period equals or more of the principal amount of the convertible notes 
on or after april   we may redeem the convertible notes  in whole at any time or in part from time to time  for cash at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be redeemed  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date 
holders of the convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their convertible notes for cash on each of april   april  or april  at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be purchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the applicable purchase date 
because of this feature  we currently expect to be required to redeem the convertible notes in april or otherwise refinance the notes on or prior thereto 
see item a risk factors  including if we are unable to refinance or repay our senior subordinated convertible notes in april  our overall liquidity position may be materially adversely affected 
in march  we repurchased million principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes  which had a book value  net of debt discount  of million for million 
in connection with the transaction  we wrote off million of unamortized debt discount and million of unamortized deferred financing costs  and incurred million of transaction costs 
no element of the consideration was allocated to the reacquisition of the equity component because the consideration paid was less than the fair value of the liability component prior to extinguishment 
as a result  we recorded a million pre tax gain in connection with the repurchase 
in february  we repurchased million principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes for million 
mortgage facilities we are party to a million mortgage facility with respect to certain of our dealership properties that matures on october  the facility bears interest at a defined rate  requires monthly principal and interest payments  and includes the option to extend the term for successive periods of five years up to a maximum term of twenty five years 
in the event we exercise our options to extend the term  the interest rate will be renegotiated at each renewal period 
the mortgage facility also contains typical events of default  including non payment of obligations  cross defaults to our other material indebtedness  certain change of control events  and the loss or sale of certain franchises operated at the property 
substantially all of the buildings  improvements  fixtures and personal property of the properties under the mortgage facility are subject to security interests granted to the lender 
as of december   million was outstanding under this facility 
senior subordinated notes in march  we redeemed our outstanding million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes 
we incurred an million pre tax charge in connection with the redemption  consisting of a million redemption premium and the write off of million of unamortized deferred financing costs 
interest rate swaps we use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our variable rate floor plan debt 
we are party to interest rate swap agreements through january  pursuant to which the libor portion of million of our floating rate floor plan debt was fixed at 
we may terminate these arrangements at any time  subject to the settlement of the then current fair value of the swap arrangements 
prior to the third quarter of  the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges of future interest payments of libor based us floor plan borrowings and the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative was reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affected earnings 
during the quarter ended september   we experienced declines in outstanding floor plan debt balances related to certain floor plan lenders due to significant declines in vehicle inventory levels which caused hedged floor plan balances to fall below the notional value of the swap agreements 
we elected to de designate these cash flow hedges on september   and  as a result  recorded a net loss of million in floor plan interest expense 

table of contents we re designated million of the interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges of future interest payments of libor based us floor plan borrowings and the effective portion of the gain or loss on that million of the swap agreements is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 
future settlements and changes in the fair value related to the undesignated million of the swap agreements will be recorded as realized and unrealized gains losses within interest expense 
as of december   we used level inputs to estimate the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements designated as hedging instruments to be a liability of million  of which million and million are recorded in accrued expenses and other long term liabilities  respectively 
we used level inputs to estimate the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements not designated as hedging instruments as of december  to be a liability of million  which is recorded in accrued expenses 
during the year ended december   we recognized a net gain of million related to the effective portion of the interest rate swap agreements designated as hedging instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income  and reclassified million of the existing derivative losses  including the million loss on de designation  from accumulated other comprehensive income into floor plan interest expense 
we expect approximately million associated with the swaps to be recognized as an increase of interest expense over the next twelve months as the hedged interest payments become due 
during the year ended december   the swaps increased the weighted average interest rate on our floor plan borrowings by approximately 
ptl dividends we own a limited partnership interest in penske truck leasing 
in and we received million and million of pro rata cash dividends from this investment 
we currently expect to continue to receive future dividends from ptl depending on their operating performance 
operating leases we have historically structured our operations so as to minimize our ownership of real property 
as a result  we lease or sublease substantially all of our facilities 
these leases are generally for a period of between five and years  and are typically structured to include renewal options at our election 
we estimate our total rent obligations under these leases including any extension periods we may exercise at our discretion and assuming constant consumer price indices to be billion 
pursuant to the leases for some of our larger facilities  we are required to comply with specified financial ratios  including a rent coverage ratio and a debt to ebitda ratio  each as defined 
for these leases  non compliance with the ratios may require us to post collateral in the form of a letter of credit 
a breach of our other lease covenants would give rise to certain remedies by the landlord  the most severe of which include the termination of the applicable lease and acceleration of the total rent payments due under the lease 
sale leaseback arrangements we have in the past and expect in the future to enter into sale leaseback transactions to finance certain property acquisitions and capital expenditures  pursuant to which we sell property and or leasehold improvements to third parties and agree to lease those assets back for a certain period of time 
such sales generate proceeds which vary from period to period 
in light of the current market conditions  this financing option has become more expensive and thus we may utilize these arrangements less in the near term 
off balance sheet arrangements we have sold a number of dealerships to third parties and  as a condition to certain of those sales  remain liable for the lease payments relating to the properties on which those businesses operate in the event of non payment by the buyer 
we are also party to lease agreements on properties that we no longer use in our retail operations that we have sublet to third parties 
we rely on subtenants to pay the rent and maintain the property at these locations 
in the event the subtenant does not perform as expected  we may not be able to recover amounts owed to us and we could be required to fulfill these obligations 
the aggregate rent paid by the tenants on those properties in was approximately million  and  in aggregate  we guarantee or are otherwise liable for approximately million of lease payments  including lease payments during available renewal periods 
smart usa we are subject to purchase commitments pursuant to the smart distribution agreement  which requires us to purchase a number of vehicles to be negotiated on an ongoing basis 
in addition  we are potentially subject to a purchase commitment with respect to unsold inventories and other items pursuant to the smart franchise agreement and state franchise laws in the event of franchise terminations

cash flows from continuing operating activities includes net income  as adjusted for non cash items and the effects of changes in working capital 
we finance substantially all of our new and a portion of our used vehicle inventories under revolving floor plan notes payable with various lenders 
we retain the right to select which  if any  financing source to utilize in connection with the procurement of vehicle inventories 
many vehicle manufacturers provide vehicle financing for the dealers representing their brands  however  it is not a requirement that we utilize this financing 
historically  our floor plan finance source has been based on aggregate pricing considerations 
in accordance with general accounting principles relating to the statement of cash flows  we report all cash flows arising in connection with floor plan notes payable with the manufacturer of a particular new vehicle as an operating activity in our statement of cash flows  and all cash flows arising in connection with floor plan notes payable to a party other than the manufacturer of a particular new vehicle and all floor plan notes payable relating to pre owned vehicles as a financing activity in our statement of cash flows 
currently  the majority of our non trade vehicle financing is with other manufacturer captive lenders 
to date  we have not experienced any material limitation with respect to the amount or availability of financing from any institution providing us vehicle financing 
we believe that changes in aggregate floor plan liabilities are typically linked to changes in vehicle inventory and  therefore  are an integral part of understanding changes in our working capital and operating cash flow 
as a result  we have presented the following reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities as reported in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows as if all changes in vehicle floor plan were classified as an operating activity for informational purposes year ended december  net cash from continuing operating activities as reported floor plan notes payable non trade as reported net cash from continuing operating activities including all floor plan notes payable cash flows from continuing investing activities cash used in continuing investing activities was million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively

capital expenditures relate primarily to improvements to our existing dealership facilities and the construction of new facilities 
as of december   we do not have material commitments related to our planned or ongoing capital projects

no cash dividends were paid to our stockholders during the year ended december  cash flows from discontinued operations cash flows relating to discontinued operations are not currently considered  nor are they expected to be  material to our liquidity or our capital resources 
management does not believe that there are any material past  present or upcoming cash transactions relating to discontinued operations 
contractual payment obligations the table below sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of future payments relating to our most significant contractual obligations as of december   except as otherwise noted 
the information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based upon  among other things  the terms of any relevant agreements 
future events  including acquisitions  divestitures  new or revised operating lease agreements  borrowings or repayments under our credit agreements and our floor plan arrangements  and purchases or refinancing of our securities  could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts 
less than more than total year to years to years years floorplan notes payable a long term debt obligations b operating lease commitments scheduled interest payments b c other liabilities d a floor plan notes payable are revolving financing arrangements 
payments are generally made as required pursuant to the floor plan borrowing agreements discussed above under inventory financing 
b interest and principal repayments under our million of senior subordinated notes due are reflected in the table above 
while these notes are not due until  the holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash in this acceleration of ultimate repayment is reflected in the table above 
in addition  we repurchased million of the senior subordinated notes in february  which repurchase is not reflected in this table 
c estimates of future variable rate interest payments under floorplan notes payable and our credit agreements are excluded due to our inability to estimate changes to interest rates in the future 
see inventory financing  us credit agreement  and us credit agreement above for a discussion of such variable rates 
d includes uncertain tax positions and our purchase commitments pursuant to our smart distribution and franchise agreements 
due to the subjective nature of our uncertain tax positions  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of payments arising in connection with the unrecognized tax benefits  however  as a result of the statute of limitations  we do not expect any of these payments to occur in more than years 
we have thus classified this as to years 
exposure related to our purchase commitments on known smart usa dealer franchise terminations have been classified as less than year 

table of contents we expect that  other than for scheduled payments upon the maturity or termination dates of certain of our debt instruments  the amounts above will be funded through cash flow from operations 
in the case of payments upon the maturity or termination dates of our debt instruments  we currently expect to be able to refinance such instruments in the normal course of business or otherwise fund them from cash flows from operations

cyclicality unit sales of motor vehicles  particularly new vehicles  historically have been cyclical  fluctuating with general economic cycles 
during economic downturns  the automotive retailing industry tends to experience periods of decline and recession similar to those experienced by the general economy 
we believe that the industry is influenced by general economic conditions and particularly by consumer confidence  the level of personal discretionary spending  fuel prices  interest rates and credit availability 
seasonality our business is modestly seasonal overall 
our us operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
also  vehicle demand  and to a lesser extent demand for service and parts  is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the us where dealerships may be subject to severe winters 
our us operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the first and third quarters of each year  due primarily to vehicle registration practices in the uk effects of inflation we believe that inflation rates over the last few years have not had a significant impact on revenues or profitability 
we do not expect inflation to have any near term material effects on the sale of our products and services  however  we cannot be sure there will be no such effect in the future 
we finance substantially all of our inventory through various revolving floor plan arrangements with interest rates that vary based on various benchmarks 
such rates have historically increased during periods of increasing inflation

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on a significant portion of our outstanding debt 
outstanding revolving balances under our credit agreements bear interest at variable rates based on a margin over defined libor or the bank of england base rate 
based on the amount outstanding under these facilities as of december   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our annual other interest expense 
similarly  amounts outstanding under our floor plan financing arrangements bear interest at a variable rate based on a margin over the prime rate  defined libor  the finance house base rate  or the euro interbank offer rate 
we are currently party to swap agreements pursuant to which a notional million of our floating rate floor plan debt was exchanged for fixed rate debt through january based on an average of the aggregate amounts outstanding under our floor plan financing arrangements subject to variable interest payments  adjusted to exclude the notional value of the hedged swap agreements  during the year ended december   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our annual floor plan interest expense 
we evaluate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and follow established policies and procedures to implement strategies designed to manage the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding at any point in time in an effort to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows 
these policies include the maintenance of our overall debt portfolio with targeted fixed and variable rate components  the use of authorized derivative instruments  the prohibition of using derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes  and the prohibition of highly leveraged derivatives or derivatives which we are unable to reliably value or for which we are unable to obtain a market quotation 
interest rate fluctuations affect the fair market value of our fixed rate debt  including our swaps  the notes  the convertible notes and certain seller financed promissory notes  but  with respect to such fixed rate debt instruments  do not impact our earnings and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   we had dealership operations in the uk and germany 
in each of these markets  the local currency is the functional currency 
due to our intent to remain permanently invested in these foreign markets  we do not hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
in the event we change our intent with respect to the investment in any of our international operations  we would expect to implement strategies designed to manage those risks in an effort to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows 
a ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the us dollar would have resulted in an approximate million change to our revenues for the year ended december  in common with other automotive retailers  we purchase certain of our new vehicle and parts inventories from foreign manufacturers 
although we purchase the majority of our inventories in the local functional currency  our business is subject to certain risks  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility which may influence such manufacturers ability to provide their products at competitive prices in the local jurisdictions 
our future results could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors
