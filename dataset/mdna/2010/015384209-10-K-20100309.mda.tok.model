item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based upon current expectations 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  intend  potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a pharmaceutical company focused on the research  development  and commercialization of novel proprietary products for the acute treatment of central nervous system  or cns  conditions 
all of our product candidates are based on our proprietary technology  the staccato system 
the staccato system vaporizes an excipient free drug to form a condensation aerosol that  when inhaled  allows for rapid systemic drug delivery 
because of the particle size of the aerosol  the drug is quickly absorbed through the deep lung into the bloodstream  providing speed of therapeutic onset that is comparable to intravenous  or iv  administration but with greater ease  patient comfort and convenience 
in december  we submitted our first new drug application  or nda  to the us food and drug administration  or fda  for our lead product candidate  az in february  we licensed the us and canadian commercialization rights to az to biovail laboratories international srl 
we plan to seek additional commercial partners for az outside of the us and canada 
we have five other product candidates in various stages of clinical development  ranging from phase through late stage phase in january we reduced  and in some cases suspended  the development of these product 
table of contents candidates in order to concentrate our efforts on the clinical  regulatory  manufacturing and commercial development of our lead product candidate 
during the first half of  we expect to conduct a review of our product candidate portfolio 
in the second half of  we plan to advance the development of at least one of these product candidates 
we are seeking partners to support continued development of these product candidates  but may develop one or more of these product candidates without partner support 
our clinical stage product candidates are az staccato loxapine 
we are developing az for the rapid treatment of agitation in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder 
in december  we submitted our nda to the fda 
in february  the fda accepted our filing and provided us a prescription drug user fee act pdufa goal date of october  we believe that the data generated from our clinical and non clinical studies and contained within our nda submission adequately demonstrate the efficacy and safety of az for the rapid treatment of agitation in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder 
in february  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement  or license agreement  and a manufacture and supply agreement  collectively  the collaboration  with biovail laboratories international srl  or biovail  for az staccato loxapine for the treatment of psychiatric and or neurological indications and the symptoms associated with these indications  including the initial indication of treating agitation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients 
the collaboration contemplates that we will be the exclusive supplier of drug product for clinical and commercial uses and have responsibility for the nda for az for the initial indication of rapid treatment of agitation in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder  as well as responsibility for any additional development and regulatory activities required for use in these two patient populations in the outpatient setting 
biovail will be responsible for commercialization for the initial indication and  if it elects  development and commercialization of additional indications for az in the us and canada 
under the terms of the license agreement  biovail paid us an upfront fee of million  and we may be eligible to receive up to an additional million in milestone payments upon achievement of predetermined regulatory  clinical and commercial manufacturing milestones 
we may be subject to certain payment obligation to biovail  up to million  if we do not meet certain other milestones prior to a termination of the license agreement 
we are also eligible to receive tiered royalty payments of to on any net sales of az we are responsible for conducting and funding all development and regulatory activities associated with az s initial indication for the rapid treatment of agitation in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder as well as for its possible use in the outpatient setting in these two patient populations 
our obligation to fund the outpatient development efforts is limited to a specified amount  none of which is expected to be incurred in biovail is responsible for certain phase development commitments and related costs and expenses 
for additional indications  we have an obligation regarding certain efforts and related costs and expenses  up to a specified amount  and  if it elects  biovail is responsible for all other development commitments and related costs and expenses 
under the terms of the manufacture and supply agreement  we are the exclusive supplier of az and have responsibility for the manufacture  packaging  labeling and supply for clinical and commercial uses 
biovail will purchase az from us at predetermined transfer prices 
the transfer prices depend on the volume of az purchases  subject to certain adjustments 
either party may terminate the collaboration for the other party s uncured material breach or bankruptcy 
in addition  biovail has the right to terminate the collaboration a upon days written notice for convenience  b upon days written notice if fda does not approve the az nda for the initial indication for the rapid treatment of agitation in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder  c immediately upon written notice for safety reasons or withdrawal of marketing approval  d upon days written notice upon certain recalls of the product  or e immediately upon written notice within days of termination of the supply agreement under certain circumstances 
the supply agreement automatically terminates upon the termination of the license agreement 

table of contents az staccato zaleplon 
we are developing az for the treatment of insomnia in patients who have difficulty falling asleep  including patients who awake in the middle of the night and have difficulty falling back asleep 
az has completed phase testing 
in the phase study  az delivered an iv like pharmacokinetic profile with a median time to peak drug concentration of minutes 
pharmacodynamics  measured as sedation assessed on a mm visual analog scale  showed onset of effect as early as minutes after dosing 
az staccato prochlorperazine 
we are developing az to treat patients suffering from acute migraine headaches 
during the third quarter of  we conducted an end of phase meeting with the fda 
we believe we have a clear understanding of the development requirements for filing an nda for this product candidate 
az staccato loxapine  low dose 
we are developing az to treat patients suffering from acute migraine headaches 
az staccato alprazolam 
az has completed a phase clinical trial in healthy subjects and a phase a proof of concept clinical trial in panic disorder patients for the treatment of panic attacks  an indication we are not planning to pursue 
however  given the safety profile  the successful and reproducible delivery of alprazolam  and the iv like pharmacological effect demonstrated to date  we are assessing az for other possible indications and renewed clinical development 
az staccato fentanyl 
we are developing az for the treatment of patients with acute pain  including patients with breakthrough cancer pain and postoperative patients with acute pain episodes 
we have completed and announced positive results from a phase clinical trial of az in opioid na ve healthy subjects 
in december  we entered into a transaction involving a series of related agreements providing for the financing of additional clinical and nonclinical development of az  staccato alprazolam  and az az  staccato loxapine 
pursuant to the agreements  symphony capital llc and other investors  which we refer to collectively as the allegro investors  invested million to form symphony allegro  inc  or symphony allegro  to fund additional clinical and nonclinical development of staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine 
we exclusively licensed to symphony allegro certain intellectual property rights related to staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine 
we retained manufacturing rights to these product candidates 
in august  we completed the acquisition of symphony allegro through the exercise of an option to acquire all of the outstanding equity of symphony allegro  as amended in june in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of symphony allegro  we i issued to the allegro investors million shares of common stock  ii issued to the allegro investors five year warrants to purchase million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share and canceled the previously outstanding warrants to purchase million shares of common stock held by the allegro investors  and iii agreed to pay certain percentages of cash payments that may be generated from future partnering transactions for az  az and or az  the product candidates that were licensed to symphony allegro 
in february  we paid symphony million of the total proceeds that were received from biovail pursuant to the license and supply agreement 
in addition  symphony will be entitled to receive a portion of future milestone and royalty payments we may receive from biovail pursuant to this agreement 
other than those licensed to biovail  we have retained all rights to our product candidates and the staccato system 
we eventually plan to build a united states based specialty sales force to commercialize our product candidates which are approved for marketing and which are intended for specialty pharmaceutical markets 
we plan to enter into strategic partnerships with other companies to commercialize products that are intended for certain markets in the united states and for all of our product candidates in geographic territories outside the united states 
we were incorporated december  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  capital lease and equipment financings and government grants 
we have generated million in revenues from inception through december   through united states small business innovation research grants and drug compound feasibility studies and million from the license and development agreement with endo 
prior to  we recognized governmental grant revenue and drug compound feasibility revenue  however  we expect no grant revenue or drug compound feasibility screening revenue in in january  we and endo 
table of contents mutually terminated the license agreement  at which time we fulfilled our obligations under the agreement  and we recognized the remaining million of deferred revenues into revenues in the first quarter of we do not expect any material product revenue until at least on october   we issued a total of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to an additional  shares of our common stock in a private placement 
these securities were sold as units with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at a purchase price of per unit 
the net proceeds  after deducting the payment of a placement agent fee  and other offering expenses  were approximately million 
the warrants issued are cash or net exercisable for a period of seven years from october  and have an exercise price of per share 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our deficit accumulated during development stage was million and total stockholders deficit was million 
we recognized net losses of million  million  million and million in  and  and the period from december  inception to december   respectively 
in january  we consolidated our operations to primarily focus our efforts on the continued rapid development of az we expect our net losses to continue  however we expect a decreases in operating expenses in as compared to due to our decreased clinical activity 
the process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
we consider the development of our product candidates to be crucial to our long term success 
if we do not complete development of our product candidates and obtain regulatory approval to market one or more of these product candidates  we may be forced to cease operations 
the probability of success for each product candidate may be impacted by numerous factors  including preclinical data  clinical data  competition  device development  manufacturing capability  regulatory approval and commercial viability 
our strategy is to focus our resources on az in february  the fda accepted  for filing  the nda that we submitted in december for this product candidate 
we have announced that we are seeking partnerships to continue development of our other programs 
if in the future we enter into additional partnerships  third parties could have control over preclinical development or clinical trials for some of our product candidates 
accordingly  the progress of such product candidate would not be under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates  if any  will be subject to any future partnerships or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments  and the risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent  we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
while we are currently focused on developing our product candidates  we anticipate that we and our partners  will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment as to the product candidate s commercial potential 
we do not expect any of our current product candidates to be commercially available before  if at all 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant estimates and judgments in preparation of our financial statements 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals we estimate our preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on our estimates of the services received pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
preclinical study and clinical trial expenses include the following fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical studies  fees paid to contract research organizations and other clinical sites in connection with clinical trials  and fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of components and drug materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we record accruals for these preclinical study and clinical trial costs based upon the estimated amount of work completed 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses based on these estimates 
costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are entered in the trial 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence and discussions with research institutions and organizations 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate or overestimate activity levels associated with various preclinical studies and clinical trials at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
to date  we have not made any material adjustments to our estimates of preclinical study and clinical trial costs 
we make good faith estimates which we believe to be accurate  but the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain  subject to risk and may change depending upon a number of factors  including our clinical development plan 
share based compensation our share based compensation expense includes a compensation cost for share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  related to i employees  based on the awards grant date intrinsic value  and ii non employees using the awards fair value  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted or modified subsequent to december   based on the awards grant date fair value 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and purchase rights issued under the employee stock purchase plan 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards is calculated based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant  reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting of the restricted stock unit 
our current estimate assumes no dividends will be paid prior to the vesting of the restricted stock unit 
we estimate the expected term of options based on the historical term periods of options that have been granted but are no longer outstanding and the estimated terms of outstanding options 
we estimate the volatility of our stock based on our actual historical volatility since our initial public offering 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 

table of contents we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the expenses in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating loss  net loss and net loss per share 
symphony allegro  inc on december  we entered into a transaction involving a series of related agreements with symphony capital llc  or symphony capital  symphony allegro holdings llc  or holdings  and holdings wholly owned subsidiary symphony allegro  to fund the clinical development of az  staccato alprazolam  and az  staccato loxapine  or the programs 
symphony capital and other investors  which we refer to collectively as the allegro investors  invested million in holdings  which then invested the million in symphony allegro 
pursuant to the agreements  symphony allegro agreed to invest up to the full million to fund the clinical development of the programs  and we licensed to symphony allegro certain intellectual property rights related to these programs 
we retained manufacturing rights to these product candidates 
pursuant to the agreements  we continued to be primarily responsible for all preclinical  clinical and device development efforts as well as maintenance of the intellectual property portfolio for the programs 
we and symphony allegro had established a development committee to oversee the programs 
we participated in the development committee and had the right to appoint one of the five board of director seats of symphony allegro 
pursuant to the agreements  we had received an exclusive purchase option  or the purchase option  that gave us the right  but not the obligation  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the outstanding equity of symphony allegro  and reacquire the intellectual property rights that we licensed to symphony allegro at certain fixed prices 
in consideration for the purchase option  we issued to holdings a five year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share and paid million for structuring fees and related expenses to symphony capital 
prior to the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of symphony allegro pursuant to the amended purchase option on august   as described below  we had concluded that symphony allegro was by design a variable interest entity  or vie 
because we had a purchase option to acquire its outstanding voting stock at prices that were fixed based upon the date the option is exercised 
the fixed nature of the purchase option price limited the returns of the allegro investors  as the investors in symphony allegro 
parties to an arrangement are deemed to be de facto agents if they cannot sell  transfer  or encumber their interests without the prior approval of an enterprise 
symphony capital was considered to be a de facto agent of ours pursuant to this provision  and because we and the allegro investors  as a related party group  absorbed a majority of symphony allegro s variability  we evaluated whether we are most closely associated with symphony allegro 
we concluded that we were most closely associated with symphony allegro and should consolidate symphony allegro because i we originally developed the technology that was assigned to symphony allegro  ii we continued to oversee and monitor the development program  iii our employees continued to perform substantially all of the development work  iv we significantly influenced the design of the responsibilities and corporate structure of symphony allegro  v symphony allegro s operations were substantially similar to our activities  and vi through the purchase option  we had the ability to meaningfully participate in the benefits of a successful development effort 
the allegro investors were required to absorb the development risk for their equity investment in symphony allegro 
the allegro investors equity investment in symphony allegro was classified as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheets 
the noncontrolling interest held by the allegro investors was reduced by the million fair value of the warrants they received in consideration for the purchase option and million of fees we immediately paid to symphony capital upon the transaction s closing because the total consideration provided by us to the allegro investors effectively reduced the allegro investors at risk equity investment in symphony allegro 
while we performed the research and development on behalf of symphony allegro  our development risk is limited to the consideration we provided to the allegro investors the warrants and fees 

table of contents net losses incurred by symphony allegro and charged to the noncontrolling interest were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we ceased to charge net losses incurred by symphony allegro against the noncontrolling interest upon our acquisition of symphony allegro on august  in december  the fasb issued new guidance that required i noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries be reported as a component of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet  ii noncontrolling interests continue to be attributed its share of losses even if that attribution results in a deficit noncontrolling interest balance  iii that earnings or losses attributed to the noncontrolling interests be reported as part of consolidated earnings and not as a separate component of income or expense  and iv disclosure of the attribution of consolidated earnings to the controlling and noncontrolling interests on the face of the consolidated statement of operations 
on january   we adopted these provisions 
had the previous requirements been applied  the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in symphony allegro would have decreased by million during the year ended december  in june  we entered into an agreement with holdings to modify the provisions of and to exercise the purchase option 
we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of symphony allegro pursuant to the amended purchase option on august  in exchange for all of the outstanding equity of symphony allegro  we i issued to the allegro investors million shares of common stock  ii issued to the allegro investors year warrants to purchase million shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share  and iii will pay holdings certain percentages of cash payments that may be generated from future partnering transactions for the programs 
the outstanding warrants to purchase million shares of common stock held by the allegro investors were cancelled 
we recorded the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of symphony allegro pursuant to the amended purchase option as a return of equity to the noncontrolling interest 
the acquisition was accounted for as a capital transaction that did not affect our net loss 
however  because the acquisition was accounted for as a capital transaction  the excess consideration transferred over the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in symphony allegro was treated as a deemed dividend for purposes of reporting net loss per share  increasing net loss per share attributable to alexza stockholders during the year ended december  the following table outlines the estimated fair value of consideration transferred by us and the computation of the excess consideration transferred over the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in symphony allegro in thousands description fair value fair value of consideration transferred  shares of alexza common stock warrant consideration  net contingent cash payments to symphony allegro stockholders total consideration transferred add deficit of noncontrolling interest in symphony allegro excess consideration transferred over the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in allegro the fair value of the alexza common stock was based on the closing sales price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on august   the date the transaction was completed 
the estimated fair values of the warrant consideration were calculated using the black scholes valuation model 
we estimated the fair value of the liability associated with the contingent cash payments to the symphony allegro stockholders  or contingent consideration liability  using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model 
we derived multiple cash flow scenarios for each of the product candidates subject to the cash payments and applied a probability to each of the scenarios 
these cash flows were then discounted at an rate 

table of contents changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability subsequent to the august  acquisition date are recognized in earnings in the period of the change 
certain events including  but not limited to  clinical trial results  fda approval or rejection of its submissions  such as our nda filed in december  the timing and terms of a strategic partnership  the commercial success of the programs  and the discount rate used could have a material impact on the fair value of the contingent consideration liability  and as a result  our results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revision of topic or sab in determining the accounting for collaboration agreements  we determine whether an arrangement involves multiple revenue generating deliverables that should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting or divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and  if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
if the arrangement represents a single unit of accounting  the revenue recognition policy and the performance obligation period must be determined  if not already contractually defined  for the entire arrangement 
if the arrangement represents separate units of accounting  a revenue recognition policy must be determined for each unit 
revenues for non refundable upfront license fee payments  where we continue to have obligations  will be recognized as performance occurs and obligations are completed 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
we had  and  of revenues in and  respectively 
in the third quarter of  we began to recognize revenues related to our endo license agreement 
in january  we mutually agreed with endo to terminate the license agreement  at which time we fulfilled our obligations under the license agreement and recognized the remaining million of deferred revenues into revenues in operating expenses our operating expenses were affected by our prospective method of adoption fair value accounting for employee share based compensation 
as a result  we believe reviewing our operating expenses both inclusive and exclusive of share based compensation provides a better understanding of the growth of our operations 
the impact of share based compensation on operating expenses is outlined as follows in thousands year ended december  non share based compensation expenses research and development general and administrative restructuring charges total non share based compensation expenses share based compensation expenses research and development general and administrative restructuring charges total share based compensation expenses total operating expenses 
table of contents research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities  as well as costs associated with our product development efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and manufacturing development efforts 
all research and development costs  including those funded by third parties  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses include external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third party contract research organizations and investigational sites where a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials are conducted  third party supplier  consultant and employee related expenses  which include salary and benefits  and facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
the table below sets forth our research and development expenses for  and and cumulative expenses for each of our lead product candidates based on our internal records and estimated allocations of employee time and related expenses from december  inception through december  preclinical and clinical development az az az az az other preclinical programs total preclinical and clinical development research total research and development research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decreases were due primarily to decreased spending on our az product candidate in connection with the termination of the license agreement with endo in january  and the suspension of the development of our az  az and az product candidates and decreased spending on basic research in connection with our decision to focus our resources on az these decreases were partially offset by increased spending on our az product candidates as we continued our development of these product candidates under the symphony allegro agreement  including our efforts to support an nda filing for az  which was filed in december  and the az phase b clinical trial which initiated in late and completed in we expect that research and development expenses will decrease in as we expect lower clinical expenses for az az  a result of our completing our clinical studies to support the nda for az and the completion of the phase a clinical study for az in we also expect lower employee related costs in  a result of our headcount reduction in the first quarter of we also expect our expenses for az  az  az  and az to be lower in as we do not intend to continue development of these programs unless we can partner the programs 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  legal and human resources functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility and information technology costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses  patent related costs and professional fees for legal  consulting and accounting services 
the decreases in general and administrative expenses were primarily due to decreased headcount expenses as a result of our restructuring in january  reduced facility expenses as we completed our move to our mountain view facility in the first half of  and our efforts to reduce third party costs to conserve cash balances 
we expect our general and administrative expenses in to remain relatively consistent with levels 
restructuring charges in january  we restructured our operations to focus our efforts on the continued rapid development of our az staccato loxapine product candidate 
the restructuring included a workforce reduction of employees  representing approximately of our total workforce and was completed in the second quarter of we incurred restructuring expenses related to employee severance and other termination benefits of million  including a non cash charge related to modifications to share based awards of  as of december   we have made all of our restructuring related payments 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  primarily represents income earned on our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities balances  and prior to august   marketable securities held by symphony allegro 
interest and other income  net was  for and million for the decrease was primarily due to lower average cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and lower interest rates earned on such balances 
we expect to continue to earn low interest income returns on our cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 
interest expense 
interest expense represents interest on our equipment loans and was  in and  in the decrease was due to decreases in the outstanding balances of our equipment loan borrowings as we made no additional borrowings in or change in the fair value of contingent consideration liability 
in connection with our acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of symphony allegro  we are obligated to pay the symphony investors certain percentages of cash payments that may be generated from future partnering transactions for az  az and or az we measure the fair value of this contingent consideration liability at each balance sheet date 
any changes in the fair value of this contingent consideration liability will be recognized in earnings in the period of the change 
certain events including  but not limited to  clinical trial results  fda approval or disapproval of our submissions  such as our nda filed in december  the timing and terms of strategic partnerships  such as our agreement with biovail executed in february  the commercial success of az  az and or az  and the discount rate assumption could have a material impact on the fair value of the contingent liability  and as a result  our results of operations 
in the third quarter of  we announced preliminary results from our phase b clinical trial of az  where az did not meet the primary endpoint of the study 
this change resulted in a decrease in the expected cash flow resulting in a decrease in the contingent consideration liability 
in the fourth quarter of  we modified our assumptions regarding the probability of certain cash flow outcomes to reflect the negotiations with biovail to partner az as well as the filing of our nda 
the reduction in these uncertainties resulted in an increase in probability of certain expected cash flow resulting in an increase in the contingent consideration liability 
these items combined resulted in our incurring a loss on the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability of million during the year ended december  loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in symphony allegro 
prior to our purchase of symphony allegro on august   pursuant to the agreements that we entered into with symphony allegro in december  we consolidated symphony allegro s financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  we deducted the losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest from our net loss in the consolidated statement of operations  and we reduced the noncontrolling interest holders ownership interest in symphony allegro in the consolidated balance sheet by the loss attributed to the noncontrolling interests in symphony allegro 
the losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders was million in and million in the decrease was primarily

we had  of revenues in and no revenues in in the third quarter of  we began to recognize revenues related to our endo license agreement 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increases were due primarily to increased spending on our az product candidates as we continued development of these product candidates under the symphony allegro agreement  including our first phase clinical trial of az which began enrollment in february and completed enrollment in june and our second phase clinical trial of az which began enrollment in july and completed enrollment in october  increased spending on our az product candidate as we continued development of this product candidate under the endo agreement  and increased research expenses as we increased our device development and manufacturing process scale up efforts 
these increases were partially offset by decreased spending on our az product candidate due to phase b clinical trial efforts and ongoing non clinical efforts occurring in  our az product candidate due to higher development and manufacturing efforts to modify the az device and manufacture clinical trial materials for the phase a trial in  and our az product candidate due to the preclinical and regulatory efforts in to support and prepare the ind filing that occurred in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increases were primarily due to increased staffing to manage and support our growth resulting in increased payroll and related expenses  increased third party intellectual property expenses as we continued to increase and maintain our intellectual property portfolio  and higher facilities expenses to support our growth 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  primarily represents income earned on our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities balances  and marketable securities held by symphony allegro 
interest and other income  net was million for and million for the decrease was primarily due to lower average cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and lower interest rates earned on such balances 
interest expense 
interest expense represents interest on our equipment loans and was million in and million in the decrease was primarily due to decreases in our equipment loan borrowings as we made no additional borrowing under our equipment financing agreements in loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in symphony allegro 
the losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders was million in and million in the increase was primarily due to increased spending on az  primarily the result of the two phase clinical trials in liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of equity securities receiving aggregate net proceeds from such sales totaling million  revenues primarily from a licensing agreement and government grants totaling million  and payments from symphony allegro 
we have received additional funding from equipment financing obligations  interest earned on investments  as 
table of contents described below  and funds received upon exercises of stock options and exercises of purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
our cash and marketable security balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including obligations of united states government agencies  high credit rating corporate borrowers and money market accounts 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the net cash used in each of these periods primarily reflects net loss for these periods  offset in part by depreciation  non cash stock based compensation  loss attributed to noncontrolling interests  and non cash changes in operating assets and liabilities

the decreases in accounts payables of million and accrued clinical trial expense and other accrued liabilities of million was due to the decrease in our operations 
in  the large decrease in other receivables was due to the collection of a receivable of million from endo in january related to the license agreement signed in december and a million receivable related to the reimbursement of leasehold improvements from the landlord of our mountain view facility in may in  the large increase in other receivables was affected by the above mentioned receivable from endo and the receivable relating to tenant improvements  which were outstanding in and collected in in  the increase in other liabilities is primarily due to million of deferred revenues related to the endo license agreement  and million of leasehold improvement reimbursements from the mountain view landlord recorded as deferred rent in net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million  and million in  and  respectively

changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than we currently anticipate 
we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect 
the key assumptions underlying these estimates include achievement of the milestones in the biovail agreement  expenditures related to continued preclinical and clinical development of our lead product candidates during this period within budgeted levels  
table of contents no unexpected costs related to the development of our manufacturing capability  and no growth in the number of our employees during this period 
our forecast of the period of time that our financial resources will be adequate to support operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in risk factors 
in light of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates and the extent to which we enter into strategic partnerships with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope  rate of progress  results and costs of our preclinical studies  clinical trials and other research and development activities  the terms and timing of any distribution  strategic partnerships or licensing agreements that we may establish  the cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals  the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue  the cost and timing of establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
we will need to raise additional funds to support our operations  and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs  reduce our efforts to build our commercial manufacturing capacity  and other operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic partnerships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects 
contractual obligations we lease two buildings with an aggregate of  square feet of manufacturing  office and laboratory facilities in mountain view  california  which we began to occupy in the fourth quarter of we currently occupy  square feet of these facilities and sublease the remaining  square feet 
beginning march   we will sublease an additional  square feet of these facilities  reducing the space we occupy to  square feet 
the lease for both facilities expires on march   and we have two options to extend the lease for five years each 
our sublease agreements expire on april  with regards to  square feet and on february  with regards to  square feet 
we believe that the mountain view facilities are sufficient for our office  manufacturing and laboratory needs for at least the next three years 
we have financed a portion of our equipment purchases through various equipment financing agreements 
under the agreements  equipment advances are to be repaid in to monthly installments of principal and interest 
the interest rate  which is fixed for each draw  is based on the us treasuries of comparable maturities and ranges from to 
the equipment purchased under the equipment financing agreement is pledged as security 

table of contents on november   we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement  or the supply agreement  with autoliv asp  inc  or autoliv  relating to the commercial supply of chemical heat packages that can be incorporated into our staccato device 
autoliv had developed these chemical heat packages for us pursuant to a development agreement executed in october under the terms of the supply agreement  autoliv will develop a manufacturing line capable of producing million chemical heat packages a year 
we have an obligation to pay autoliv million upon the earlier of december  or days after the approval by the food and drug administration of a new drug application filed by us 
if the agreement is terminated by either party  we will be required to reimburse autoliv up to million for certain expenses related to the equipment and tooling used in the production and testing of the chemical heat packages 
upon payment by us  autoliv will be required to transfer possession and ownership of such equipment and tooling to us 
each quarter  with assistance from autoliv  we estimate the amount of work performed on the development of the manufacturing line and recognize a portion of the total payment related to the manufacturing line as a capital asset and a corresponding non current liability 
autoliv has also agreed to manufacture  assemble and test the chemical heat packages solely for us in conformance with our specifications 
we will pay autoliv a specified purchase price  which varies based on annual quantities ordered by us  per chemical heat package delivered 
the initial term of the supply agreement expires on december  and may be extended by written mutual consent 
as of december   we recorded a fixed asset and a current liability of  based on our pdufa goal date of october   related to our commitment to autoliv for the development of the manufacturing line

this guidance requires that the noncontrolling interest continue to be attributed its share of losses even if that attribution results in a deficit noncontrolling interest balance 
this guidance also establishes additional reporting requirements that identify and distinguish between the ownership interest of the parent and the interest of the noncontrolling owners 
on january   we adopted this guidance and reclassified the noncontrolling interest in allegro from a liability to stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets on a retrospective basis 
had the previous requirements been applied  the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest would have decreased by  during the year ended december  in addition  consolidated net loss has been adjusted to include the net loss attributed to the noncontrolling interest in allegro and consolidated comprehensive income or loss has been adjusted to include the comprehensive income or loss attributed to the noncontrolling interest in allegro

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents  which have maturities of less than three months  and marketable securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our objectives  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have a material negative impact on the realized value of our investment portfolio 
we actively monitor changes in interest rates 
we perform quarterly reviews of our investment portfolio and believe we have no exposure related to mortgage and other asset backed securities and no exposure to auction rate securities
