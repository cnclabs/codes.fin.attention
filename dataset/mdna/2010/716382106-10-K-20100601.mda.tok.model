critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of our operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the data used to prepare them 
the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions  and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our estimates are guided by observing the following critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company generates revenue by selling prescription and non prescription pet medications and pet supplies primarily to retail consumers 
the company s policy is to recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment  when the rights of ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
outbound shipping and handling fees are included in sales and are billed upon shipment 
shipping expenses are included in cost of sales 
the majority of the company s sales are paid by credit cards and the company usually receives the cash settlement in two to three banking days 
credit card sales minimize accounts receivable balances relative to sales 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that the company estimates will arise from customers inability to make required payments  arising from either credit card charge backs or insuffi cient funds checks 
the company determines its estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts and current economic trends 
at march  and the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately  and  respectively

the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence 
the inventory reserve was approximately  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
advertising the company s advertising expense consists primarily of television advertising  internet marketing  and direct mail print advertising 
television advertising costs are expensed as the advertisements are televised 
internet costs are expensed in the month incurred and direct mail print advertising costs are expensed when the related catalogs  brochures  and postcards are produced  distributed  or superseded 
accounting for income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes asc topic  which generally requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax benefits or consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities  and are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws for the taxable years in which those differences are expected to reverse

the decrease in new order sales may be attributed to a reduction in advertising spending for the fiscal year  along with a reduction in the average order size 
the company has committed certain dollar amounts specifically designated towards television  direct mail print  and online advertising to stimulate sales  create brand awareness  and acquire new customers 
there can be no assurances that this growth trend will continue  due to increasing competition from veterinarians and traditional and online retailers  and a reduction in our average order size

television advertising has been the company s predominant marketing method for several years 
historically  there has been a direct correlation between the amount of television advertising done by the company and its sales 
sales may also be affected by consumers giving more consideration to price and trading down to less expensive retail brands  which we may not carry 
in response to these trends  the company is currently attempting to shift some advertising dollars from television to both on line and print campaigns  and offer more promotions to our existing database to encourage reorders and reactivate inactive customers 
however  there can be no assurances that the alter native advertising strategies to television will have the same impact on our sales and more aggressive sales promotions could also result in a decrease to gross profit margins 
no guarantees can be made that the company s efforts will be successful  or that sales will continue to grow

the company reduced the unrealized impairment loss to  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  within accumulated other comprehensive loss  based upon an assessment of the fair value of these ars 
the  impairment was recorded as temporary due to the fact that the company has both the ability and intent to hold these securities until anticipated recovery or maturity 
however  it could take until the final maturity or issuer refinancing of the underlying debt for us to realize the recorded value of our investments in these securities 
if the issuers of our ars are unable to successfully close future auctions or redeem or refinance the securities and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an additional impairment charge on these investments  or may need to sell these securities on a secondary market 
although we believe we will be able to liquidate our investments in these securities without any significant loss  the timing and financial impact of such an outcome is uncertain 
based on our expected cash expenditures  our cash and cash equivalents balance  and other potential sources of cash  we do not anticipate that the potential lack of liquidity of these investments in the near term will adversely affect our ability to execute our current business plan

any amounts expended for capital expenditures would be the result of an increase in the capacity needed to adequately provide for any increase in our business 
to date we have paid for any needed additions to our capital equipment infrastructure from working capital funds and anticipate this being the case in the future 
presently  we have approximately  forecasted for capital expenditures to further support and maintain the company s growth in fiscal which will be funded through cash from operations 
the company s source of working capital includes cash from operations and the exercise of stock options

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the value of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
the book values of cash equivalents  short and long term investments  accounts receivable  and accounts payable are considered to be representative of fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
interest rates affect our return on excess cash and investments 
as of march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  and million in long term investments 
a majority of our cash and cash equivalents and investments generate interest income based on prevailing interest rates 
a significant change in interest rates would impact the amount of interest income generated from our excess cash and investments 
it would also impact the market value of our investments 
our investments are subject to market risk  primarily interest rate and credit risk 
our investments are managed by a limited number of outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by our board of directors 
such guidelines include security type  credit quality  and maturity  and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with both short and long term maturities 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments that could expose us to significant market risk 
at march   we had no debt obligations
