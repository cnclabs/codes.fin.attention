item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as those discussed in any documents incorporated by reference herein or therein 
when used in this annual report  the terms questcor  company  we  our  ours and us refer to questcor pharmaceuticals  inc and its consolidated subsidiary 
overview we are a pharmaceutical company focused on diseases and disorders for which there is significant unmet medical need 
our primary drug is hp acthar gel repository corticotropin injection  an injectable drug that is approved by the us food and drug administration fda for the treatment of a variety of diseases and disorders 
since  we have sought to identify diseases and disorders in which the use of acthar could improve patient outcomes 
among the many indications for which it is approved  acthar is approved for the treatment of exacerbations associated with multiple sclerosis ms and  in  we identified a subset of the ms patient population who do not respond to the standard therapies for ms exacerbations as potential candidates for acthar 
in  we significantly expanded our sales force dedicated to the ms market and have experienced strong sales growth in this market 
acthar is also used in treating patients with infantile spasms is  a rare form of refractory childhood epilepsy  and opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome  a rare autoimmune related childhood neurological disorder  but is not approved for the treatment of either disorder 
while we do not promote acthar for the treatment of is  a significant percentage of our net sales is derived from the treatment of this disorder 
acthar is approved to induce a diuresis or a remission of proteinuria in the nephrotic syndrome ns without uremia of the idiopathic type or that due to lupus erythamatosus 
ns is a kidney disorder characterized by high levels of protein in the urine and low levels of protein in the blood that often leads to end stage renal disease 
during the fourth quarter of  we generated a modest amount of net sales as a result of physicians writing prescriptions for acthar to treat ns  and we are working to generate more clinical data to further support the effectiveness of acthar in the treatment of this disorder 
from time to time we receive prescriptions for acthar for other conditions 
we are also in discussions with experts in other disease states with high unmet medical needs for which there is a potential therapeutic role for acthar 
we also market doral quazepam  which is indicated for the treatment of insomnia 
in august  we announced our acthar centric business strategy  which included a new pricing level for acthar effective august  the strategy was adopted in order to best ensure financial viability and continued availability of acthar  establish support programs to benefit acthar patients  advance our product development programs and ensure that the company became economically viable 
since the adoption of the strategy  we have expanded our sponsorship of acthar patient assistance and co pay assistance programs  which provide an important safety net for uninsured and under insured patients using acthar  and have established a group of representatives and medical science liaisons to work with healthcare providers who administer acthar 
we continue to support the acthar patient assistance programs administered by the national organization for rare disorders nord 
these and other patient oriented support programs have now provided free drug with commercial value of over million to patients since september in addition to the free drug program  significant financial support continues to be provided to needy patients through nord s co pay assistance programs that we sponsor 
we have been working closely with the neurology community to identify promising new research projects for which we can provide needed financial support 
we are providing support to leading researchers in their efforts to better understand the underlying disease processes that cause infantile spasms  a subject for which there has been little research funding in recent decades  as well as to better understand the drug s mechanisms of action 

table of contents acthar is currently approved in the us for the treatment of ms exacerbations  nephrotic syndrome and many other conditions 
pursuant to guidelines published by the american academy of neurology and the child neurology society  many child neurologists use acthar to treat infants afflicted with is even though it is not approved for this indication 
in december  our supplemental new drug application snda to add the treatment of infantile spasms to the acthar label was accepted for filing by the fda 
the fda has set the user fee goal date  also known as the pdufa date  for action on our filing of june  for this snda 
there can be no assurance that this date will be met or that the snda will be approved 
previously  the fda granted orphan designation to the active ingredient in acthar for the treatment of is 
as a result of this orphan designation  if we are successful in obtaining fda approval for the is indication  we believe we will also qualify for a seven year exclusivity period during which the fda is prohibited from approving any other adrenocorticotropic hormone acth formulation for is unless the other formulation is demonstrated to be clinically superior to acthar or is considered by the fda to have an active ingredient that is different from the active ingredient of acthar 
however  it is unclear what impact the potential approval of our snda may have  as acthar is already used in the treatment of is 
during early  we observed some continued usage  as well as favorable insurance coverage  in refractory ms patients who do not respond to  or who cannot tolerate  intravenous corticosteroids  the first line treatment of most neurologists for ms exacerbations 
questcor sponsored market research indicates that as many as of ms exacerbation patients may be in this subset 
in response  we completed the initial phase of our ms sales force expansion plan in the summer of during the first quarter of  we completed the second phase of our sales force expansion 
during this second phase  we completed significant territorial realignments 
during the third quarter of  we completed a third phase of our sales force expansion which added sales representatives to unassigned territories 
our expanded sales force of representatives and managers allows us to build upon continued positive growth trends in prescriptions of acthar for the treatment of exacerbations associated with ms 
in october  we announced that we are evaluating nephrotic syndrome as a potential new growth opportunity for acthar 
nephrotic syndrome is characterized by excessive spilling of protein from the kidneys into the urine  a condition known as proteinuria 
acthar is specifically indicated to induce a diuresis or a remission of proteinuria in the nephrotic syndrome without uremia of the idiopathic type or that due to lupus erythamatosus 
if not adequately treated  patients suffering from nephrotic syndrome often progress to end stage renal disease 
end stage renal disease is a serious  life threatening condition whose current treatments  including renal dialysis and kidney transplant  are expensive and can have a significant negative impact on quality of life 
nephrotic syndrome can be caused by a number of different diseases and disorders of the kidney 
we are currently funding more than two dozen pre clinical and clinical investigator initiated studies 
many of these studies are examining the use of acthar in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome 
we are also now beginning to fund exploratory pre clinical research evaluating whether acthar could have potential value in the management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis also known as als or lou gehrig s disease and traumatic brain injury 
efforts to identify additional potential new uses for acthar are ongoing 
as we generate clinical data that supports the effectiveness of acthar in new uses  we will develop marketing plans to reach these new markets 
while our primary strategy is to further penetrate our existing markets for acthar and to identify and pursue new markets for acthar  we are also in the early stages of exploring potential investment and acquisition opportunities to diversify our product portfolio 
in evaluating these opportunities  we are focused on marketed pharmaceutical products and companies with marketed pharmaceutical products rather than development stage products 
although we have stringent acquisition criteria and management expertise in marketed pharmaceutical products  we might not be successful in identifying suitable candidates or in making acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms 
see item a risk factors risks associated with our growth initiatives our strategy to diversify our product portfolio might not be successful for a discussion of additional risks related to investments and acquisitions 
our total net sales were million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our net income applicable to common shareholders was million for the year ended december  as compared to net income applicable to common shareholders of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million as compared to million as of december  
table of contents during  we repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock for million under our stock repurchase program  at an average price of per share 
in may  our board of directors increased our common share repurchase program authorization by an additional million shares 
as of december   there are a total of million shares authorized remaining under the revised stock repurchase program 
since the initiation of this program  we have returned approximately million to shareholders through our common and preferred stock buyback efforts 
we have registered trademarks on hp acthar gel and doral 
any other trademark  trade name or service mark appearing in this document belongs to its respective holder 
we believe that our trademarks  trade names and service marks have value and play an important role in our business efforts

we do not intend for the information contained on our website to be part of this annual report 
hp acthar gel hp acthar gel  which we acquired in july  is a natural source injectable preparation containing adrenocorticotropic hormone acth 
acthar is specially formulated to provide prolonged release after intramuscular or subcutaneous injection 
one primary mechanism of action for acthar is the stimulation of the adrenal cortex to secrete endogenous corticosteroids  including cortisol  corticosterone  aldosterone  and a number of weakly androgenic substances 
it is believed by certain key medical researchers that there are likely to be additional mechanisms of action for acthar 
questcor has initiated the funding of several studies to provide additional evidence for these mechanisms 
acthar was approved by the fda in it is used in a wide variety of conditions  including the treatment of exacerbations associated with multiple sclerosis  infantile spasms  opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome and nephrotic syndrome 
acthar is indicated for use in acute exacerbations of ms 
intravenous methylprednisolone is the most common treatment for this indication  but acthar is used by some neurologists for patients who do not respond adequately to intravenous methylprednisolone or who cannot tolerate intravenous methylprednisolone 
although the fda approved package labeling does not include is as an fda approved indication  acthar has historically been used to treat this condition 
based on the document entitled practice parameter medical treatment of infantile spasms  a report of the american academy of neurology and the child neurology society  we believe that there has been no clinical evidence to show that any therapy is better than acthar for the treatment of is 
is is an epileptic syndrome characterized by the triad of infantile spasms generalized seizures  hypsarrhythmia and arrest of psychomotor development at seizure onset 
we estimate that as many as  children annually experience bouts of this devastating syndrome in the us in of children with is  the spasms occur during the first year of life  typically between to months of age 
the first onset rarely occurs after the age of two 
patients left untreated or treated inadequately have a poor prognosis for intellectual and functional development 
rapid and aggressive therapy to control the abnormal seizure activity appears to improve the chances that these children will develop to their fullest potential 
in addition to being indicated for the treatment of exacerbations of ms and nephrotic syndrome  acthar has over fifty other labeled indications and uses in certain endocrine disorders  rheumatic disorders  collagen diseases  allergic states  ophthalmic diseases  respiratory diseases  hematologic disorders  neoplastic diseases  edematous states  and gastrointestinal diseases 
questcor is currently studying the potential use of acthar in certain of these and other indications and may fund additional studies 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will ever successfully market acthar as a treatment for any of these disorders or diseases 
for the years ended december   and  net sales of acthar were million  million and million  respectively 
doral in may  we purchased the rights in the united states to doral from medpointe now meda pharmaceuticals pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement 
doral is a commercial product indicated for the 
table of contents treatment of insomnia 
net sales of doral were   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
product development in november  we initiated a clinical development program under our investigational new drug application with the fda for qsc  a unique orally disintegrating tablet odt formulation of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen hb apap for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain in patients with swallowing difficulties 
qsc is being formulated by eurand pharmaceuticals  inc and would utilize eurand s proprietary microcaps taste masking and advatab tm odt technologies 
we own the world wide rights to commercialize qsc and eurand would exclusively supply the product and receive a royalty on product sales 
hb apap  in its variety of strengths  is one of the most frequently prescribed products in the us and there are currently no odt formulations of hb apap available in the united states 
for the many pain patients who experience significant difficulty swallowing pills  we believe qsc represents a valuable option for the treatment of their pain 
during the third quarter of  we completed formulation development of qsc currently  we are seeking a partner to complete development of this product so that our research and development resources can be focused on pursuing the potential growth opportunities for acthar that have been identified 
questcor continues to incur expenses pursuing obtaining approval for the treatment of is with acthar as well as funding numerous research projects for is  ms  nephrotic syndrome and other diseases and disorders 
our research and development expense totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
manufacturing our products are manufactured for us by approved contract manufacturers 
acthar has a shelf life of months from the date of manufacture 
in  we transferred the acthar final fill and packaging process from aventis to our contract manufacturer  cangene biopharma  inc  formerly known as chesapeake biological laboratories  inc cangene  and produced our first lot of acthar finished vials 
this transfer was approved by the fda in january in january we entered into a supply agreement with cangene pursuant to which cangene will continue to manufacture supplies of acthar for us the supply agreement 
the supply agreement is in effect until terminated by either cangene or questcor subject to not less than twelve months termination notice 
in  we transferred the acthar active pharmaceutical ingredient api manufacturing process from aventis to our contract manufacturer  biovectra dcl biovectra  and produced the first biovectra api lot 
the acthar api manufacturing site transfer was approved by the fda in june we have signed an agreement with biovectra  which terminates on december  and includes a one year extension option 
while we have received approval for the acthar finished vials and api transfers to new contract manufacturers  the processes used to manufacture and test acthar are complex and subject to fda inspection and approval 
doral has a shelf life of months from the date of manufacture 
we entered into a separate supply agreement with meda pharmaceuticals meda  formerly medpointe for doral 
our agreement with meda calls for meda to procure the raw materials and manufacture and package doral 
the api used in doral is procured by meda from a third party supplier 
a new manufacturer of the api was approved by the fda in november there can be no assurance that any of our api or finished goods contract manufacturers will continue to meet our requirements for quality  quantity and timeliness 
also  there can be no assurance our contract manufacturers will be able to meet all of the fda s current good manufacturing practice cgmp requirements  or that lots will not have to be recalled with the attendant financial or other consequences to us 
our dependence upon others for the manufacture of api or our finished products  or for the manufacture of products that we may acquire or develop  may adversely affect the future profit margin on the sale of those products and our ability to develop and deliver products on a timely and competitive basis 
we do not have substitute suppliers for our products although we strive to plan appropriately and maintain safety stocks of product to cover unforeseen events at manufacturing sites 

table of contents divested product rights in june  we sold to hale biopharma ventures  llc  a development stage company  our rights  including certain patents  relating to the nasal administration of benzodiazepines  which resulted in total proceeds of  as additional consideration for the purchased assets  hale biopharma has agreed to pay questcor certain milestone and royalty payments based on the achievement of certain objectives 
the transferred products require further development and regulatory approval before any sales could occur and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will receive any milestone or royalty payments 
in june  we sold to evoke pharma  inc  a development stage company  our rights relating to nasally administered metaclopromide or other pharmaceutical products covered by the claims set forth in us patent nos 
 and  which resulted in total net proceeds of  the purchased assets included various regulatory filings with the fda and the unregistered trademarks emitasol and pramidin 
as additional consideration for the purchased assets  evoke has agreed to pay certain milestone and royalty payments based on the achievement of certain objectives 
the transferred products require further development and regulatory approval before any sales could occur and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will receive any milestone or royalty payments 
sales and marketing we own the worldwide rights for acthar and the us rights for doral 
we do not have substantial operations outside the us however  we have agreements with the following companies to market and distribute acthar on a named patient basis in certain other countries 
beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd 
we have an agreement with beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd 
beacon of tunbridge wells  kent  uk  for the exclusive marketing and distribution of acthar in the united kingdom on a named patient basis 
gross sales to beacon were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
idis limited we have an agreement with idis limited idis of sirbiton  surrey  uk for the exclusive distribution of acthar on a named patient basis 
the agreement covers all countries of the world except the united states  australia  new zealand  and the uk  where acthar is sold through beacon 
we did not have any sales to idis for the years ended december  and gross sales to idis were  for the year ended december  competition the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products that target the same diseases and conditions that we target 
there are products and treatments on the market that compete with acthar 
moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by our competitors  which may prevent us from obtaining this technology on favorable terms  or at all 
most of our competitors are larger than us and have substantially greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we have 
if any of our present or future competitors develop new products that are superior to acthar  our performance may be materially and adversely affected 
certain potentially competitive products to acthar are in various stages of development  some of which have been approved by regulatory authorities in the us and other countries 
vigabatrin is a potentially competitive anti convulsive product that was approved by the fda for the treatment of is and introduced into the us market in september solu medrol methylprednisolone sodium succinate and its generic versions are the primary competitive product to acthar for the treatment of ms exacerbations 

table of contents the current success of our acthar centric business strategy is likely to attract additional competition 
see item a risk factors risks associated with acthar for a discussion of additional risks related to competition 
government regulation marketed pharmaceutical products our operations associated with the production  testing  packaging and distribution of pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by the fda 
any restrictions or prohibitions applicable to sales of products we market could materially and adversely affect our business 
we market prescription drug products that have been approved by the fda  though the fda has the authority to revoke existing approvals if new information reveals that a particular drug is not safe or effective 
the fda also regulates the promotion  including the advertisement  of prescription drugs 
in september  the food and drug administration amendments act of  or fdaaa  was signed into law 
this legislation granted significant new powers to the fda  many of which are aimed at addressing the safety of drug products before and after approval 
the law authorizes the fda to  among other things  require post approval studies and clinical trials  mandate changes to drug labeling to reflect new safety information  and require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies rems for certain drugs  including certain currently approved drugs 
in addition  the law significantly expanded the federal government s clinical trial registry and results databank and created restrictions on the advertising and promotion of drug products 
under the fdaaa  companies that violate these and other provisions of the law are subject to substantial monetary and other civil penalties 
pursuant to the fdaaa  the fda has been actively implementing rems as a condition of drug approval  or after initial marketing  if the fda becomes aware of new safety data about the drug 
however  the actual effect of these developments on our own business is uncertain and unpredictable 
the requirements and other changes that the fdaaa imposes may make it more difficult  and likely more costly  to obtain approval of new indications for acthar or maintain approval for existing approved indications  and it is uncertain whether the fdaaa may impact the approval of our snda 
drug products must be manufactured  tested  packaged  and labeled in accordance with their approvals and in conformity with cgmp standards and other requirements 
drug manufacturing facilities must be registered with and approved by the fda and must list with the fda the drug products they intend to manufacture or distribute 
the manufacturer is subject to inspections by the fda and periodic inspections by other regulatory agencies 
the fda has extensive enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers  including authority to seize and prohibit the sale of unapproved or non complying products  and to halt any pharmaceutical operations that are not in compliance with cgmps 
the courts may impose criminal penalties arising from non compliance with applicable fda regulations 
in march we received a drug class action letter from the fda requesting modifications to labeling and creation of a medication guide for sedative hypnotic drug products that are indicated for the treatment of insomnia  including our product doral 
we have revised doral s labeling and created a medication guide  both of which have been approved by the fda 
in february we began shipping doral product with the revised labeling and new medication guide 
the doral label was revised and approved by the fda in to include results from an in vitro inhibition study conducted by questcor in which quazepam the active pharmaceutical ingredient in doral was found to be a mechanistic inhibitor of cypb this in vitro study shows that there is the potential of drug interactions between doral and cypb substrates such as bupropion trade name wellbutrin xl 
the fda has required questcor to conduct a small clinical trial patients aimed at determining if the drug to drug interactions between doral and bupropion are observed in patients 
this clinical study is planned to commence in the second quarter of and will be completed in additionally  a patent was issued to questcor in based on the observed in vitro drug to drug interactions between doral and bupropion 
questcor operates in a highly regulated industry 
we are subject to the regulatory authority of the securities and exchange commission  the food and drug administration and numerous other federal and state governmental agencies including state attorney general offices  which have become more active in investigating the business 
table of contents practices of pharmaceutical companies 
from time to time  we receive informal requests for information from various governmental agencies 
on february   we received a civil investigative demand cid from the attorney general of the state of missouri  in connection with that office s investigation into our pricing practices with respect to acthar under missouri s merchandising practices act 
on may   we received a subpoena from the attorney general of the state of new york  in connection with that office s investigation  under new york s antitrust statute and federal antitrust statutes  of our acquisition of acthar from aventis in  our acthar royalty arrangements and our subsequent pricing of acthar 
we have provided documents and information to the attorneys general of missouri and new york  and will continue to cooperate with these offices if called upon to do so 
there can be no assurance that these types of requests for information or investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
see item a risk factors risks associated with government regulations and health care reform we are currently subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes for a discussion of risks related to government regulation of marketed pharmaceutical products 
drugs in development products in development are subject to extensive regulation by the us  principally under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and the public health service act  and if applicable by foreign governmental authorities 
in particular  drugs and biological products are subject to rigorous pre clinical and clinical testing and other approval requirements by the fda  state and local authorities and comparable foreign regulatory authorities 
the process for obtaining the required regulatory approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities takes many years and is very expensive 
there can be no assurance that any product developed by us and current or potential development partners will prove to meet all of the applicable standards to receive marketing approval in the us or abroad 
there can be no assurance that these approvals will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
delays and costs in obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal  state and local statutes and regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and our ability to earn sales revenues 
product liability insurance the clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing of our products may expose us to product liability claims  against which we maintain liability insurance 
see item a risk factors other risks associated with our business if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or we become subject to other forms of litigation  we may incur substantial liabilities and costs and may be required to limit commercialization of our products for a discussion of certain risks related to product liability claims that may be made against us 
patents and proprietary rights our success may depend in part upon our ability to maintain confidentiality  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties  and obtain patent protection for our products 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
we do not have a patent on acthar 
however  we do have a us patent related to doral  and us and foreign patents relating to certain of our other technology 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products or services 
unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products  services or proprietary information 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights as well as the laws of the united states 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be time consuming and costly 
we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as we expand our product and service offerings and the number of competitors increases 
defending against these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive and divert our attention from operating our company 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing upon their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and be forced to 
table of contents develop non infringing technology  obtain a license or cease using the applications that contain the infringing technology or content 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or content or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
see item a risk factors other risks associated with our business if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  we may lose our competitive position and future revenues for a discussion of additional risks related to intellectual property rights 
employees as of december  and we had and full time employees  respectively 
during  we completed two phases of our ms sales force expansion plan  hiring and training our sales force as well as completing all territorial realignments 
our expanded sales force of representatives and managers allows us to build upon continued positive growth trends in prescriptions of acthar for the treatment of exacerbations associated with ms  an indication for which acthar is already approved 
in addition  our sales force provides a platform for initiating sales of acthar  or other pharmaceutical products  for additional uses 
our continued success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain key employees 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  nor have we experienced work stoppages

financial information please refer to item  selected consolidated financial data  for a review of our financial results and financial position for the five years ended december   and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a review of revenue and net income for the three years ended december  item a 
risk factors risks associated with acthar substantially all of our revenue and profits are derived from acthar 
for the year ended december   sales of acthar represented of our total net sales 
we expect to continue to rely on this product for substantially all of our revenues and profits for the foreseeable future 
also  for the year ended december   a significant percentage of acthar prescriptions were for is  which is not an approved indication for acthar 
the demand for acthar used to treat is is highly variable  and we cannot predict whether we will continue to generate significant revenues from sales of acthar for the treatment of is 
if the demand for acthar declines  if competitive products including vigabatrin approved by the fda for the treatment of is are used to the exclusion of acthar  if the fda requires us to make changes to the label of acthar which harm our ability to market acthar for approved indications  if third party payors refuse to provide reimbursement for purchases of acthar  if we are forced to reduce the price for acthar  if a greater proportion of our acthar unit sales is comprised of product dispensed to medicaid eligible patients and certain government entities where we do not recognize any net sales  or if we are forced to re negotiate important contracts or terms  our net sales from the sale of acthar would decline 
if the cost to produce acthar increases  our gross margins on the sale of acthar would decline 
if our net sales or gross margins from the sale of acthar decline  our ability to generate profits would be harmed 
we utilize curascript  a third party specialty distributor  to distribute acthar 
we rely on curascript for all of our proceeds from sales of acthar in the united states 
the outsourcing of these functions is complex  and we may 
table of contents experience difficulties that could reduce  delay or stop shipments of acthar 
if we encounter such distribution problems  and we are unable to quickly enter into a similar agreement with another specialty distributor on substantially similar terms  acthar distribution could become disrupted  resulting in lost revenues or customer dissatisfaction 
we rely on contract manufacturers to produce acthar 
the manufacturing process for acthar is complex and contract manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs with respect to timing  cost  quantity or quality 
all of our manufacturers are sole source manufacturers and no currently qualified alternative suppliers exist 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of acthar on acceptable terms  or if we encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with our manufacturers  we will lose the ability to fulfill orders and thus will lose sales 
moreover  contract manufacturers that we use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practices enforced by the fda 
if the facilities of these manufacturers cannot pass an inspection  supply would be disrupted 
failure to obtain products for sale for any reason may result in an inability to meet acthar demand and a loss of potential revenues 
we cannot predict whether the fda will approve our snda for acthar 
we are continuing to pursue a supplemental new drug application snda to the fda to add the treatment of infantile spasms is to the list of approved indications on the acthar label 
in december  our snda was accepted for filing by the fda to add the treatment of infantile spasms to the acthar label 
the fda has notified us that an advisory committee meeting of independent experts will be held to discuss the approval and use of acthar in infantile spasm 
the fda has set the user fee goal date  also known as the pdufa date  for action on our filing of june  for this snda 
however  there can be no assurance as to the actual timetable for fda action or whether the advisory committee will recommend approval or the snda will be approved by the fda 
additionally  in connection with the application process  the fda could require various actions by the company including modification of the existing acthar label or the adoption of fda mandated risk evaluation and mitigation strategies  also known as a rems program 
these requirements could increase our costs or limit our sales of acthar 
a significant percentage of acthar prescriptions is for is  which is not an approved indication for acthar 
while physicians may lawfully prescribe acthar for is and other off label uses  any promotion by us for off label uses would be unlawful 
the fda has approved a competitive product  vigabatrin  for the treatment of is 
we are restricted from countering claims made by the sales force for fda approved competitive products  which increases the risk that competitive products may be prescribed for is instead of acthar 
we are aware of several competitors attempting to develop and market products competitive to acthar  which may reduce or eliminate our commercial opportunity 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological changes  and a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products that target the same diseases and conditions that we target 
some of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in development  manufacturing  obtaining regulatory approvals  and marketing than we do 
other smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
in the event we are successful in expanding the therapeutic reach for acthar  other companies may dedicate greater resources to develop and introduce generic versions of acthar and other competitive therapies for the diseases and conditions that we target 
we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of potentially competitive products or their possible effect on our sales 
certain potentially competitive products to acthar are in various stages of development  some of which have been filed for approval with the fda  or have already been approved by the fda or regulatory authorities in other countries 
vigabatrin sabril is a competitive anti convulsive product that was approved by the fda for the treatment of is and introduced into the us market in september prednisone and prednisolone are the generic names for anti inflammatory corticosteroid drugs that are used to treat various types of inflammation 
one off label use of these drugs has been to treat is 
should more doctors 
table of contents prescribe prednisone or prednisolone to target the same diseases and conditions that acthar targets  the result could be detrimental to current acthar sales 
in addition to the possibility of competitive products not based on acth  a competitor could seek approval for  and the fda could approve  a generic version of acthar 
acthar does not have any patent or other form of exclusivity protection that would legally prevent the fda from approving a generic version 
if a competitor applied to the fda for a generic version  we would not receive any notice from the fda about the existence of the application 
our strategy to generate acthar revenue from other therapeutic areas might not be successful 
acthar was approved by the fda in  with over approved indications on its label  including nephrotic syndrome 
at that time  in order to receive fda approval for a drug it was not necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of that drug for the indications for which approval was sought 
ms was added to the label in  when efficacy was required to be demonstrated 
there is limited data on the efficacy of acthar in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome 
it is unclear what amount of clinical or other data physicians will require prior to deciding whether or not to use acthar in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome 
we have funded multiple investigator initiated studies relating to use of acthar to treat nephrotic syndrome but these studies are at early stages and it is unclear if any of these studies will result in data that supports the use of acthar to treat nephrotic syndrome 
further  even if one or more of these studies produce positive data  these studies are not the same as randomized clinical trials and it is unclear whether any such data will result in doctors prescribing acthar for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome 
the use of acthar for the treatment of ms flares is generally accepted  but the primary treatment for flares is iv corticosteroids 
while we have had some initial success in positioning acthar as a second line treatment for ms flares for patients who do not respond to iv corticosteroids  it is unclear whether we will continue to be able to expand this market or even maintain our current level of sales in this market 
while there are over approved indications on the acthar label  for many of these indications it is not likely that we will be successful in generating net sales in the near future 
further  under the food and drug administration amendments act of  the fda has greater authority to require sponsors to modify labels of previously approved drugs 
if the fda requires us to remove any indications for which we were previously approved  we may not be able to market acthar for those indications  thus potentially decreasing our revenue 
if we are successful in growing our sales in the ms and nephrotic syndrome markets  or in developing other markets for acthar  our increasing the overall sales volume of acthar may lead other companies to dedicate greater resources to develop and introduce generic versions of acthar or other competitive therapies for the diseases and conditions that we target 
the manufacture of our products is a highly exacting and complex process  and if any of our suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products  our business could suffer 
biological products such as acthar require production processes that are significantly more complicated than those required for chemical pharmaceuticals  due in part to strict regulatory requirements 
problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons  including equipment malfunction  failure to follow specific protocols and procedures  problems with raw materials  natural disasters  and environmental factors 
in addition  we currently use single suppliers for our products and materials 
if problems arise during the production of a batch of product  that batch of product may have to be discarded 
this could  among other things  lead to increased costs  lost revenue  damage to company reputation and customer relations  time and expense spent investigating the cause and  depending on the cause  similar losses with respect to other batches or products 
if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market  recall and product liability costs may also be incurred 
to the extent that one of our suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems  this could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
for example  in the quarter ended september   the company reserved approximately  for a manufactured lot of acthar that did not meet applicable specifications 

table of contents acthar is derived from the extraction and purification of porcine pituitary glands through complicated processes  and is difficult to manufacture 
we have a supply agreement with biovectra dcl to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient in acthar 
the supply agreement with biovectra terminates on december   and includes a mutual one year extension option 
if we are unable to extend or renew our supply agreement with biovectra or enter into a new supply agreement on substantially similar terms with a new manufacturer  or are unable to obtain fda approval for a new manufacturer  we may not be able to manufacture or sell acthar  which would result in a substantial loss of revenues and damage to our business 
we have a supply agreement with cangene biopharma  inc cangene  formerly known as chesapeake biological laboratories  inc  to produce our finished vials of acthar 
the supply agreement with cangene is in effect until terminated by either party upon twelve months notice 
if either party cancels the supply agreement  and we are unable to enter into a new supply agreement on substantially similar terms with a new manufacturer  or are unable to obtain fda approval for a new manufacturer  we may not be able to manufacture or sell acthar  which would result in a substantial loss of revenues and damage to our business 
risks associated with our non acthar growth initiatives we have a very limited pipeline of new products 
since the adoption of our acthar centric business model in august  we have focused our research and development efforts on acthar 
besides acthar  our pipeline of potential new products consists of a single development program qsc in february  we announced that we were seeking a partner to complete development of qsc there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify such a partner or successfully negotiate a license or other agreement with commercially reasonable terms 
such terms could include deferred consideration in the form of milestone payments and royalties and there can be no assurance that any such payments or royalties would actually become due to questcor 
our strategy to diversify our product portfolio might not be successful 
to remain competitive and grow our business  we must launch new products and technologies 
to accomplish this  we intend to commit efforts  funds  and other resources to research and development and business development 
even with acquired products and technologies  a high rate of failure is inherent in the acquisition of pharmaceutical products 
we must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that our efforts will be commercially successful 
failure can occur at any point in the process  including after significant funds have been invested 
for example  promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns  failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes  inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals  limited scope of approved uses  excessive costs to manufacture  the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights  or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
even if we successfully acquire or develop new products  they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences  changing industry standards  or competitors innovations 
innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of  among other things  entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third party reimbursement 
we cannot state with certainty when or whether we will be able to develop  license  or otherwise acquire compounds or products  or whether any products will be commercially successful 
failure to launch successful new products or new indications for acthar may cause our products to become obsolete  causing our revenues and operating results to suffer 
we may have insufficient capital to fund our growth initiatives and may be forced to seek dilutive financing 
the acquisition of new products or businesses is expensive  which may require us to raise additional capital in excess of our current cash and short term investments 
in the current economic environment  we may not be able to raise enough capital to acquire prospective products or businesses 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our existing shareholders ownership will be diluted 
any debt  receivables or royalty financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations 
these restrictive covenants may include 
table of contents limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens  pay dividends  redeem our stock or make investments 
risks associated with government regulations and health care reform federal and or state health care reform initiatives could negatively affect our business 
bills and regulations proposing comprehensive health care reform are being formulated in congress and state legislatures as well as in agencies of those governmental bodies that could potentially limit pharmaceutical prices and establish mandatory or voluntary refunds 
new legislation has been proposed in the united states at the federal and state levels that would effect major changes in the health care system  either nationally or at the state level 
recently  president obama and members of congress have proposed significant reforms 
on november   the house of representatives passed  and on december   the senate passed health care reform legislation that would require most individuals to have health insurance  establish new regulations on health plans  create insurance pooling mechanisms and a government insurance option to compete with private plans and other expanded health measures 
president obama introduced additional proposals in february because legislation has not yet been enacted  it is still not possible to determine what  if any  impact this legislation may have on the pharmaceutical industry and our business 
it is further uncertain if any legislative proposals will be adopted and how federal  state or private payors for health care goods and services will be impacted by or respond to any health care reforms 
the high cost of pharmaceutical prices continues to generate substantial government interest 
various governmental entities may focus on pharmaceutical prices by holding hearings or launching investigations regarding the pricing for drugs by specialty pharmaceutical companies such as ours and the ability of patients to obtain drugs 
in december  the government accounting office released its report on the growing cost of brand name prescription drugs 
in addition  in july  the joint economic committee of congress held hearings on the pricing of drugs for rare conditions 
should hearings or investigations occur that result in legislative changes or consent decrees regarding drug pricing  we may be forced to decrease the price that we charge for acthar  thereby decreasing our net income 
questcor operates in a highly regulated industry 
we are subject to the regulatory authority of the securities and exchange commission  the food and drug administration and numerous other federal and state governmental agencies including state attorney general offices  which have become more active in investigating the business practices of pharmaceutical companies 
from time to time  we receive requests for information from various governmental agencies 
on february   we received a civil investigative demand cid from the attorney general of the state of missouri  in connection with that office s investigation of our pricing practices with respect to acthar under missouri s merchandising practices act 
on may   we received a subpoena from the attorney general of the state of new york in connection with that office s investigation  under new york s antitrust statute and federal antitrust statutes  of our acquisition of acthar from aventis in  our acthar royalty arrangements and our subsequent pricing of acthar 
we have provided documents and information to the attorneys general of missouri and new york  and will continue to cooperate with these attorneys general if called upon to do so 
there can be no assurance that these types of requests for information or investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may be negatively affected by lower reimbursement levels 
notwithstanding the impact of any proposed health care reform legislation  our ability to generate net sales is affected by the availability of third party reimbursement for acthar  and our ability to generate net sales will be diminished if we fail to maintain an adequate level of reimbursement for acthar from such third party payors 
the sale of acthar depends in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as private insurance plans 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  a number of state and federal proposals that limit the amount that private insurance plans may pay to reimburse the cost of drugs  including acthar 
we believe the increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of acthar  which may also impact sales of acthar 
in addition  current third party reimbursement policies for acthar may change at any time 
negative changes in reimbursement or our failure to 
table of contents obtain reimbursement for acthar may reduce the demand for  or the price of  acthar  which could result in lower acthar sales  thereby weakening our competitive position and negatively impacting our results of operations 
medicaid eligible patients and government entities may account for a greater proportion of our acthar unit sales resulting in reduced net sales 
our net sales may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates 
administrative or judicial interpretations of such laws and regulations could also force us to reduce our reimbursement rates or increase the amount of chargebacks paid to certain government entities 
the sources and amounts of our revenues are determined by a number of factors  including the rates of reimbursement among payers 
changes in the payer mix among private pay  medicaid  and government programs usage may significantly affect our profitability 
a portion of the estimated end user vial demand for acthar is for patients covered under medicaid and other government related programs 
as required by federal regulations  we provide rebates related to acthar dispensed to a significant percentage of medicaid patients 
in addition  certain other government supported agencies are permitted to purchase acthar for a nominal amount from our specialty distributor  which then charges the discount back to us 
as a result of these rebates and chargebacks  we do not generate any net sales with respect to sales which are subject to rebates or chargebacks 
as a result of current economic conditions  recently adopted legislation or potential future legislation  it is possible that a greater proportion of acthar sales will be subject to these rebates and chargebacks  reducing our net sales 
additionally  there could be changes to medicaid regulations resulting in higher rebates and chargebacks  which would reduce our net sales further 
the interpretation of laws and regulations may negatively affect the amount we are able to charge government agencies for acthar  or may negatively affect our historical financial results 
for example  on march   the department of defense issued final regulations under the fiscal year national defense authorization act which interpreted such act to expand a government health care program  tricare  to include prescription drugs dispensed by tricare retail network pharmacies 
during the year ended december   we recorded a reserve for million  the total amount of our potential exposure for these tricare claimed rebates 
we may be negatively affected by unforeseen invoicing of historical medicaid sales 
we provide a rebate related to product dispensed to medicaid eligible patients in instances where regulations provide for such a rebate 
the rebate per unit formula is comprised of a basic rebate of applied to the average per unit amount of payments we receive on our product sales and an additional per unit rebate that is based on our current sales price compared to our sales price on an inflation adjusted basis from a designated base period 
we multiply the rebate amount per unit by the estimated rebate units to arrive at the reserve for the period 
this reserve is deducted from gross sales in the determination of net sales 
effective january   the amount we rebate for each acthar vial dispensed to a medicaid eligible patient is approximately  higher than our price to curascript sd 
the medicaid rebates associated with end user demand for a period are mostly paid to the states by the end of the quarter following the quarter in which the rebate reserve is established 
revisions in the medicaid rebate estimates are charged to income in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known 
however  certain states may provide their requested rebates to us on a delayed basis  which would negatively affect future financial performance in periods occurring after the period in which the original reserved medicaid rebate accrual occurred 
for example  in the third quarter of  we received higher than anticipated amounts of medicaid rebates related to prior period acthar usage 
in connection with our receipt of invoices related to these rebates  we increased our rebate reserve which reduced net sales in the third quarter of by approximately million 
we are currently subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 
without considering the impact of any proposed or future health care reform initiatives  no assurance can be given that we will remain in compliance with currently applicable fda and other regulatory requirements for our currently marketed products or any new product once clearance or approval has been obtained 
these requirements include  among other things  regulations regarding manufacturing practices  product labeling and post marketing 
table of contents reporting  including adverse event reports and field alerts due to product quality concerns 
additionally  the facilities and procedures of our suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation  including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country 
a significant percentage of acthar prescriptions is for the treatment of is  which is not an approved indication for acthar 
while physicians may lawfully prescribe acthar for is and other off label uses  any promotion by us of any off label uses would be unlawful 
some of our practices that are intended to respond to questions from physicians with respect to off label uses of acthar without engaging in off label promotion could nonetheless be construed by the fda as off label promotion 
although we have policies and procedures in place designed to help assure ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements regarding off label promotion  some non compliant actions may nonetheless occur or be deemed by regulatory authorities to have occurred 
regulatory authorities could take enforcement action against us if they believe we are promoting or have promoted our products for off label use 
also  the label for acthar includes a list of indications for which acthar has not been actively promoted or prescribed for in several years  if ever 
it is possible that the fda could  in the context of reviewing our snda for is or otherwise  conduct a review of the acthar label and require us to provide data to the fda regarding the safety and efficacy of acthar relating to these indications 
if we are unable to provide such data to the fda  we may be forced to remove those indications 
our inability to market acthar for indications that we were previously able to promote may negatively affect our financial performance 
the regulatory process  which may include extensive pre clinical studies and clinical trials of each product to establish its safety and efficacy  is uncertain  can span many years  and requires the expenditure of substantial time and resources to ensure compliance with complex regulations 
should we fail to comply with applicable regulations  possible regulatory actions could include warning letters  fines  damages  injunctions  civil penalties  recalls  seizures of our products and criminal prosecution 
these actions could result in  among other things  substantial modifications to our business practices and operations  refunds  recalls or a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of our suppliers facilities while our suppliers remedy the alleged violation  the inability to obtain future pre market clearances or approvals  and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market 
any of these events could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition 
in addition  data obtained from pre clinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or clearance 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or clearance for a product 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances could stall the marketing  selling and distribution of any products that we develop  impose significant additional costs on us  diminish any competitive advantages that we may have or develop  and decrease our ability to generate revenues and profits 
regulatory approval  if granted  may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which a new product may be marketed that could limit the potential market for the product 
product approvals  once granted  may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing 
furthermore  manufacturers of approved products are subject to pervasive review  including compliance with detailed regulations governing fda good manufacturing practices 
the fda periodically revises the good manufacturing practices regulations and requires manufacturers to remain current with the latest regulations 
in addition  we cannot predict the extent of governmental regulations or the impact of new governmental regulations that may result in a delay in the development  production and marketing of our products 
as such  we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future laws or regulations 

table of contents other risks associated with our business the loss of our key management personnel or failure to integrate new management personnel could have an adverse impact on future operations 
we are highly dependent on the services of the principal members of our senior management team  and the loss of a member of senior management could create significant disruption in our ability to provide acthar to our customers 
we do not carry key person life insurance for our senior management or other personnel 
additionally  the future potential growth and expansion of our business is expected to place increased demands on our management skills and resources 
recruiting and retaining management and operational personnel to perform sales and marketing  financial operations  business development  clinical development  regulatory affairs  quality assurance  medical affairs and contract manufacturing in the future will also be critical to our success 
we do not know if we will be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced management and operational personnel in the future on acceptable terms given the intense competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for such personnel 
if we are unable to hire necessary skilled personnel in the future  our business could be harmed 
our financial results can be negatively impacted by economic downturns 
downturns in the general economic environment present us with several potential challenges 
in challenging economies and periods of increased unemployment  a greater percentage of our unit volume may be subject to reimbursement under medicaid and other government programs 
this shifting in payer mix can negatively impact our financial results 
in addition  third party payors such as private insurance companies may be less willing to satisfy their reimbursement obligations in a timely matter  or at all 
state and federal reimbursement programs such as medicaid may curtail their reimbursements due to budget cuts 
as a result of downturns in the economy  there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third party contractors  suppliers or collaborators  including curascript 
if curascript is unable to satisfy its commitments to us  our business would be adversely affected 
there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third party manufacturers for acthar 
if such third party manufacturers are unable to satisfy their commitments to us  our business would be adversely affected 
downturns in the capital markets may have a negative impact on the market values of the investments in our investment portfolio 
we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and there can be no assurance that the markets for these securities will not deteriorate or that the institutions that hold these investments will be able to meet their debt obligations at the time we may need to liquidate such investments or until such time as the investments mature 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  we may lose our competitive position and future revenues 
we do not have a patent on acthar 
however  our success will depend in part on our ability to do the following obtain patents for our products and technologies  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we will only be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets and are otherwise protectable under applicable law 
we will attempt to protect our proprietary position by filing us and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary products  technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
the patent positions of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty 
patents  if issued  may be challenged  
table of contents invalidated or circumvented 
thus  any patents that we own or license from third parties for future products may not provide any protection against competitors 
pending patent applications we may file in the future  or those we may license from third parties  may not result in patents being issued 
also  patent rights may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology that we have developed or we will develop 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in addition to patents for future products  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how for acthar 
we currently seek protection  in part  through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for proprietary technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information 
the parties may not comply with or may breach these agreements 
furthermore  our trade secrets may otherwise become known to  or be independently developed by  competitors 
our success will further depend  in part  on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
if our activities infringe on patents owned by others  we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against a licensor or us 
should our products or technologies be found to infringe on patents issued to third parties  the manufacture  use and sale of our products could be enjoined  and we could be required to pay substantial damages 
in addition  we  in connection with the development and use of our products and technologies  may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  which may not be made available on terms acceptable to us 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results 
as a result  current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could have a negative market reaction 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to report on  and requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
at december   we were compliant and have implemented an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to continue to comply with these requirements 
accordingly  we continue to incur expenses and will devote management resources to section compliance as necessary 
further  effective internal controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports 
if our internal controls and procedures become ineffective  we may not be able to provide reliable financial reports  our business and operating results could be harmed and current and potential shareholders may not have confidence in our financial reporting 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or we become subject to other forms of litigation  we may incur substantial liabilities and costs and may be required to limit commercialization of our products 
our business exposes us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the manufacturing  testing and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
the use of our currently marketed products or any drug candidates ultimately developed by us or our collaborators in clinical trials may expose us to product liability claims and possible adverse publicity 
under a recent united states supreme court ruling  fda approval of a drug does not prevent the filing of product liability claims in state courts  potentially making it more costly and time consuming to defend against such claims 
product liability insurance for the pharmaceutical industry is generally expensive  if available at all 
we currently have product liability insurance for claims up to million 
however  if we are unable to maintain insurance coverage at acceptable costs  in a sufficient amount  or at all  or if we become subject to a product liability claim  our reputation  stock price and ability to devote the necessary resources to the commercialization of our products could be negatively impacted 
business interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business 
our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses  human error  natural disasters  telecommunications failures  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
in particular  our corporate 
table of contents headquarters is located in the san francisco bay area  which has a history of seismic activity 
we have not established a formal disaster recovery plan  and our back up operations and our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that occur 
a significant business interruption could result in losses or damages incurred by us and require us to cease or curtail our operations 
risks related to our common stock our stock price has a history of volatility  and an investment in our stock could decline in value 
the price of our common stock is subject to significant volatility 
the closing price per share of our common stock ranged in value from to during the two year period ended december  any number of events  both internal and external to us  may continue to affect our stock price 
for example  our quarterly revenues or earnings or losses can fluctuate based on the buying patterns of our specialty distributor and our end users 
in the event that patient demand for acthar is less than our sales to our specialty distributor  excess acthar inventories may result at our specialty distributor and end users  which may impact future acthar sales 
other potential events that could affect our stock price include  without limitation  our quarterly and yearly revenues and earnings or losses  our ability to acquire and market appropriate pharmaceuticals  announcement by us or our competitors regarding product development efforts  including the status of regulatory approval applications  the outcome of legal proceedings  including claims filed by us against third parties to enforce our patents and claims filed by third parties against us relating to patents held by the third parties  the launch of competing products  our ability to obtain product from our contract manufacturers  the resolution of or failure to resolve disputes with collaboration partners and corporate restructuring by us 
we have significant stock option overhang which could dilute your investment 
we have a substantial overhang of common stock due to a low average exercise price of employee stock options 
the future exercise of employee stock options could cause substantial dilution  which may negatively affect the market price of our shares 
we have certain anti takeover provisions in place 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and the california general corporation law could discourage a third party from acquiring  or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  control of our company without approval of our board of directors 
these provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
certain provisions allow the board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock 
we are also subject to section e of the california general corporation law  which  among other things  limits the ability of a majority shareholder holding more than but less than of the outstanding shares of a california corporation from consummating a cash out merger 
the provisions in our articles of incorporation and provisions of the california general corporation law may discourage  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us

the tax benefits resulting from the reversal of the valuation allowance reduced our income tax expense in the quarters ended june  and december  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this annual report and the statements regarding forward looking information and the factors that could affect our future financial performance described below in this annual report 
the discussion below in this item of this annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the act 
those sections of the act and act provide a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their financial performance so long as they provide meaningful  cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from projected results 
forward looking statements often include the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  estimate  project  or words of similar meaning  or future or conditional verbs such as will  would  should  could  or may 
any statements as to our expectations or beliefs concerning  or projections or forecasts of  our future financial performance or future financial condition  or with respect to trends in our business or in our markets  are forward looking statements 
factors that could affect our future operating results and cause them to differ  possibly significantly  from those currently anticipated are described in i item a  entitled risk factors  in part i of this annual report  and ii the subsection entitled critical accounting policies and use of estimates in item below and  accordingly  the descriptions of the risk factors and the critical accounting policies and use of estimates in this annual report should be read in their entirety 
overview we are a pharmaceutical company focused on diseases and disorders for which there is significant unmet medical need 
our primary drug is hp acthar gel repository corticotropin injection  an injectable drug that is approved by the us food and drug administration fda for the treatment of a variety of diseases and disorders 
since  we have sought to identify diseases and disorders in which the use of acthar could improve patient outcomes 
among the many indications for which it is approved  acthar is approved for the treatment of exacerbations associated with multiple sclerosis ms and  in  we identified a subset of the ms patient population who do not respond to the standard therapies for ms exacerbations as potential candidates for acthar 
in  we significantly expanded our sales force dedicated to the ms market and have experienced strong sales growth in this market 
acthar is also used in treating patients with infantile spasms is  a rare form of refractory childhood epilepsy  and opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome  a rare autoimmune related childhood neurological disorder  but is not approved for the treatment of either disorder 
while we do not promote acthar for the treatment of is  a significant percentage of our net sales is derived from the treatment of this disorder 
acthar is approved to induce a diuresis or a remission of proteinuria in the nephrotic syndrome ns without uremia of the idiopathic type or that due to lupus erythamatosus 
ns is a kidney disorder characterized by high levels of protein in the urine and low levels of protein in the blood that often leads to end stage renal disease 
during the fourth quarter of  we generated a modest amount of net sales as a result of physicians writing prescriptions for acthar to treat ns  and we are working to generate more clinical data to further support the effectiveness of acthar in the treatment of this disorder 
from time to time we receive prescriptions for acthar for other conditions 
we are also in discussions with experts in other disease states with high unmet medical needs for which there is a potential therapeutic role for acthar 
we also market doral quazepam  which is indicated for the treatment of insomnia 
in august  we announced our acthar centric business strategy  which included a new pricing level for acthar effective august  the strategy was adopted in order to best ensure financial viability and continued availability of acthar  establish support programs to benefit acthar patients  advance our product development programs and ensure that the company became economically viable 
since the adoption of the strategy  we have expanded our sponsorship of acthar patient assistance and co pay assistance programs  which provide an important safety net for uninsured and under insured patients using acthar  and have established a group of representatives and medical science liaisons to work with healthcare providers who administer acthar 
we continue to support the acthar patient assistance programs administered by the national organization for rare disorders nord 
these and other patient oriented support programs have now provided free drug with commercial value of over million to patients since september in addition to the free drug program  significant financial support 
table of contents continues to be provided to needy patients through nord s co pay assistance programs that we sponsor 
we have been working closely with the neurology community to identify promising new research projects for which we can provide needed financial support 
we are providing support to leading researchers in their efforts to better understand the underlying disease processes that cause infantile spasms  a subject for which there has been little research funding in recent decades  as well as to better understand the drug s mechanisms of action 
acthar is currently approved in the us for the treatment of ms exacerbations  nephrotic syndrome and many other conditions 
pursuant to guidelines published by the american academy of neurology and the child neurology society  many child neurologists use acthar to treat infants afflicted with is even though it is not approved for this indication 
in december  our supplemental new drug application snda to add the treatment of infantile spasms to the acthar label was accepted for filing by the fda 
the fda has set the user fee goal date  also known as the pdufa date  for action on our filing of june  for this snda 
there can be no assurance that this date will be met or that the snda will be approved 
previously  the fda granted orphan designation to the active ingredient in acthar for the treatment of is 
as a result of this orphan designation  if we are successful in obtaining fda approval for the is indication  we believe we will also qualify for a seven year exclusivity period during which the fda is prohibited from approving any other adrenocorticotropic hormone acth formulation for is unless the other formulation is demonstrated to be clinically superior to acthar or is considered by the fda to have an active ingredient that is different from the active ingredient of acthar 
however  it is unclear what impact the potential approval of our snda may have  as acthar is already used in the treatment of is 
our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors  demand for our products by patients  inventory levels of our products held by third parties  the amount of medicaid rebates on our products dispensed to medicaid eligible patients  the amount of chargebacks and other government rebate programs on the sale of our products by our specialty distributor to government supported entities  the availability of finished goods from our sole source manufacturers  the timing of certain expenses  the timing and amount of our product development expenses  the introduction of a competitive product  and our ability to develop growth opportunities for acthar 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our medicaid rebate obligation related to our products dispensed to medicaid eligible patients  other government rebate programs and chargebacks on sales of our products by wholesalers and our specialty distributor to government supported entities  inventories  intangible assets  share based compensation  lease termination liability and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
sales reserves we have estimated reserves for medicaid rebates to all states for products dispensed to patients covered by medicaid  government chargebacks for sales of our products by wholesalers and our specialty distributor to certain federal government organizations including the veterans administration  and reserves for rebates related to a health coverage program called tricare 
we have also estimated reserves for product returns from our specialty distributor  wholesalers  hospitals and pharmacies 
however  our product returns have been insignificant since gross sales are also reduced for payments made under our acthar patient co payment assistance programs 
we estimate our reserves by utilizing historical information for our existing products and data obtained from external sources 

table of contents significant judgment is inherent in the selection of assumptions and the interpretation of historical experience as well as the identification of external and internal factors affecting the estimates of our reserves for medicaid rebates and other government program rebates and chargebacks 
we believe that the assumptions used to estimate these sales reserves are reasonable considering known facts and circumstances 
however  our medicaid rebates and other government program rebates and chargebacks could differ significantly from our estimates because of unanticipated changes in prescription trends or patterns in the states submissions of medicaid claims  adjustments to the amount of product in the distribution channel  and new interpretations of the medicaid statutes and regulations 
if actual medicaid rebates  or other government program rebates and chargebacks are significantly different from our estimates  such differences would be accounted for in the period in which they become known 
during the quarter ended september   we received higher than anticipated amounts of medicaid rebates related to prior period acthar usage  and we increased our rebate reserve which reduced net sales in the third quarter of by approximately million 
historically  actual amounts have been generally consistent with our estimates 
medicaid rebates we provide a rebate related to product dispensed to medicaid eligible patients in instances where regulations provide for such a rebate 
our a estimated rebate percentage  adjusted for b recent and expected future utilization rates for these programs  is used to estimate the rebate units associated with product shipped during a period as follows a the estimated liability included in sales related reserves as of the end of a period is comprised of the estimated rebate units associated with estimated end user demand during the period  the estimated rebate units associated with estimated inventory in the distribution channel as of the end of the period  and the estimated rebate units  if any  associated with prior rebate periods 
b in order to assess current and future rates of medicaid utilization  we analyze inventory levels received from a third party  curascript sd  patient prescription and shipment data received from a third party  curascript sp  and claims level detail received from state medicaid agencies 
the rebate amount per unit is determined based on a formula established by statute and is subject to review and modification by the administrators of the medicaid program 
the rebate per unit formula is comprised of a basic rebate of applied to the average per unit amount of payments we receive on our product sales and an additional per unit rebate that is based on our current sales price compared to our sales price on an inflation adjusted basis from a designated base period 
we multiply the rebate amount per unit by the estimated rebate units to arrive at the reserve for the period 
this reserve is deducted from gross sales in the determination of net sales 
effective january   the amount we rebate for each acthar vial dispensed to a medicaid eligible patient is approximately  higher than our price to curascript sd 
our acthar rebate amount per unit was approximately of our price to our specialty distributor through august  and increased to of our price to our specialty distributor during the fourth quarter ended december  management believes that the information received from curascript sd related to inventory levels and curascript sp related to prescription and shipment data is reliable  but we are unable to independently verify the accuracy of such data 
the medicaid rebates associated with end user demand for a period are mostly paid to the states by the end of the quarter following the quarter in which the rebate reserve is established 
we routinely assess our experience with medicaid rebates and adjust the reserves accordingly 
revisions in the medicaid rebate estimates are charged to income in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known 
we consider an incremental to percentage point variance to be a reasonably likely change in the percent of medicaid rebates to related gross sales 
an incremental to percentage point change in the estimated rebate units would lead to an approximate million to million effect on net sales and an approximate million to million effect on operating income in in connection with the implementation of our pricing strategy for acthar in august  coupled with clarifications of the medicaid statute in july by program administrators  during we initiated an extensive review of the medicaid statute and regulations 
after such review and consultation with our regulatory legal counsel  we prospectively modified how we determine our rebate amount per unit to conform with the statute 
the 
table of contents modification was implemented in august and communicated to the program administrators in september the modification increased net sales and net income applicable to common shareholders by million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  this sales and income benefit ended during the fourth quarter of the following table summarizes the activity in the account for sales related reserves for medicaid rebates in s balance at january actual medicaid payments for sales made in prior year actual medicaid payments for sales made in current year current medicaid provision for sales made in prior year current medicaid provision for sales made in current year balance at december the increase in the medicaid provision for sales made in primarily results from the increased pricing level for acthar effective august   which resulted in higher rebate amounts 
government chargebacks for the years ended december   and  certain other government supported entities such as the veterans administration and department of defense were permitted to purchase acthar from curascript sd for a nominal amount 
curascript sd charges the significant discount back to us and reduces subsequent payment to us by the amount of the approved chargeback 
the chargeback approximates our sales price to our customers 
as a result  we recognize nominal  if any  net sales on shipments to these entities that qualify for the government chargeback 
effective january   we established new prices for acthar purchased by veterans administration medical centers 
sales recorded in on shipments to the veterans administration will represent an increase as compared to the nominal net sales recognized in the reduction to gross sales for a period related to chargebacks is comprised of actual approved chargebacks originating during the period and an estimate of chargebacks in the ending inventory of our customers 
in estimating the government chargeback reserve as of the end of a period  we estimate the amount of chargebacks in our customers ending inventory using actual average monthly chargeback amounts and ending inventory balances provided by our largest customers 
chargebacks are generally applied by customers against their payments to us approximately to days after they have provided appropriate documentation to confirm their sale to a qualified government supported entity 
we routinely assess the chargeback estimates and adjust the reserves accordingly 
revisions in chargeback estimates are charged to income in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known 
a change in the chargeback estimates would not have a material effect on our sales or operating income 
the following table summarizes the activity in the account for sales related reserves for government chargebacks in s balance at january actual chargeback payments for sales made in prior year actual chargeback payments for sales made in current year current chargeback provision for sales made in prior year current chargeback provision for sales made in current year balance at december 
table of contents tricare rebates we have established a reserve for rebates related to a health coverage program called tricare 
on march   the department of defense issued final regulations under the fiscal year national defense authorization act which interpreted such act to expand tricare to include prescription drugs dispensed by tricare retail network pharmacies 
our tricare rebate reserve reflects this program expansion and is based on estimated department of defense eligible sales multiplied by the tricare rebate formula 
during the year ended december   we recorded a reserve for million  the total amount of our potential exposure for these tricare claimed rebates 
effective january   we established new prices for acthar purchased by tricare 
sales recorded in on shipments to tricare will represent an increase as compared to the nominal net sales recognized in the following table summarizes the activity in the account for sales related reserves for tricare rebates in s balance at january actual tricare rebate payments for sales made in prior year actual tricare rebate payments for sales made in current year current tricare rebate provision for sales made in prior year current tricare rebate provision for sales made in current year balance at december co pay assistance programs we sponsor co pay assistance programs for acthar patients which are administered by the national organization for rare disorders nord 
the payments made under our co pay assistance programs are accounted for as a reduction of gross sales 
product returns we supply replacement product to curascript sd on product returned between one month prior to expiration to three months post expiration 
returns from product lots are exchanged for replacement product  and estimated costs for such exchanges  which include actual product material costs and related shipping charges  are included in cost of sales 
product returns have been insignificant since we began utilizing the services of curascript sd to distribute acthar 
shelf stock adjustment credit under our distribution agreement with curascript sd  if the price of acthar is reduced  curascript sd will receive a shelf stock adjustment credit based upon the amount of product in their inventory at the time of the price reduction 
any reduction in the selling price of acthar is at our discretion 
to date  there have been no such price reductions 

table of contents at december  and  sales related reserves included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were as follows december  in s medicaid rebates government chargebacks tricare rebates product returns credit memoranda policy product returns product replacement policy inventories as of december  our net raw material and finished goods inventories totaled million 
we maintain inventory reserves primarily for excess and obsolete inventory due to the expiration of shelf life of a product 
in estimating inventory excess and obsolescence reserves  we analyze i the expiration date  ii our sales forecasts  and iii historical demand 
judgment is required in determining whether the forecasted sales information is sufficiently reliable to enable us to reasonably estimate excess and obsolete inventory 
if actual future usage and demand for our products is less favorable than projected  additional inventory write offs may be required in the future which would increase our cost of sales in the period of any write offs 
customer inventories may be compared to both internal and external databases to determine adequate inventory levels 
we may monitor our product shipments to customers and compare these shipments against prescription demand for our individual products 
additionally  inventory write offs can occur as a result of manufacturing problems 
for example  during the third quarter of  a manufactured lot of acthar did not meet specifications 
as a result  we recorded a charge of approximately  related to that manufactured lot 
intangible and long lived assets as of december  our intangible and long lived assets consisted of goodwill of  generated from a merger in  net purchased technology of million related to our acquisition of doral and  of net property and equipment 
the costs related to our acquisition of doral are being amortized over an estimated life of years 
the determination of whether or not our intangible and long lived assets are impaired and the expected useful lives of purchased technology involves significant judgment 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require a write down of our recorded asset balances and a reduction in the expected useful life of our purchased technology 
such a write down of our recorded asset balances or reduction in the expected useful life of our purchased technology would increase our operating expenses 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other formerly sfas no 
 we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a possible impairment may have occurred 
our fair value is compared to the carrying value of our net assets  including goodwill 
if the fair value is greater than the carrying amount  then no impairment is indicated 
in accordance with asc  property plant and equipment formerly sfas no 
 we review long lived assets  consisting of property and equipment and purchased technology  for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the net undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the use or disposition of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  the assets carrying value is adjusted to fair value 
as of december  and  no impairment had been indicated 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation formerly sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of asc  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair 
table of contents value of the award and is recognized as expense  net of estimated pre vesting forfeitures  ratably over the vesting period of the award 
we selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate fair value method for our awards 
calculating share based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the share based awards  stock price volatility  and pre vesting forfeitures 
we estimated the expected term of stock options granted for the years ended december  and based on the historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the share based awards  vesting schedules and the expectations of future employee behavior 
we estimated the expected term of stock options granted for the year ended december  based on the simplified method provided in staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
we estimated the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected pre vesting forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the pre vesting forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
our net income for the year ended december  reflected million of share based compensation expense related to employees and non employee members of our board of directors  of which  was related to our employee stock purchase plan espp 
our net income for the year ended december  reflected million of share based compensation expense related to employees and non employee members of our board of directors  of which million was related to our espp 
in february  our board of directors approved a reduction in the offering period of the espp from months to months effective with the offering period that began on september   eliminated the ability of plan participants to increase their contribution levels during an offering period and authorized the addition of  shares to the espp 
in addition  our board of directors approved an amendment in april to permanently reduce the maximum offering period available from months to months and to permanently remove the ability of espp participants to increase their contributions during an offering period 
these amendments to the espp were approved by shareholders at our annual meeting 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested grants of stock options and awards of restricted stock is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
lease termination liability we entered into an agreement to sublease laboratory and office space  including laboratory equipment  at our hayward  california facility in july  due to the termination of our then existing drug discovery programs 
the sublease on our hayward facility expired in july our obligations under the hayward master lease extend through november during the fourth quarter of  the sublessee notified us that they did not intend to extend the sublease beyond the end of july we determined that there was no loss associated with the hayward facility when we initially subleased the space  as we expected cash inflows from the sublease to exceed our rent cost over the term of the master lease 
however  we reevaluated this in when the sublessee notified us that it would not be renewing the sublease beyond july as a result  we computed a loss and liability on the sublease in the fourth quarter of in accordance with asc  leases which now includes former fin and ftb 
as of december  and  the estimated liability related to the hayward facility totaled  and million  respectively  and is included in lease termination liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of the liability was determined using a credit adjusted risk free rate to discount the estimated future net cash flows  consisting of the minimum lease payments under the master lease  net of estimated sublease rental income that could reasonably be obtained from the property 
the most significant assumption in estimating the lease termination liability relates to our estimate of future sublease income 
we base our estimate of sublease income  in part  on the opinion of independent real estate experts  current market conditions  and rental rates  among other factors 

table of contents adjustments to the lease termination liability will be required if actual sublease income differs from amounts currently expected 
we review all assumptions used in determining the estimated liability quarterly and revise our estimate of the liability to reflect changes in circumstances 
effective november   we subleased  square feet of the facility through april and effective february  we subleased the remaining  square feet through the remainder of the term of the master lease 
the  square foot sublease is being leased on a month to month basis subsequent to april these subleases cover a portion of our lease commitment  and all of our insurance  taxes and common area maintenance 
as of december   we are obligated to pay rent on the hayward facility of million 
over the remaining term of the master lease we anticipate that we will receive approximately million in sublease income to be used to pay a portion of our hayward facility obligation 
we are also required to recognize an on going accretion expense representing the difference between the undiscounted net cash flows and the discounted net cash flows over the remaining term of the hayward master lease using the interest method 
the accretion amount represents an on going adjustment to the estimated liability 
the on going accretion expense and any revisions to the liability are recorded in selling  general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
during the years ended december   and we recognized total expense of   and million  respectively  related to the hayward facility 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets  which is ultimately dependent upon us generating future taxable income 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if it is not considered more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets  we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
changes in the valuation allowance based on our assessment will result in an income tax benefit if the valuation allowance is decreased and an income tax expense if the valuation allowance is increased 
based on taxable income for  cumulative taxable income for the three most recent years  and anticipated taxable income for  we reversed the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in that we believed would be recovered based on anticipated taxable income in in  we reversed the remaining valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that we believed would be recovered based on anticipated taxable income in and future years 
these reversals resulted in an income tax benefit of million in and million in which reduced our income tax expense 
any changes in the valuation allowance based upon our future assessment will result in an income tax expense if the valuation allowance is increased 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  and federal and california research and development tax credits of  and  respectively 
federal net operating loss carryforwards totaling million are subject to annual limitations and will be available from through  as a result of federal ownership change limitations 
of this amount  million of federal net operating loss carryforwards are available to reduce our taxable income 
state net operating loss carryforwards totaling million are subject to annual limitations and are available from through in september  california suspended for two years the ability to use state operating loss carryforwards and certain credit carryforwards to reduce taxable income 
we expect to use these state operating loss carryforwards and certain credit carryforwards after the two year suspension 
the federal and state 
table of contents net operating loss carryforwards and the federal credit carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in the years through  if not utilized 
utilization of our net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may still be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions for ownership changes after december  such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards available as of december  before utilization 
we implemented the provisions of financial interpretation no 
 which is now codified in asc  income taxes  as of january  this resulted in the reversal of fully reserved deferred tax assets totaling  which relate to uncertain tax positions  and the related valuation allowance 
we increased our unrecognized tax benefits by  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these unrecognized tax benefits  if recognized in full  would reduce our income tax expense by  and result in adjustments to other tax accounts  primarily deferred taxes 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total net sales years ended december  increase decrease change in s gross sales deductions from gross sales provision for medicaid rebates provision for chargebacks provision for tricare rebates co payment assistance and other total deductions net sales net sales for the years ended december  and were comprised of our products acthar and doral 
net sales of acthar for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million during the same period in during the year ended december  we shipped  acthar vials to our specialty distributor as compared to  vials shipped during the same period in in addition  a reduction of the discount we provide to our specialty distributor contributed to the increase in acthar gross sales in as compared to the decrease in acthar net sales was due to higher sales reserves in for medicaid rebates  other government program rebates and chargebacks  and co pay assistance programs 
the decrease in net sales resulting from higher sales reserves was partially offset by the continued sequential improvement in sales of acthar in the multiple sclerosis ms market 
sales reserves recorded in for medicaid rebates  other government program rebates and chargebacks  and co pay assistance programs were significantly higher than sales reserves recorded in we provide a rebate related to product dispensed to medicaid eligible patients in instances where regulations provide for such a rebate 
in addition  other government supported entities are permitted to purchase our products for a nominal amount from our customers who charge back the significant discount to us 
these medicaid rebates and other government program rebates and chargebacks are estimated by us each quarter and reduce our gross sales in the determination of our net sales 
in addition  as a result of a new assessment of our liability under a department of defense regulation  
table of contents we recorded an additional rebate reserve which reduced net sales by million for rebates related to a health coverage program called tricare 
for the year ended december   to determine our net sales  acthar gross sales were reduced by approximately to account for the estimated amount of medicaid rebates and government chargebacks  as compared to approximately for the year ended december  effective january   the amount we rebate for each acthar vial dispensed to a medicaid eligible patient is approximately  higher than our price to our specialty distributor 
we completed the second phase of our sales force expansion during the first quarter of  and a third sales force expansion to representatives was completed during the third quarter of the sales force expansion supports our increased sales efforts related to the use of acthar for the treatment of exacerbations associated with ms  an indication for which acthar is already approved 
our increased sales efforts have resulted in a significant increase in sales of acthar to treat select ms exacerbation patients in as compared to these sales efforts and our initiatives to educate ms specialists about the treatment benefits of acthar have resulted in a year over year increase in new paid commercial ms prescriptions 
a lesser percentage of adults than infants are eligible for medicaid 
as a result  fewer ms patients than is patients participate in the medicaid program 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of we received a modest set of acthar prescriptions for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome ns which is an indication for which acthar is already approved 
there can be no guarantee that any of these growth trends will continue 
acthar orders may be affected by several factors  including inventory levels at specialty and hospital pharmacies  greater use of patient assistance programs  the overall pattern of usage by the health care community  including medicaid and government supported entities  the use of alternative therapies for the treatment of is  and the reimbursement policies of insurance companies 
our specialty distributor ships acthar to specialty pharmacies and hospitals to meet end user demand 
we track our own acthar shipments daily  but those shipments vary compared to end user demand because of seasonal usage and changes in inventory levels at specialty pharmacies and hospitals 
we also review the amount of inventory of acthar at curascript sd and doral at wholesalers in order to help assess the demand for our products 
acthar shipments may be affected by seasonality as well as quarter to quarter fluctuations driven by the relatively small is patient population 
we believe these fluctuations are principally due to the low incidence of is  as a relatively small number of cases can create meaningful fluctuations 
we will continue to monitor these factors as there may be volatility in our acthar shipments and end user demand in future periods 
cost of sales and gross profit years ended december  increase decrease change in s cost of sales gross profit gross margin cost of sales for the year ended december  was consistent with cost of sales for the year ended december  cost of sales includes material costs  packaging  warehousing and distribution  product liability insurance  royalties  quality control which primarily includes product stability testing  quality assurance and reserves for excess or obsolete inventory 
stability testing is required on each production lot of acthar and is conducted at third party laboratories at periodic intervals subsequent to manufacturing 
stability testing costs are expensed as incurred 
we incur a royalty of on total net sales of acthar to a third party and a royalty of of annual net sales over million to an additional third party 
decreases in distribution costs and royalties on acthar were offset by an increase in inventory obsolescence totaling approximately  during the third quarter of  a manufactured lot of acthar did not meet specifications 
as a result  we recorded a charge of approximately  related to that manufactured lot 

table of contents the gross margin was for each of the years ended december  and selling  general and administrative years ended december  increase decrease change in s selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased million as compared to the same period in the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was due primarily to an increase in headcount related costs and costs associated with the support of our acthar strategy
