item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were founded in and completed an initial public offering of common stock in we develop and market telecommunications services for internet protocol  or ip  telephony and video applications as well as web based conferencing and unified communications services 
we offer the x voip voice over internet protocol voice and video digital phone service  x virtual office hosted pbx service  x complete contact center service  x trunking service  x hosted key system service  x mobiletalk service  x virtual meeting web conferencing service  the x virtual office pro unified communications solution and x managed hosting and cloud based computing solutions 
as of march   we had more than  business customers 
each business customer subscribes to a number of various lines and services eg physical phone extensions  virtual extensions  fax lines  toll free numbers  receptionist software  unified communications services  etc 
since fiscal  substantially all of our revenues have been generated from the sale  license and provision of voip products  services and technology 
prior to fiscal  our focus was on our voip semiconductor business 
critical accounting policies estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
these policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual future results may differ from our estimates 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to bad debts  valuation of inventories  and litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additional information regarding risk factors that may impact our estimates is included above under item a  risk factors 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
under the terms of our typical subscription agreement  new customers can terminate their service within days of order placement and receive a full refund of fees previously paid 
we have determined that we have sufficient history of subscriber conduct to make a reasonable estimate of cancellations within the day trial period 
therefore  we recognize new subscriber revenue in the month in which the new order was shipped  net of an allowance for expected cancellations 
financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc formerly emerging issues task force consensus no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables requires that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet specific criteria 
in addition  arrangement consideration must be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with certain limitations 
the provisioning of the x service with the accompanying x ip telephone constitutes a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with the guidance of asc  we allocate x revenues  including activation fees  among the x ip telephones and subscriber services 
revenues allocated to these devices are recognized as product revenues during the period of the sale less the allowance for estimated returns during the day trial period 
all other revenues are recognized when the related services are provided 
we record revenue net of any sales related taxes that are billed to our customers 
we believe this approach results in financial statements that are more easily understood by investors 
the cost of the products sold is recognized contemporaneously with the recognition of revenue 
at the time of each revenue transaction  we assess whether the revenue amount is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we defer recognition of revenue on product sales to retailers where the right of return exists until products are resold to the end user and the trial period has expired 
during fiscal  and  revenue from software licensing and related arrangements were limited 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we have allocated revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
this means that we defer revenue from the arranged fee that is equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations for our technology licenses are based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
we base the fair value of services  such as training or consulting  on separate sales of these services to other customers 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates  and we generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
under our revenue recognition accounting principles  if a software license arrangement includes acceptance criteria  we do not recognize revenue until we can demonstrate objectively that the software or service can meet the acceptance criteria or that the customer has signed formal acceptance documentation 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver unspecified future products  we recognize revenue on a subscription basis  ratably over the term of the contract 
for all sales  except those completed via the internet  we use either a binding purchase order or other signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement  and recognize revenue upon settlement of the transaction  if there are no customer acceptance conditions 
we do not settle credit card transactions until equipment related to the transaction  if any  is shipped to a customer 
we launched the retail channel in fiscal and began using it for our x virtual office service in with product offerings through office depot and subsequently office max 
our retail channels and online retailers have unlimited return rights for this equipment 
the company records shipments to distributors  retailers  and resellers  where the right of return exists  as deferred revenue 
consequently  we defer recognition of revenue on sales to distributors  retailers  and resellers where the right of return exists until products are resold to the end user 
our ability to enter into revenue generating transactions and recognize revenue in the future is subject to a number of business and economic risks discussed above under item a  risk factors 
collectability of accounts receivable we must make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  including historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of march   the accounts receivable balance was  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  including a reserve for disputed credits  and an estimated returns reserve of  if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
valuation of inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions and replacement costs 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
acquired product rights on april   we resolved a patent litigation matter with web telephony by entering into a license and settlement agreement that resolved all legal claims by web telephony 
as part of the settlement  we agreed to pay eight quarterly payments totaling  over the next two years between april and december under the transaction  we expensed  of the patent settlement costs during the year ended march  that were related to benefits received by us in and during the periods prior to fiscal year we recorded the remaining license fee of  as other long term assets as of march  and we are amortizing this amount to cost of service revenues in the consolidated statements of operations over the remaining life of the primary patent  which expires in september warrant liability we account for our warrants in accordance with asc formerly emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company s own stock which requires warrants to be classified as permanent equity  temporary equity or as assets or liabilities 
in general  warrants that either require net cash settlement or are presumed to require net cash settlement are recorded as assets and liabilities at fair value and warrants that require settlement in shares are recorded as equity instruments 
certain of our warrants require settlement in shares and are accounted for as permanent equity 
we also have two investor warrants that are classified as liabilities because they include a provision that specifies that we must deliver freely tradable shares upon exercise by the warrant holder 
because there are circumstances  irrespective of likelihood  which may not be within our control that could prevent delivery of registered shares  asc requires the warrants be recorded as a liability at fair value  with subsequent changes in fair value recorded as income loss in change in fair value of warrant liability 
the fair value of the warrant is determined using a black scholes option pricing model  and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including our stock price  expected stock price volatility and contractual term 
the amount we record as a liability under asc is not  nor do we intend for it to be an admission or stipulation of the amount that we would owe or be obligated to pay the warrant holder in the event of an actual breach by us of the warrant terms 
in fact  we have made no determination of the amount of liability  if any  that we would owe to the warrant holder in the event of such a breach 
income and other taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax expense and to assess temporary differences resulting from book tax accounting differences for items such as deferred revenue 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
significant management judgment is required to determine the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets  which consist of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million as of march   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize most of our deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
we have received inquiries  demands or audit requests from several states and municipal taxing and agencies seeking payment of taxes that are applied to or collected from the customers of providers of traditional public switched telephone network services 
we have recorded an expense of   and  for the years ended march   and  respectively  as our estimate of the increase in probable tax exposure for such assessments 
our cumulative estimate for probable assessments is million as of march   which is recorded in the accrued taxes line item in the consolidated balance sheets 
stock based compensation we account for our employee stock options and stock purchase rights granted under the stock plan  director option plan  nonstatutory stock option plan and the stock plan and stock purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plan purchase plan under the provisions of asc stock compensation formerly statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment 
under the provisions of asc  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant  net of estimated forfeitures 
we have adopted the modified prospective transition method as provided by asc and  accordingly  financial statement amounts for the prior periods have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal and included both the unvested portion of stock based awards granted prior to april  and stock based awards granted subsequent to april  stock options granted in periods prior to fiscal were measured based on asc formerly sfas no 
criteria  whereas stock options granted subsequent to april  were measured based on asc formerly sfas no 
r criteria 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we changed our method of attributing the value of stock based compensation to expense from the accelerated multiple option approach to the straight line single option method 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted subsequent to april  has been recognized using the straight line single option method 
stock based compensation expense included in fiscal included the impact of estimated forfeitures 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
to value option grants and stock purchase rights under the purchase plan for actual and pro forma stock based compensation we used the black scholes option valuation model 
fair value determined using the black scholes option valuation model varies based on assumptions used for the expected stock prices volatility  expected life  risk free interest rates and future dividend payments 
for fiscal years  and  we used the historical volatility of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the options to their fair value 
the expected life assumptions represent the weighted average period stock based awards are expecting to remain outstanding 
these expected life assumptions were established through the review of historical exercise behavior of stock based award grants with similar vesting periods 
the risk free interest was based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded us treasury securities in the over the counter market for the expected term equal to the expected term of the option 
the dividend yield assumption was based on our history and expectation of future dividend payout 
asc requires us to calculate the additional paid in capital pool apic pool available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to adopting asc  as if we had adopted asc at its effective date of january  there are two allowable methods to calculate our apic pool the long form method as set forth in asc or the short form method as set forth in asc formerly fasb staff position no 
r 
we have elected to use the long form method under which we track each award grant on an employee by employee basis and grant by grant basis to determine if there is a tax benefit or tax deficiency for such award 
we then compared the fair value expense to the tax deduction received for each grant and aggregated the benefits and deficiencies to establish the apic pool 
due to the adoption of asc  some exercises result in tax deductions in excess of previously recorded benefits based on the option value at the time of grant  or windfalls 
we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  we are not recognizing deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from windfall tax benefits occurring from april  onward 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by the company upon an employee s disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that the company had recorded 
we use the with and without approach as described in asc formerly emerging issues task force eitf topic no 
d  in determining the order in which our tax attributes are utilized 
the with and without approach results in the recognition of the windfall stock option tax benefits only after all other tax attributes of ours have been considered in the annual tax accrual computation 
also  we have elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of share based compensation deductions in computing our research and development tax and as such  we recognize the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs 
on january   when our stock price closed at per share our board of directors approved the acceleration of unvested stock options to purchase  shares of common stock 
 of these shares are subject to options held by our executive officers and directors 
these options of our executive officers and directors  taken as a whole  have a weighted average exercise price of per share and range from to per share  and a weighted average remaining vesting term of years 
approximately million of the million stock based compensation charge in the fourth quarter of applies to the options held by our executive officers and directors 
selected operating statistics we periodically review certain key business metrics  within the context of our articulated performance goals  in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business

business customer churn is calculated by dividing the number of business customers that terminated after the expiration of the day trial during that period by the simple average number of business customers during the period and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of business customers during the period is the number of business customers on the first day of the period plus the number of business customers on the last day of the period divided by two 
business customers are defined as customers paying for service 
customers that have prepaid for their first month of service and are currently in the day trial period are considered to be customers that are paying for service 
business customer average monthly service revenue per customer is service revenue from business customers in the period divided by the number of months in the period divided by the simple average number of business customers during the period 
total business  residential and video subscriber acquisition cost per service is defined as the combined costs of advertising  marketing  promotions  commissions and equipment subsidies during the period divided by the number of gross services added during the period 
business subscriber acquisition cost per service is defined as the combined costs of advertising  marketing  promotions  commissions and equipment subsidies for business services sold during the period divided by the number of gross business services added during the period 
the addition of  avtex customers that migrated to x in the second fiscal quarter of but subscribed to find me  follow me services rather than x virtual office service  and the  in expense related to the acquisition of these  customers  is excluded from this calculation 
business customer subscriber acquisition cost is business subscriber acquisition cost per service times the average number of services subscribed to per business customer 
we believe it is useful to monitor these metrics together and not individually  as we do not make business decisions based upon any single metric 
results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

we expect that x service revenues will continue to comprise nearly all of our service revenues for the foreseeable future 
the increase in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  was primarily attributable to a million increase in x service revenues resulting from the growth of our business service subscriber base 
our business service subscriber base grew from approximately  customers at the end of fiscal to approximately  customers on march  the increase was offset by a decrease of million attributable to residential services 
the decrease in service revenues from residential customers resulted from a reduction in the number of residential lines in service 
these changes are consistent with the redirection of most of our marketing efforts toward our business customer service and we expect the trends to continue in future periods

income on change in fair value of warrant liability years ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands income loss on change in fair value of warrant liability  percentage of total revenues in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock in fiscal and  we issued warrants in three different equity financings 
the warrants included a provision that we must deliver freely tradable shares upon exercise of the warrant 
because there are circumstances that may not be within our control that could prevent delivery of registered shares  asc requires the warrants be recorded as a liability at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recorded as a gain or loss 
the fair value of the warrant is determined using a black scholes option pricing model  and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including our stock price  expected stock price volatility and contractual term 
to the extent that the fair value of the warrant liability increases or decreases  we record a loss or income in our statement of operations 
the amount we record as a liability under asc is not  nor do we intend for it to be  an admission or stipulation of the amount that we would owe or be obligated to pay the warrant holder in the event of an actual breach by us of the warrant terms 
in fact  we have made no determination of the amount of liability  if any  that we would owe to the warrant holder in the event of such a breach 
the decrease in the income from change in fair value of warrants in fiscal from fiscal occurred because the fair value of warrants and warrant liability increased due to an increase in our stock price and the expected stock price volatility  offset by a reduction in the risk free interest rate and contractual life of the warrants  which are the primary assumptions applied to the black scholes model which we have used to calculate the fair value of the warrants

the federal credit carryforwards will begin expiring in continuing through  while the california credit will carry forward indefinitely 
under the ownership change limitations of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the amount and benefit from the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
at march  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
because of uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets  we have applied a full valuation allowance as of march  and liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
by comparison  at march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we currently have no borrowing arrangements 
to net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million  compared with million provided by operating activities for fiscal the increase in cash flow was primarily due to a decline in third party network service expenses and a decline in stock based compensation expense  offset partially by discounting of equipment sold to business service customers during fiscal cash used in or provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income  sales of subscriptions  changes in working capital accounts  particularly in deferred revenue due to timing of annual plan renewals  add backs of non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization  and the expense associated with stock based awards 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million provided by investing activities in fiscal the decrease in cash flow from investing activities during fiscal is primarily related to the investment of operating cash balances 
our financing activities for fiscal provided cash of million from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans which was offset by million used to repurchase shares of common stock under our share repurchase plan 
our financing activities for fiscal provided cash of million from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
to net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million  compared with million provided by operating activities for fiscal the decrease in cash flow was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation  which includes million due to the acceleration of unvested employee stock options in january  a million provision for inventory primarily due to million of excess inventory related to our business services analog phone  a million provision for doubtful accounts primarily related to royalty revenue  and a million write off of our legacy billing system  offset partially by a million increase in other current and noncurrent liabilities primarily due to a license and settlement agreement 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million provided by investing activities in fiscal the increase in cash flow from investing activities during fiscal is primarily related to maturity of short term investment 
our financing activities for fiscal provided cash of million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plans 
our financing activities for fiscal provided cash of million from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
although we have achieved positive cash flows from operations in the fiscal year ended march  and  historical net losses and negative cash flows have been funded primarily through the issuance of equity securities and borrowings 
based on our current expectations  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash expected to be generated from future operations  will be sufficient to satisfy our expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
nevertheless  our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount of revenue we generate  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new services or products  the costs to ensure access to our telecommunications services  the continuing market acceptance of our service and products and the extent to which we use our cash to acquire other businesses 
however  if we do not meet our plan  we could be required  or might elect  to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us at all 
we also might decide to raise additional capital at such times and upon such terms as management considers favorable and in our interests  but we cannot be assured that our capital raising efforts will be successful 
contractual obligations future operating lease payments  capital lease payments and purchase obligations at march  for the next five years were as follows in thousands year ending march  total capital leases office leases  license fee purchase obligations third party customer support provider  open purchase orders  in march and august  we entered into a series of noncancelable capital lease agreements for office equipment bearing interest at various rates 
assets under capital lease at march  totaled  with accumulated amortization of  on may   we entered into a three year lease for a new primary facility in sunnyvale  california that expires in fiscal the facility leases include rent escalation clauses and require us to pay utilities and normal maintenance costs 
rent expense is reflected in our consolidated financial statements on a straight line basis over the term of the leases 
in the third quarter of  we amended our contract with one of our third party customer support vendors containing a minimum monthly commitment of approximately  the agreement requires a day notice to terminate 
at march   the total remaining obligation under the contract was million 
at march  we had open purchase orders of million  primarily related to inventory purchases from our contract manufacturers 
these purchase commitments are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these goods or services 
at march   we had a  liability related to warrants issued to two investors in an equity financing transaction in fiscal the warrants expire in december we account for these warrants as liabilities because of the possibility  however likely or unlikely  that we would be unable to deliver registered shares upon a future exercise of these warrants 
the required accounting for a warrant with an assumed net cash settlement provision under asc is to estimate the fair value on the date of issuance and to record a liability equal to that value with subsequent changes in the fair value recorded as income or expense at the end of each reporting period 
the amount we record as a liability under asc is not  nor do we intend for it to be  an admission or stipulation of the amount that we would owe or be obligated to pay the warrant holder in the event that we are unable to deliver registered shares to the warrant holder 
in fact  we have made no determination of the amount of liability  if any  that we would owe to the warrant holder in the event of such a breach 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued an amendment to asc subsequent events formerly sfas no 
 subsequent events 
the statement is to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
asc was effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operation and financial condition 
in july  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 topic generally accepted accounting principles  asu which amended asc  generally accepted accounting principles  to establish the codification as the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
on the effective date  the codification superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all previous references to the superseded standards in our consolidated financial statements have been replaced by references to the applicable sections of the codification 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operation and financial condition 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 
asu updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under asc  which originated primarily from the guidance in eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting  and eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration 
in addition  the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
asu will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted provided that the revised guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption 
we are currently assessing the future impact of this new accounting update to our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 
asu amends the scope of pre existing software revenue guidance by removing from the guidance non software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products 
asu will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted provided that the revised guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption 
we are currently assessing the future impact of this new accounting update to our consolidated financial statements 
in january  financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  accounting and reporting for decreases in ownership of a subsidiary a scope clarification 
asu addresses implementation issues related to the changes in ownership provisions in the consolidation overall subtopic subtopic of the fasb asc  originally issued as sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
subtopic establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for noncontrolling interests and changes in ownership interests of a subsidiary 
an entity is required to deconsolidate a subsidiary when the entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in the subsidiary 
upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary  an entity recognizes a gain or loss on the transaction and measures any retained investment in the subsidiary at fair value 
the gain or loss includes any gain or loss associated with the difference between the fair value of the retained investment in the subsidiary and its carrying amount at the date the subsidiary is deconsolidated 
in contrast  an entity is required to account for a decrease in ownership interest of a subsidiary that does not result in a change of control of the subsidiary as an equity transaction 
the adoption of asu did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operation and financial condition 
in january  fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair measurements 
asu provides amendments to subtopic of the fasb accounting standards codification  originally issued as fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements that require separate disclosure of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and the presentation of separate information regarding purchases  sales  issuances and settlements for level fair value measurements 
additionally  asu provides amendments to subtopic that clarify existing disclosures about the level of disaggregation and inputs and valuation techniques 
asu is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after december  we will adopt this pronouncement in the third quarter of fiscal and do not expect the adoption of asu will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operation and financial condition 
in february  fasb issued asu subsequent events topic amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements 
asu amends disclosure requirements within subtopic an entity that is an sec filer is not required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
this change alleviates potential conflicts between subtopic and the sec s requirements 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operation and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we may maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  debt securities and certificates of deposit 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income 
during the years ended march  and  we did not have any outstanding debt instruments other than equipment under capital leases and  therefore  we were not exposed to market risk relating to interest rates
