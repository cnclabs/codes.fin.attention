item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be reasonable given the circumstances 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and require the company to make its most difficult and subjective accounting judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances  which impact the recording of revenues  valuation of inventories  which impacts costs of goods sold and gross margins  accounting for income taxes  which impacts the income tax provision and net income  impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and investments  which impacts the goodwill  intangible asset and investment accounts  and share based compensation  which impacts costs of goods sold and operating expenses 
these policies and the estimates and judgments involved are discussed further below 
we also have other important policies that we discuss in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  the company meets these conditions upon shipment because  in most cases  title and risk of loss passes to the customer at that time 
in addition  the company estimates and records provisions for future returns and other charges against revenue at the time of shipment 
for some of our products  notably our fcps that we manufacture in taiwan  we recognize revenue upon delivery for taiwan sales and for foreign sales  days after shipment 
our sales terms for fcp are usually fob shipping point and we use federal express fedex for all of our deliveries 
fedex delivers shipments within one day to taiwanese customers and within days for customers outside of taiwan 
we sell products to both large domestic and international distributors 
we sell our products to domestic distributors at the price listed in our price book for that distributor 
at the time of shipment  we record a sales reserve for the entire amount if the customer has the right to return the product 
in addition  at the time of sale we record a sales reserve for ship from stock and debits ssd s  stock rotation amounts expected to be returned  return material authorizations rma s  authorized price protection programs  and any special programs approved by management 
these sales reserves offset revenues  which produces the net revenues amount we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the market price for our products can be significantly different from the book price at which we sold the product to the distributor 
when the market price  as compared with the book price  of a particular sales opportunity from our distributor to their customer would result in low or negative margins to our distributor  we negotiate a ship from stock and debit with the distributor 
we analyze our ssd history and use the history to develop ssd rates that form the basis of the ssd sales reserve we record each period 
we use historical ssd rates to estimate the ultimate net sales price to the distributor 
our distribution agreements provide for semi annual stock rotation privileges of typically of net sales for the previous six month period 
the contractual stock rotation applies only to shipments at book price 
asian distributors typically buy our product at less than book price and therefore are not entitled to the stock rotation privilege 
in order to provide for routine inventory refreshing  for our benefit as well as theirs  we typically grant asian distributors stock rotation privileges between and even though we are not contractually obligated to do so 
each month we adjust the sales reserve for the estimated stock rotation privilege anticipated to be utilized by our distributors 
from time to time  customers may request to return parts for various reasons including the customers belief that the parts are not performing to specification 
many such return requests are the result of customers incorrectly using the parts  not because the parts are defective 
our management reviews these requests and  if approved  we establish a rma 
we are only obligated to accept returns of defective parts 
for customer convenience  we may approve a particular return request  even though we are not obligated to do so 
each month  we record a sales reserve for the approved rmas that have not yet been returned 
in the past  we have not kept a general warranty reserve because historically valid warranty returns  which are the result of a part not meeting specifications or being non functional  have been immaterial and frequently we can resell parts to other customers for use in other applications 
we monitor and assess rma activity and overall materiality to assess whether a general warranty reserve has become appropriate 
we grant price protection solely at the discretion of our management 
the purpose of price protection is to reduce our distributors cost of inventory as market prices fall  which reduces our ssd rates 
our sales management team prepares price protection proposals for individual products located at individual distributors 
our general management reviews these proposals and if a particular price protection arrangement is approved  we estimate the dollar impact based on the book price reduction per unit for the products approved and the number of units of those products in that distributor s inventory 
we record a sales reserve in that period for the estimated amount at the time revenue is recognized 
at the discretion of our management  we may offer rebates on specific products sold to specific end customers 
the purpose of the rebates is to allow for pricing adjustments for large programs without affecting the pricing we charge our distributor customers 
we record the customer s rebate at the time of shipment 
customers are typically granted payment terms of between and days and they generally pay within those terms 
we grant relatively few customers any sales terms that include cash discounts 
we invoice our distributors for shipments at our listed book price 
when our distributors pay those invoices  they may claim debits for ssds  stock rotations  cash discounts  rmas and price protection when appropriate 
once claimed  we confirm these debits are in line with our management s prior authorizations and reduce the reserve we previously established for that customer 
the revenue we record for sales to our distributors is net of estimated provisions for these programs 
when determining this net revenue  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience rates  inventory levels in the distribution channel  current trends and other related factors 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
our financial condition and operating results depend on our ability to make reliable estimates and we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and in banks and all highly liquid debt investments with a time to maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase 
short and long term investments 
our policy is to invest excess funds in instruments with investment grade credit ratings 
we classify our investments as available for sale 
further  we classify our available for sale securities as either current or non current based on the specific attributes of each security 
we recognize unrealized gains and losses in our available for sale securities as an increase or reduction in shareholders equity 
we report our available for sale securities at their fair values 
we evaluate our available for sale securities for impairment quarterly 
we recognize the credit portion of an impairment loss as other than temporary decline in the value of investment in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which we discover the impairment 
any non credit portion of an impairment loss is recorded in other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet for the period in which we discover the impairment 
we have also made other investments including loans and bridge loans convertible to equity as well as direct equity investments 
we make these loans and investments with strategic intentions and  historically  are in privately held technology companies  which by their nature are high risk 
these investments are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet and we carry them at the lower of cost  or market if the investment has experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
we monitor these investments quarterly and make appropriate reductions in carrying value if we deem a decline in value is other than temporary 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors 
we record a specific allowance in cases where we become aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to pay fully their financial obligation to us 
for all other customers  we recognize an allowance based on the length of time the receivable balances are past due  based on the current economic environment and our historical experience 
inventories 
for our ic and certain fcp products we record inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we adjust the carrying value of inventory for excess and obsolete inventory based on inventory age  shipment history and our forecast of demand over a specific future period 
the semiconductor markets that we serve are volatile and actual results may vary from our forecast or other assumptions  potentially affecting our assessment of excess and obsolete inventory resulting in material effects on our gross margin 
we record the inventories of the remainder of our fcp products at the lower of weighted average cost which approximates actual cost or market value 
weighted average cost is comprised of average manufacturing costs weighted by the volume produced in each production run 
we define market value as the net realizable value for our finished goods and replacement cost for raw materials and work in process 
we consider raw material inventory slow moving and fully reserve for it if it has not moved in days 
for assembled devices  we disaggregate the inventory by part number 
we compare the quantities on hand in each part number category to the quantity we shipped in the previous twelve months  the quantity in backlog and to the quantity we expect to ship in the next twelve months 
we record a reserve to the extent the value of each quantity on hand is in excess of the lesser of the three comparisons 
in certain circumstances  management will determine  based on expected usage or other factors  that inventory considered excess by these guidelines should not be written off 
the company does occasionally determine that last twelve months sales levels will not continue and reserves inventory in line with the quantity forecasted 
we believe our method of evaluating our inventory fairly represents market conditions 
we consider the material written off to be available for sale 
we do not revalue the written off inventory should market conditions change or if a market develops for the obsolete inventory 
in the past  we have sold obsolete inventory that we have previously written off as worthless 
refer to the gross profit discussion in this item of our annual report on form k for further discussion of sales of our obsolete inventory 
property  plant and equipment 
we record our property  plant and equipment at cost and depreciate the cost over the estimated useful lives of each asset classification  ranging between and years 
cost includes purchase cost  applicable taxes  freight  installation costs and interest incurred in the acquisition of any asset that requires a period of time to make it ready for use 
in addition  we capitalize the cost of major replacements  improvements and betterments  while we expense normal maintenance and repair 
investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
we hold ownership interests in various investees 
our ownership in these affiliates varies from to approximately  which we classify as investments in unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated balance sheets 
we account for long term investments in companies in which we have an ownership share larger than and in which we have significant influence over the activities of the investee using the equity method 
we recognize our proportionate share of each investee s income or loss in the period in which the investee reports the income or loss 
we eliminate all intercompany transactions in accounting for our equity method investments 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we determined that no impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets existed at july  we also evaluate other definite lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
we determined that no impairment indicators for these other definite lived intangible assets existed at july  income taxes 
we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach to recording deferred taxes 
our deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities that will result in deductible amounts in future years  including net operating loss carry forwards 
based on estimates  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
if  in the future  we experiences losses for a sustained period of time  we may not be able to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
if this occurs  we may be required to increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense 
overview we incorporated pericom semiconductor corporation in june in california 
we completed our first profitable fiscal year on june  we design  manufacture and market high performance digital  analog and mixed signal integrated circuits ics and frequency control products fcps used for the transfer  routing and timing of digital and analog signals within and between computer  networking  data communications and telecommunications systems 
our first volume sales occurred in fiscal and consisted exclusively of volt bit interface logic circuits 
we have introduced new products to the market every year since we produced our first shipments 
in recent years  we have expanded our product offering by introducing the following products  among others in fiscal  a total of new products across our timing  signal conditioning  and connectivity product areas  including industry first signal conditioning products specifically designed to meet the stringent specifications of the new  high speed pci express gen gb s  and sata sas gb s protocols  products which have become enabling technology by allowing system designers to maintain critical signal integrity within next generation platforms  industry first display port switches and level shifters  which help enable adoption of the new protocol  in the area of pci express  the industry s first pcie bridge and packet switch products in low cost  small size bga and qfp packages  which help enable the use of pci express in volume platforms such as notebook  docking station  digital tv  and multi function soho printers mfp  and new timing products including industry first extremely low jitter clock oscillators specifically designed for the new pci express gen specification  and in fiscal  we introduced a total of new products across our timing  signal conditioning  and connectivity product areas eight new timing products including one jitter cleaner product  four clock generators buffers for pcie  networking and ultramobility applications  and three multi product families of oscillators the m  xp  and fd series 
the xp oscillators are an industry first hybrid technology providing a high performance  high frequency timing reference for sas  gpon  gigabit ethernet serial connectivity standards  while the fd series oscillators provide a very low jitter  low power  small size solution for hard disk drive and wireless applications 
eight new signal conditioning products including sata  display port  sas  and pcie gen including an industry first pcisig compliant pcie gb s redriver  an industry first esata gb s redriver  and a first to market display port redriver 
twenty four new connectivity products  including usb  display port  pcie  hdmi  ethernet  and lvds switches  and pcie bridges and packet switches including the industry s smallest low power pcie packet switch  and in fiscal  we introduced a total of new products across the signal integrity  timing  and connectivity product areas  including industry leading or industry first product introductions expanding our solutions for high speed serial protocol signal integrity  we introduced new redrivertm products addressing sata  sata sas  usb  and display port protocols 
a number of these products were first to market  especially the usb and display port redrivers 
these products target volume pc  server  storage  embedded  and networking applications 
adding to high speed connectivity solutions  we introduced new switching and connectivity products across pcie  usb  vga  hdmi  and display port protocols 
the pcie to usb pcie product is the first to combine bridging and switching of multiple high speed serial protocols  while a unique family of usb sleep and charge products were also first to market with the highest level of integration for a nb usb port charger ic 
these products target the computing  server  networking  and embedded market segments 
expanding our timing solutions for next generation platforms  we introduced new products across crystal  xo  clock generator  and clock buffer product families 
included is an industry leading assp xo family of most popular platform frequency products  and a new family of very small crystals for ultra mobility products such as cell phones and smart cards 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we expect selling prices for our products to decline over the life of each product 
our ability to increase net revenues is highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in selling prices of existing products 
in order to have sufficient supply for increased unit sales  we seek to increase the wafer fabrication capacity allocations from our existing foundries  qualify new foundries  increase the number of die per wafer through die size reductions and improve the yields of good die through the implementation of advanced process technologies 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
magnachip and globalfoundries manufactured over of the wafers for our semiconductor products in fiscal years  and  with the balance coming from between three and six other suppliers 
declining selling prices will adversely affect gross margins unless we are able to offset such declines with the sale of new  higher margin products or achieve commensurate reductions in unit costs 
we seek to improve our overall gross margin through the development and introduction of selected new products that we believe will ultimately achieve higher gross margins 
a higher gross margin for a new product is typically not achieved until some period after the initial introduction of the product after start up expenses for that product have been incurred and once volume production begins 
in general  costs are higher at the introduction of a new product due to the use of a more generalized design schematic  lower economy of scale in the assembly phase and lower die yield 
our ability to reduce unit cost depends on our ability to shrink the die sizes of our products  improve yields  obtain favorable subcontractor pricing and make in house manufacturing operations more productive and efficient 
there can be no assurance that these efforts  even if successful  will be sufficient to offset declining selling prices 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended july  june  june  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring charge total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income  net interest expense other than temporary decline in value of investment income before income taxes income tax expense net income from consolidated companies equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates net income net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to pericom shareholders comparison of fiscal  and net revenues the following table sets forth our revenues and the customer concentrations with respect to such revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended fiscal year ended july  june  june  june  in thousands change change net revenues percentage of net revenues accounted for by top direct customers number of direct customers that each account for more than of net revenues percentage of net revenues accounted for by top end customers number of end customers that each account for more than of net revenues direct customers purchase products directly from the company 
these customers include distributors and contract manufacturers that in turn sell to many end customers as well as oems that also purchase directly from the company 
end customers are oems whose products include the company s products 
end customers may purchase directly from the company or from distributors or contract manufacturers 
for end customer sales data  we rely on the end customer data provided by our direct distribution and contract manufacturing customers 
net revenues consist of product sales  which we generally recognize upon shipment  less an estimate for returns and allowances 
our order backlog stood at million as of july  and million as of june  we expect to fulfill most of our backlogged orders as of july  within the first quarter of fiscal we remain heavily reliant on orders that book and ship in the same quarter turns orders 
our reliance on turns orders  the uncertain strength of our end markets and the uncertain growth rate of the world economy make it difficult to predict near term demand 
net revenue increased million or in fiscal versus primarily as the result of an increase of million or in sales of our ic products to million  and a million increase in sales of fcp products to million  for a improvement 
these sales increases are primarily the result of changes in unit sales volumes of existing products as well as the introduction and sale of new products 
in addition  fiscal benefited from having weeks  which added approximately million to net revenues 
ic products showed good sales growth  and an important factor in this was the successful introduction of new products during the year 
net revenue decreased million or in fiscal versus primarily as the result of a decrease in the sales of ic products to million  a decrease of million  and a decrease of million or in sales of our fcp product family to million 
these sales decreases are primarily the result of decreases in unit sales volumes of existing products  partially offset by the introduction and sale of new products 
for the years ended july  and june   net revenue was reduced by sales reserves for price protection and rebates in the amount of million and million  respectively 
the reserves were a consequence of the economic downturn and customers increasingly demanding price concessions 
in the future  market conditions could become more difficult as other companies compete more aggressively for business 
pricing for our higher margin ic analog switch  clock and connect products  many of which are proprietary  is more stable and new product introductions and cost reductions generally offset price declines 
the following table sets forth net revenues by country as a percentage of total net revenues for the fiscal years ended july   june  and june  fiscal year ended july  june  june  in thousands net sales to countries taiwan china including hong kong united states singapore others less than each total net sales over the past three years  sales to taiwan have increased from of total net sales in the year ended june   to in the year ended june   to in the year ended july  this shift reflects both sre s operations and manufacturing migration to asia 
sre derives its revenue primarily from customers in taiwan and china 
in addition  we are shipping an increasing number of products to asia  especially taiwan and china  where an increasing volume of contract manufacturing work occurs 
we expect our future sales to continue to grow  as a percentage of net revenues  in taiwan and china in future periods 
as the migration of assembly operations to asia continues  we expect our net revenues from sales in north america to decline modestly 
gross profit fiscal year ended fiscal year ended july  june  june  june  in thousands change change net revenues gross profit gross profit percentage the million increase in gross profit in fiscal as compared to fiscal is the result of a increase in sales  which led to million of increased gross profit  and improved margins at  resulting in a million increase in gross profit 
the million decrease in gross profit in fiscal versus fiscal was primarily due to sales declines in ic and fcp products  resulting in a million reduction in gross profit  and reduced margins in all lines as a result of competitive markets and underutilized capacity  reducing gross profit by approximately million 
during fiscal years  and  gross profits and gross margins benefited from the sale of inventory  previously valued at   and  respectively  that we had previously identified as excess and written off 
future gross profit and gross margin are highly dependent on the level and product mix included in net revenues 
this includes the mix of sales between lower margin fcp products and our higher margin integrated circuit products 
although we have been successful at favorably improving our integrated circuit product mix and penetrating new end markets  there can be no assurance that this will continue 
accordingly  we are not able to predict future gross profit levels or gross margins with certainty 
research and development fiscal year ended fiscal year ended july  june  june  june  in thousands change change net revenues research and development r d as a percentage of net revenues research and development r d expenses consist primarily of costs related to personnel and overhead  non recurring engineering charges and other costs associated with the design  prototyping and testing of new product concepts  manufacturing process support and customer applications support 
the  expense increase for fiscal as compared with fiscal is attributable primarily to increases of million in compensation related expenses including those for stock compensation and bonuses  partially offset by decreased expenditures of  for engineering masks  tooling  fabrication and assembly 
the  expense decrease for fiscal as compared with fiscal is attributable primarily to decreases of  in compensation related expenses including those for stock compensation  with the savings primarily in mandatory shutdown days and reduced bonus accruals  and decreases of  in use of outside design consultants  partially offset by increased expenditures of  for engineering masks and  for software maintenance 
we believe that continued investment in research and development to develop new products and improve manufacturing processes is critical to our success and  consequently  we expect to increase research and development expenses in future periods over the long term 
selling  general and administrative fiscal year ended fiscal year ended july  june  june  june  in thousands change change net revenues selling  general and administrative sg a as a percentage of net revenues selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  finance  administration  human resources and general management 
the million expense increase for fiscal as compared with fiscal is attributable primarily to increases of million in accounting and legal expenses in connection with the fiscal year end accounting review  quarterly restatements and delayed k filing  million in compensation related expenses including those for stock compensation   in sales commissions and  in expenditures for consultants 
the  expense decrease for fiscal as compared with fiscal is attributable primarily to decreases of  in product sample and mailing expenses   in outside sales rep commissions   in travel and entertainment expenses and  in temporary labor  partially offset by increases of  in compensation related expenses  primarily higher salaries and wages and stock compensation expenses 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods as we add to our support and administrative staff  particularly in sales and marketing  and as we face increasing commission expense to the extent we achieve higher sales levels 
in addition  as disclosed in form k furnished on august   we anticipate million of one time pti acquisition related expenses during the first quarter of fiscal year we intend to continue to focus on controlling selling  general and administrative expenses 
restructuring charge in fiscal  the company instituted a restructuring plan to align its costs with prevailing market conditions  incurring  of restructuring charges during the year that were primarily related to workforce reductions 
interest and other income  net fiscal year ended fiscal year ended july  june  june  june  in thousands change change net revenues interest income other income expense n m n m total interest and other income  net interest and other income  net as a percentage of net revenues n m means not meaningful 
the decrease in interest income including realized gains for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily the result of a  reduction in interest income due to a decline in securities income yields in as compared with  partially offset by a  increase in realized gains from the sale of investment securities 
other income expense for fiscal and primarily result from exchange rate losses and gains  respectively 
the decrease in interest income including realized gains for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily the result of an approximately reduction on average in the amount of short and long term investments in marketable securities in as compared with  partially offset by a million increase in realized gains from the sale of investment securities 
other income expense for fiscal and primarily result from exchange rate gains and losses  respectively 
interest expense interest expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as previously outstanding debt was retired in the fourth quarter 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a subsidiary company acquired its headquarters building with mortgage financing 
other than temporary decline in value of investment no other than temporary decline in value of investment was recorded in fiscal other than temporary decline in value of investment increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily because of a  decline in the value of an investment security 
the  charge was for an other than temporary impairment of a marketable debt security held in our short term investment portfolio 
this resulted from the issuing company filing for chapter bankruptcy protection 
the company s investment guidelines require a diversified portfolio of investment grade instruments  and it is unlikely that any future impairments would be material to the company s liquidity and financial position 
provision for income taxes fiscal year ended fiscal year ended july  june  june  june  in thousands change change pre tax income income tax provision effective tax rate our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes  the effect of foreign income tax and foreign losses  the utilization of research and development tax credits and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the effective tax rate for fiscal increased from fiscal primarily due to a reduced benefit from foreign income and withholding taxes  partially offset by reductions in valuation allowances 
the effective tax rate for fiscal decreased from fiscal primarily due to increased benefits from state income taxes  foreign income and withholding taxes and research and development tax credits 
a reconciliation of our tax rates for fiscal years  and is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report on form k 
equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates fiscal year ended fiscal year ended july  june  june  june  in thousands change change equity in net income of pti equity in net income of jcp equity in net losses of other investees total equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates includes our allocated portion of the net income of pericom technology  inc pti  a british virgin islands corporation based in shanghai  people s republic of china and hong kong 
pericom and certain pericom shareholders formed pti in to develop and market semiconductors in china and certain other asian countries 
we account for our investment in pti using the equity method of accounting 
we have invested in pti using several different transactions over a period of years 
initially  pti generated losses which were attributable to each of the various rounds of financing and we accounted for those losses using our percentage of each round of financing until our investment was exhausted 
when pti began showing gains  we recouped our losses against each of the rounds 
during fiscal and most of we accounted for our equity in pti following our ownership of pti s series a preferred stock  but late in we reverted to using our overall ownership position as the series a investment recovery was completed  thus recuperating all previously recorded losses 
our ownership position declined slightly to as of july  from at june  as a result of additional shares issued by pti 
our allocated portion of pti s results increased to income of million in fiscal as compared with  in fiscal  and  in fiscal on august   we entered into an agreement to acquire all remaining outstanding shares of pti capital stock not previously owned by pericom for up to approximately million in cash 
for additional information concerning the pti transaction  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this report  and our form k filed on august  equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates also includes the company s allocated portion of the net income of jiyuan crystal photoelectric frequency technology ltd 
jcp  an fcp manufacturing company located in science park of jiyuan city  henan province  china 
jcp is a key manufacturing partner of sre  and sre has acquired a equity interest in jcp 
for fiscal  the company s allocated portion of jcp s results was income of  as compared with  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended july   net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in income of our consolidated subsidiary sre was  we acquired the noncontrolling interest of our consolidated subsidiary sre during the year 
for the year ended june   net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in income of our consolidated subsidiaries ptl and sre was  we acquired the noncontrolling interest in ptl during fiscal for the year ended june   net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in income of ptl and sre was  liquidity and capital resources as of july   our principal sources of liquidity included continuing operations as well as cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments of approximately million  as compared with million at june  and million as of june  in fiscal  and  we made no acquisitions of other companies other than purchase of the noncontrolling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries 
on august   we entered into an agreement to acquire all remaining outstanding shares of pti capital stock not previously owned by us for up to approximately million in cash 
we anticipate million will be paid out at the close of the transaction scheduled during the first quarter of fiscal  with an earn out of up to an additional million to be disbursed approximately one year later 
the company s investment in debt securities includes government securities  commercial paper  corporate debt securities and mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
government securities include us treasury securities  us federal agency securities  foreign government and agency securities  and us state and municipal bond obligations 
many of the municipal bonds are insured  those that are not are nearly all aaa aaa rated 
the corporate debt securities are all investment grade and nearly all are single a rated or better 
the asset backed securities are aaa aaa rated and are backed by auto loans  student loans  credit card balances and residential or commercial mortgages 
most of our mortgage backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages issued by government agencies including fnma  fhlmc and fhlb 
those issued by banks are aaa rated 
at july   unrealized gains on marketable securities net of taxes were  when assessing marketable securities for other than temporary declines in value  we consider a number of factors 
our analyses of the severity and duration of price declines  portfolio manager reports  economic forecasts and the specific circumstances of issuers indicate that it is reasonable to expect marketable securities with unrealized losses at july  to recover in fair value up to our cost bases within a reasonable period of time 
we have the ability and intent to hold investments with unrealized losses until maturity  when the obligors are required to redeem them at full face value or par  and we believe the obligors have the financial resources to redeem the debt securities 
accordingly  we do not consider our investments to be other than temporarily impaired at july  as of july   we owned assets classified as cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at june  and million as of june  the maturities of our short term investments are staggered throughout the year to ensure we meet our cash requirements 
because we are primarily a fabless semiconductor manufacturer  we have lower capital equipment requirements than other semiconductor manufacturers that own fabrication foundries fabs 
during the fiscal year  we purchased million of property and equipment as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in capital expenditures for property and equipment in fiscal and compared with fiscal reflected primarily the expenditure of million for the construction of a new facility in jinan  people s republic of china  for the manufacture of fcp products 
we generated approximately million of interest and other income  net during the fiscal year ended july  compared to million and million in the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
in the longer term  we may generate less interest and other income if our total invested balance decreases and the decrease is not offset by rising interest rates or realized gains on the sale of investment securities 
in fiscal  our net cash provided by operating activities of million was the result of net income of million plus million in net favorable non cash adjustments to net income  less unfavorable changes in assets and liabilities of million 
the favorable adjustments to net income were primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation of million   in deferred taxes and stock compensation tax benefit of  partially offset by million of realized gain on investments  and million of non cash equity in net income of our unconsolidated affiliates 
the unfavorable changes in assets and liabilities primarily included a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in net inventory  a million increase in prepaids and other current assets  and a million decrease in accrued liabilities  partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in long term liabilities 
in fiscal  our net cash provided by operating activities of million was the result of net income of million plus million in net favorable non cash adjustments to net income  plus favorable changes in assets and liabilities of million 
the favorable non cash adjustments to net income were primarily comprised of depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation of million  other than temporary investment impairments of  and stock compensation tax benefit of  partially offset by million of realized gain on investments   in deferred taxes and  of non cash equity in net income of our unconsolidated affiliates

the company will continue to evaluate subsequent events through the date of the issuance of the financial statements  however  consistent with the guidance  this date will no longer be disclosed 
asu does not have any impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
in january  the fasb issued an asu which clarifies and provides additional disclosure requirements on the transfers of assets and liabilities between level quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities and level significant other observable inputs of the fair value measurement hierarchy  including the reasons for and the timing of the transfers 
additionally  the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases  sales  issuance  and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs level fair value measurements

in december  the fasb issued accounting standards codification asc no 
 transition related to noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statement asc  previously referred to as statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
asc establishes new accounting and reporting standards for a non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
asc clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the non controlling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
asc also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
the provisions of asc are effective for the fiscal year beginning june  and the presentation and disclosure requirements must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented at that date

item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure at july   the company s investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash equivalents  with fair value of million see note of notes to financial statements 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
we could realize a loss on these securities if we were forced to sell them in a period when interest rates are higher than current rates 
we do not expect such a scenario to occur 
for example  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of july   such as from to  the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would be approximately million 
on the other hand  if interest rates were to decline the effect on our portfolio would be in the opposite direction 
when the general economy weakens significantly  as it did in and  the credit profile  financial strength and growth prospects of certain issuers of interest bearing securities held in our investment portfolios may deteriorate  and our interest bearing securities may lose value either temporarily or other than temporarily 
we may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk return trade offs that do not perform well 
at july   we held a significant portion of our corporate cash in diversified portfolios of investment grade marketable securities  mortgage and asset backed securities  and other securities that had net unrealized gains of  net of tax 
although we consider unrealized gains and losses on individual securities to be temporary  there is a risk that we may incur other than temporary impairment charges if credit and equity markets are unstable and adversely impact securities issuers 
the company transacts business in various non us currencies  primarily the new taiwan dollar  hong kong dollar  the chinese renminbi and the japanese yen 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on accounts receivable and accounts payable from sales and purchases in these foreign currencies and the net monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries 
a hypothetical unfavorable change in the foreign currency exchange rate would reduce cash by approximately  as those monetary assets are converted to cash 
the amount is modest because the receivables and payables are nearly equal
