item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth under the heading risk factors elsewhere herein 
general we are a diversified biotechnology business that develops proprietary technologies  including products and services in the areas of drug development  genetic analysis  molecular diagnostics  nanotechnology and defense and homeland security markets  as well as in other potential markets where our products and services could be utilized 
the technologies we have developed include a platform technology to rapidly produce user defined  in situ synthesized  oligonucleotide arrays for use in identifying and determining the roles of genes  gene mutations and proteins 
other technologies include proprietary molecular synthesis and screening methods for the discovery of potential new drugs 
combimatrix molecular diagnostics  inc cmdx  our wholly owned subsidiary located in irvine  california  operates as a diagnostics reference laboratory that provides genetic diagnostics services to physicians  hospitals and clinics 
cmdx provides its services through the use of arrays that utilize bacterial artificial chromosomes bacs that enable genetic analysis 
this type of technology is generally known as acgh or  array comparative genomic hybridization  and enables the analysis of gross genetic anomalies 
cmdx also sells bac array slides to labs outside the us cmdx also utilizes other non proprietary technologies and products to augment its laboratory services in acgh as well as ancillary services 
leuchemix inc leuchemix  a minority owned subsidiary  is developing a series of compounds to address a number of oncology related diseases 
leuchemix s first compound has entered initial clinical trials in the united kingdom 
prior relationship with acacia research corporation we were originally incorporated in october as a california corporation and later reincorporated as a delaware corporation in september in december  we merged with and became a wholly owned subsidiary of acacia research corporation acacia 
in december  we filed a registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission sec in order to register our common 
table of contents stock under the securities act of as part of a plan to split off from acacia the split off 
on august  the split off date  the split off was effected and our common stock became publicly traded on the nasdaq global market symbol cbmx 
as of the split off date  we ceased to be a subsidiary of  or affiliated with  acacia 
liquidity at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and in february  we received million in proceeds from our settlement with national union fire ins 
co 
of pittsburgh  pa national union  net of attorneys fees and costs 
as a result  we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalent balances  anticipated cash flows from operations and other sources of funding from the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through approximately june in order for us to continue as a going concern beyond this point and ultimately to achieve profitability  we may be required to obtain capital from external sources  increase revenues and reduce operating costs 
however  there can be no assurance that our operations will become profitable or that external sources of capital will be available at times and at terms acceptable to us 
the issuance of additional equity securities may also cause dilution to our shareholders 
if external financing sources are not available or are inadequate to fund our operations  we will be required to reduce operating costs  including research projects and personnel  of which reduction could jeopardize the future strategic initiatives and business plans of our company 
see the liquidity and capital resources section below as well as note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these matters 
overview of recent business activities during  our business activities were driven by activities in several strategic areas 
first  we executed two new development contracts with the dod and with nasa totaling million to be recognized through additional program funding of up to  is possible through should nasa choose to continue development 
late in  we launched our next generation electrasense microarray reader that electrochemically measures up to  probes on an array in less than seconds 
our diagnostics subsidiary  cmdx  launched new updates and improvements to several of its existing tests including its hemescan  atscan and bac hd scan tests 
during  we continued the development of our cancer screen diagnostic test  which we expect to launch as a commercial test in late subject to us fda regulatory analysis 
we strengthened our executive leadership team by adding dr 
scott gottlieb  the former deputy commissioner of the us fda  to our board of directors 
in may  we closed a registered direct offering of our common stock and warrants for net proceeds of million 
finally  in september  we hired robert w 
baird co 
to serve as a financial and strategic advisor to aid combimatrix in developing and reviewing certain strategies aimed at unlocking shareholder value and creating synergistic relationships for our company  and in early  we added inverness advisors  llc to augment the efforts of robert w 
baird co 
historically  we have relied primarily upon investing and financing activities to fund operating activities 
our net proceeds from investing and financing activities in were consistent with prior years and at december   our cash and cash equivalent balances  including anticipated cash flows from future operations  proceeds from our settlement with national union and other existing sources of credit are expected to be sufficient to meet our operating capital requirements through approximately june we may be required to seek additional sources of capital including the issuance of debt and or equity securities 
during  our business activities were also driven by activities in several strategic areas 
first  we executed two new development contracts with the dod totaling million to be recognized through additional appropriations for combimatrix of up to million were included in the us defense appropriations bill for the us military  and contracts related to these appropriations are expected to be executed during our diagnostics subsidiary  cmdx  launched several new diagnostic services using its constitutional genetic array test  or cgat  during the year  including the herscan 
table of contents and proscan tests for assessment of newly diagnosed breast cancer and prostate cancer  respectively  as well as launching updates and improvements to several of its existing tests including its hemescan  atscan and bac hd scan tests 
in october  we announced the development of our cancer screen diagnostic test  which we expect to develop over the next eighteen to twenty four months 
in march  the united states district court for the central district of california the district court issued a judgment in favor of combimatrix in the amount of million the judgment to be paid by national union  and later increased the award to million for attorneys fees  litigation costs and accrued interest 
the judgment was related to a lawsuit that we brought against national union  our directors and officers insurance carrier  for failing to cover combimatrix for litigation and settlement costs incurred by us in defending a prior lawsuit that was settled in national union appealed the judgment  and we vigorously opposed its appeal until final settlement was reached in january discussed above 
finally  in july  we received million in gross proceeds from selling a secured convertible debenture and warrants to a single institutional investor 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we believe that  of the significant accounting policies discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation  fair value measurements  accounting for derivatives embedded in certain debt securities  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we discuss below the critical accounting assumptions  judgments and estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
revenue recognition as described below  significant management judgments must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue recognized or deferred for any period if management made different judgments 
in general  we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been performed  iii amounts are fixed or determinable and iv collectibility of amounts is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of products  including shipping and handling fees but excluding statutory taxes collected from customers  as applicable  are recognized when delivery has occurred 
we sell our products directly to customers and also through distributors  and our right to collection is not dependent upon 
table of contents installation or a subsequent sale of our products to end users 
our standard agreements do not provide for credits  returns or exchanges with our customers or distributors 
our distribution agreements include fixed pricing arrangements for our products and after customer acceptance  there is no written or implied right to return or exchange the products 
service revenues from providing diagnostic tests are recognized when the testing process is complete and test results are reported to the ordering physician or clinic 
these diagnostic services are billed to various payors  including commercial insurance companies  healthcare institutions  individuals and government payors including medicare and medicaid 
we report revenues from contracted payors based on a contractual rate  or in the case of medicare and medicaid  published fee schedules for our tests 
we report revenues from non contracted payors based on the amount expected to be collected 
the difference between the amount billed and the amount expected to be collected from non contracted payors is recorded as a contractual allowance to arrive at net recognized revenues 
the expected revenues from non contracted payors are based on the historical collection experience of each payor or payor group  as appropriate 
in each reporting period  we review our historical collection experience for non contracted payors and adjust our expected revenues for current and subsequent periods accordingly 
because a substantial portion of our revenues is from non contracted third party payors  it is likely that we will be required to make positive or negative adjustments to accounting estimates with respect to contractual allowances in the future  which may positively or adversely affect our results of operations 
for all periods presented  such adjustments have not been significant 
revenues from government contracts are recognized using the partial performance method of accounting  whereby performance to date is established based on costs incurred to the total amount of estimated costs at each reporting period 
under the partial performance method of accounting  contract revenues and costs are recognized in the period that work is performed based on the percentage of actual incurred costs to total contract costs 
the partial performance method is used to recognize revenue because management considers actual costs incurred to be the best available measure of progress towards the completion of government contracts  the total profit can be reasonably computed  and collection is reasonably assured 
actual contract costs include direct charges for labor and materials and indirect charges for labor  overhead and certain general and administrative charges 
contract change orders and claims are included when they can be reliably estimated and are considered probable 
for contracts that extend over a one year period  revisions in contract cost estimates  if they occur  have the effect of adjusting current period earnings applicable to performance in prior periods 
should current contract estimates indicate an overall future loss to be incurred  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
historically  contract revenue recognized approximates the amounts invoiced  resulting in no estimated costs and earnings in excess of billings or billings in excess of estimated costs and earnings 
revenues from multiple element arrangements involving license fees  up front payments  milestone payments  products and or services  which are received and or are billable by us in connection with other rights and services that represent continuing obligations of ours  are deferred until all of the elements have been delivered or until we have established objective and verifiable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements 
deferred revenues arise from payments received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process 
deferred revenues expected to be recognized within the next twelve months are classified within current liabilities 
deferred revenues will be recognized as revenue in future periods when the applicable revenue recognition criteria as described above are met 
accounting for stock based compensation compensation expense for all stock based awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense  on a straight line basis  over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award  which is generally three years for awards 
table of contents to our employees 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option valuation model 
stock based compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that are expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate 
we estimate pre vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant and reflect the impact of estimated pre vesting option forfeitures in compensation expense recognized 
we considered several factors in connection with our estimates of pre vesting forfeitures including types of awards  employee class and historical pre vesting forfeiture data 
estimates of pre vesting forfeiture are periodically revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as cumulative adjustments in the period the estimates are revised 
fair value measurements we measure fair value as an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
we utilize a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable market inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level observable market inputs  other than the quoted prices in active markets  that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs where there is little or no market data  which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions derivatives embedded in certain debt securities we evaluate financial instruments for freestanding or embedded derivatives 
derivative instruments that have been separated from the host contract and do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded at fair value with changes in value recognized in as other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the period of change 
accounting for income taxes we recognize income taxes on an accrual basis based on tax position taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns 
a tax position is defined as a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax filing that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
tax positions are recognized only when it is more likely than not ie  likelihood of greater than  based on technical merits  that the position would be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if all  or some portion  of such assets will more than likely not be realized 
should they occur  our policy is to classify interest and penalties related to tax positions as income tax expense 
since our inception  no such interest or penalties have been incurred  however 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill long lived assets and intangible assets are reviewed for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying 
table of contents amount of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques  including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment at the reporting unit level  or earlier if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
a reporting unit can be an operating segment or a business if discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by management 
under the impairment test  if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  goodwill impairment is recognized to the extent that the reporting unit s carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill 
we only have one reporting unit 
the fair value of the combimatrix corporation reporting unit for and was determined using quoted market prices for combimatrix corporation common stock 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in impaired charges 
results of operations revenues and cost of revenues in thousands for the years ended december  change government contracts cost of government contracts products cost of products services cost of services collaboration agreements government contracts and cost of government contracts 
under the terms of our contracts with the dod  we are reimbursed on a periodic basis for actual costs incurred to perform our obligations  plus a fixed fee 
under the terms of our contract with nasa  we are reimbursed on a periodic basis  based on scheduled  contractual fixed amounts 
revenues are recognized using the partial performance method of accounting  using the cost to cost approach to measure completeness at the end of the each reporting period 
cost of government contracts reflect research and development expenses incurred in connection with our commitments under our current contracts with the dod and nasa 
changes in the number of contracts underway coupled with changes in the underlying contract activity contributes to the overall increase or decrease in government contracts revenue from year to year 
the changes in contract activity also contribute to the change in government contract costs for the years presented 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed description of the amounts  completion rates and estimated costs to complete of our government contracts that are ongoing as well as prior contracts that were completed during the years presented 
as existing contracts near completion  future contract revenues could be volatile in the short term and decrease in the longer term if new government contracts are not awarded or executed 
products and cost of products 
product revenues and costs of products relate to domestic and international sales of our array products  which include dna synthesizer instruments  customarray k  xk  xk and k dna expression arrays  electrasense microarray readers and related hardware  as well as the sale of cgh arrays sold by our wholly owned subsidiary  cmdx 
product revenues decreased for the year ended december  compared to due primarily to lower dna synthesizer instrument and microarray reader sales 
as we expand our business focus from exclusively 
table of contents selling array based research and development products to providing array based diagnostic services  we have reduced internal sales staff  marketing and production efforts regarding sales of customarray products and instead have executed product distribution and manufacturing agreements with various third party distributors for the sales of our suite of customarray products into the research and development markets 
also  declining global economic conditions have negatively impacted the sales of our instruments 
as a result  customarray product revenues will likely be volatile and could decrease in future periods  depending largely on the sales efforts of our distributors 
product sales from cmdx were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of products includes materials  labor and allocations for manufacturing overhead  as well as non cash stock compensation expense charges  which were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the overall decrease in product cost of sales was commensurate with the decrease in overall product revenues 
services and cost of services 
services revenues are comprised primarily of diagnostic lab services provided by cmdx as well as the amortization of one year equipment maintenance and service contracts executed with certain customers of our dna synthesizers 
diagnostic services revenues from cmdx were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these revenues have increased due to an increased number of diagnostic test offerings as well as increased customer demand for our suite of diagnostic services provided by cmdx  which is due primarily to increased sales and marketing efforts at cmdx during and cost of services includes materials  labor and allocations for manufacturing overhead  as well as non cash stock compensation expense charges  which were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of services was commensurate with the increase in overall services revenues 
operating expenses in thousands for the years ended december  change research and development expenses marketing  general and administrative expenses patent amortization and royalties equity in loss of investee research and development expenses 
the increase in internal research and development expenses was due primarily to the ongoing development efforts underway relating to our comprehensive cancer array test 
in addition  research and development expenses include  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  of non cash stock compensation expense 
future research and development expenses will continue to be incurred in connection with our ongoing internal research and development efforts in the areas of genomics  diagnostics  drug discovery and development 
we expect our research and development expenses to continue to fluctuate and such expenses could increase in future periods as additional internal research and development agreements are undertaken and or as new research and development collaborations are executed with strategic partners 
marketing  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increases in sales and marketing expenses at cmdx  as well as increased investor and public relations expenses 
in addition  marketing  general and administrative expenses include non cash stock compensation charges  which were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these increases were due primarily to increases in the overall number of stock option awards granted to our employees during the past twelve months 

table of contents equity in loss of investee 
for all periods presented  this expense represents our recognition under the equity method of accounting of our minority interests in the operations of leuchemix  in which we own a one third minority interest 
during  our equity investment in leuchemix reached and as a result  we ceased recognizing additional expense from their underlying operations 
this has caused a decrease in this expense for the year ended december  versus other non operating items in thousands for the years ended december  change interest income interest expense derivatives charges gains interest income 
interest income decreased due to lower average cash and investment balances coupled with lower market interest rates during compared to interest expense 
since july  interest expense is recognized from the issuance of a secured convertible debenture the debenture  which accrues interest at an annual rate of of the outstanding principal amount of the debenture 
interest expense also includes amortization of the original million of debt discount recognized from issuance of the debenture and warrants in july using the effective interest method 
interest expense increased during compared to due to a full year s worth of interest and amortization charges incurred during versus only a partial year in derivative charges gains 
these amounts represent the net charges or gains recognized during the periods presented from mark to model adjustments to the embedded derivatives associated with the debenture that were outstanding as of december  and the conversion feature  cash redemption option  potential acceleration of maturity of the debenture and potential adjustments to the fixed conversion price all represent embedded derivatives of the debenture that are recorded separately at fair value as other liabilities  with the corresponding fair value adjustments reflected as non operating charges or gains  depending upon the results of mark to model valuation adjustments 
the fair value of the embedded derivatives was determined using the convertible bond model  discounted cash flows and binomial lattice models 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact in the current or prior periods 
liquidity and capital resources at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  compared to million at december  working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  working capital decreased as of december  primarily due to the classification of the remaining million debenture due july  as a short term liability as well as the overall decreases in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investment balances compared to december  cash balances decreased during due primarily to the operating and financing transactions discussed below that were executed in versus 
table of contents the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december  and was comprised of the following in thousands for the years ended december  change net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
the overall decrease in net cash used in operations was due primarily to a decrease in cash receipts from customers  which totaled million in compared to million in the primary reason for the decrease in cash receipts from customers was due to decreased cash receipts from fewer active dod contracts in compared to this decrease was partially offset by a decrease in cash outflows to vendors  which was million in compared to million in this decrease was caused primarily by lower litigation costs in compared to as well as timing of vendor payments 
investing activities 
the decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was due primarily to our ongoing short term cash management activities and changes in short term investments in connection with certain financing activities discussed below 
fixed asset purchases were  and  in and  respectively 
financing activities 
the decrease in cash flows from financing activities was driven by certain financing transactions that were executed during the years ended december  and as follows during  our financing activities were driven primarily by the completion of a registered direct offering the offering of our common stock and warrants for gross proceeds of million  which we closed on may  under the terms of the offering  we sold million units for per unit to certain investors 
each unit consisted of one share of our common stock and one warrant  each warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants were not exercisable until six months after the offering and have a term of five years 
net proceeds from the offering  less placement agent fees and expenses  were approximately million 
also impacting our net cash flows from financing activities was the repayment of credit line borrowings during the first quarter of totaling  finally  proceeds from the exercise of common stock options were  during during  our financing activities were driven primarily by the issuance to ya global investments  lp ya of i the debenture with an aggregate principal amount of million  which was originally convertible into shares of our common stock at a fixed conversion price of per share and subsequently adjusted to per share due to execution of the offering in  and ii warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
the debenture was due on the earlier of july  or within four months after receipt of payment of the settlement proceeds from national union in accordance with the judgment 
the debenture bore interest at an annual rate of  with interest payments due quarterly in either cash or our common stock 
we repaid the debenture in full in also impacting our net cash flows from financing activities was a draw on our credit line totaling  during the second quarter of finally  proceeds from the exercise of common stock options were  during 
table of contents future liquidity 
we have a history of incurring net losses and net operating cash flow deficits 
we are also deploying new and unproven technologies and continue to develop commercial products 
we have several ongoing long term development projects that involve experimental technology and may require several years and substantial expenditures to complete 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances  proceeds from our settlement with national union received february  anticipated cash flows from operations and other external sources of available credit will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through approximately june in order for us to continue as a going concern beyond june  we may be required to obtain capital from external sources 
however  there can be no assurances that additional sources of financing  including the issuance of debt and or equity securities will be available at times and at terms acceptable to us 
the issuance of equity securities will also cause dilution to our shareholders 
if external financing sources of financing are not available or are inadequate to fund our operations  we will be required to reduce operating costs including research projects and personnel  which could jeopardize the future strategic initiatives and business plans of the company 
for example  reductions in research and development activities and or personnel at our mukilteo  washington facility could result in the inability to invest the resources necessary to continue to develop next generation products and improve existing product lines in order to remain competitive in the marketplace  resulting in reduced revenues and cash flows from the sales of our customarray products and services 
also  reduction in operating costs at cmdx  should they occur  could jeopardize its ability to launch  market and sell additional diagnostics products and services necessary to grow and sustain its operations to eventually achieve profitability 
capital requirements 
we may also encounter unforeseen difficulties that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated 
any efforts to seek additional funding could be made through equity  debt or other external financing  and there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
our long term capital requirements will be substantial and the adequacy of available funds will depend upon many factors  including the costs of commercialization activities  including sales and marketing  manufacturing and capital equipment  our continued progress in research and development programs  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending any patents claims  should they arise  our ability to license technology  competing technological developments  the creation and formation of strategic partnerships  the costs associated with leasing and improving our irvine  california facility  and other factors that may not be within our control 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into off balance sheet financing arrangements  other than operating leases for our premises 
we have no significant commitments for capital expenditures in or beyond 
we have 
table of contents executed three capital leases totaling  for certain laboratory equipment 
the following table lists our material known future cash commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands and thereafter operating leases capital leases minimum royalty payments secured convertible debenture total contractual obligations the principal amount of the debenture due to ya as of december  was million and is due the earlier of july  or four months after receiving the settlement payment from national union 
on february   we repaid million of the debenture from settlement proceeds received from national union  pursuant to a settlement agreement executed between us  acacia and national union on january  on march   the remaining million of principal  plus accrued interest  was repaid to ya 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term debt securities issued by the us treasury 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments in a variety of investment grade securities and with a variety of issuers  including government securities and money market funds
