item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of securities act of  as amended  section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and the private securities litigation reform act of  including statements regarding our expected financial position  business and financing plans 
these statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the headings forward looking statements and risk factors 
overview we are a global provider of information technology  or it  and business services and solutions with specialized expertise in software product engineering  system integration  application development and consulting  and software distribution 
we deliver our portfolio of services and solutions using a global delivery model combining offshore  near shore and local teams 
the primary industries  or verticals  we serve include high tech companies and independent software vendors  or isvs  utilities and public sector  financial services  defense and homeland security  and life sciences and healthcare 
we have operations in countries across north america  europe  israel and asia pacific 
we combine our deep expertise in the verticals we serve and strong technical capabilities to provide a complete range of high quality services on a global scale 
by integrating our local and international personnel in focused business and project teams  we leverage our corporate knowledge and experience  intellectual property and global infrastructure to develop innovative solutions for clients across the geographic areas and verticals we serve 
through our global delivery model  which includes lower cost offshore and near shore delivery capabilities  we can achieve meaningful cost reductions or other benefits for our clients 
our revenues decreased to million for from million for we had a net loss from continuing operations of million in compared to net income from continuing operations of million in the revenue decrease resulted from lower demand for it services during the worldwide economic recession  and the net loss was largely attributable to a charge we recorded in the fourth quarter for restructuring  severance and related project costs of million  related impairment of goodwill and long lived assets of million  and a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets of million 
the dollar strengthened by an average of against the nis and by an average of against the euro and other relevant european currencies in compared to approximately of our revenues and of our expenses are denominated in non dollar currencies 
we estimate that our revenues were million lower  and our operating loss was million higher  in as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates versus their average rates for our client base is diverse  and we are not dependent on any single client 
in  no client accounted for more than of our revenues and our largest twenty clients together accounted for approximately of our revenues 
for  the percentage of our revenues derived in aggregate from agencies of the government of israel was 
existing clients from prior years generated more than of our revenues in 
table of contents our backlog as of december  was million compared to million as of december  this represents a year over year backlog decline of million plus the sale of a business unit with associated backlog of million  offset by an increase of million in the dollar value of our non us backlog due to the slightly weaker dollar on december  compared to december  we achieve backlog through new signings of it services projects and outsourcing contracts  including for new and repeat customers 
we recognize backlog as revenue when we perform the services related to backlog 
as of december   we had approximately  employees  including approximately  it professionals 
of the  employees  approximately  were in india   were in israel   were in europe  were in north america and were in the asia pacific region 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
the actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and which could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that the accounting policies described below meet these characteristics 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate our revenues from contracts for software product engineering  system integration  application development and consulting services  and sales of third party software licenses 
we provide services on either a fixed price or time and materials basis 
for time and materials contracts  we recognize revenues as services are performed based on the hours actually incurred at the negotiated billing rates 
we also charge our clients for certain costs and expenses  such as the installation of hardware and cost of subcontractors 
our fixed price contracts relate primarily to long term development projects 
the revenues for such projects that require significant customization  integration and installation are recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the percentage of costs incurred to date in relation to the total estimated costs expected upon completion 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding the resources and time required to fulfill the contracts obligations including work effort and subcontractors 
we rely on our experience from other projects in making these estimates  and  in addition  use our internal project management and financial systems to track and manage the projects 
employees and project managers regularly submit updates to these systems  which are then used by executive management to monitor the projects and revise the estimates  if necessary 
historically  our estimates have been indicative of our actual results  however  there have been cases where we adjusted assumptions  primarily regarding work effort 
as of december   our provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was million 
we generally recognize revenues on a gross basis  representing the entire amount  because we bear the risks and rewards of ownership  including the risk of loss for collection  delivery and returns  and have latitude in establishing product pricing above specific minimums 
management determines whether we bear the risks and rewards of ownership based on relevant sale contract terms 
whenever the majority of contract terms indicate that we bear the risks and rewards  revenues are recognized on a gross basis 
for most software license sales and hardware sales  we record revenues on a net basis  based on management s determination that a majority of the contract terms indicate that we do not bear the risks and rewards related to such contracts 

table of contents for arrangements that involve multiple revenue activities  ie  the delivery or performance of multiple products and services  management allocates the associated consideration to the separate activities based on their relative fair values 
in order to determine the fair values of the different activities covered by each agreement  management applies standard pricing used for products and services in similar arrangements and hourly rates based on similar activities we have performed for other clients 
our revenue recognition approach for software licensing requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and is based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered  and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the credit worthiness of each client based upon market capitalization and other information  including the aging of the receivables 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in each financial period  we estimate the likelihood of collecting every receivable and record a cumulative allowance 
business combinations in accordance with purchase accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from license and service sales  maintenance agreements  customer contracts and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and discount rate 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill we perform tests for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that long lived assets may not be recoverable 
this analysis differs from our goodwill analysis in that an impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the assets we are testing for impairment 
if the forecasted undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then we must write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment of long lived assets in the total amount of million related to restructuring the operations of our system integration and application development segment in the asia pacific region 
these forecasted undiscounted cash flows include estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and operating margins  future economic and market conditions 
our estimates of market segment growth and our market segment share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
our business consists of both established and emerging technologies and our forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information 
if future forecasts are revised  they may indicate or require future impairment charges 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 

table of contents we perform our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of december of each year  or more often if there are indicators of impairment present 
we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill at the level of the reporting units 
in the first step  or step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the net assets  goodwill is considered not impaired  and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value  then we must perform the second step  or step  of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
to determine the fair value used in the step  we use discounted cash flows 
if and when we are required to perform a step analysis  determining the fair value of our net assets and our off balance sheet intangibles would require us to make judgments that involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we performed our annual impairment test as of december  and recorded impairment of our goodwill and long lived assets in the total amount of million in connection with a our software distribution segment  which resells third party enterprise software licenses  and which we restructured due to ongoing performance below expectations as large license deals in europe continue to be deferred  and b the operations of our system integration and application development segment in the asia pacific region  where we have undertaken a restructuring effort with respect to selected smaller operations that were unprofitable or that we determined were not strategic to our planned future operations and growth 
we determined the fair value of each reporting unit using the income approach  which utilizes a discounted cash flow model  as we believe that this approach best approximates the reporting unit s fair value at this time 
judgments and assumptions related to revenue  operating income  future short term and long term growth rates  weighted average cost of capital  interest  capital expenditures  cash flows  and market conditions are inherent in developing the discounted cash flow model 
the material assumptions used for the income approach for were five years of projected net cash flows  a discount rate of to and a long term growth rate of 
we considered historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates to use in our analyses 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill 
we corroborated the fair values using the market approach 
we evaluated the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of our reporting units by reconciling to our market capitalization 
this reconciliation allowed us to consider market expectations in corroborating the reasonableness of the fair value of our reporting units 
in addition  we compared our market capitalization  including an estimated control premium that an investor would be willing to pay for a controlling interest in us  to our fair value based on a third party valuation study 
the determination of a control premium requires the use of judgment and is based primarily on comparable industry and deal size transactions  related synergies and other benefits 
our reconciliation of the gap between our market capitalization and the aggregate fair value of the company depends on various factors  some of which are qualitative and involve management judgment  including stable relatively high backlog coverage and experience in meeting operating cash flow targets 
we will continue to monitor our market capitalization and expectations of future cash flows and will perform impairment testing if deemed necessary 
we performed a sensitivity analysis for the two key assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test and determined that an increase in the estimated weighted average cost of capital of would result in the estimated fair value of one of the reporting units within our system integration segment falling below its carrying value 
at december   the fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 
we believe that this reporting unit is at risk for goodwill impairment based on the combination of its higher goodwill balance and its operating results  which were affected by the worldwide economic recession 
based on the sensitivity analysis  none of our other reporting units is at risk for goodwill impairment 
when we reorganize our operating segments to correspond to changes in our management structure  we reallocate our goodwill balance to the new reportable segments based on their relative fair values 
this process  which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis  is subjective and involves management judgment and related assumptions 

table of contents tax accounting we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
we use a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations 
our effective tax rate was and for and  respectively  while in we had tax expense on a pre tax loss 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
legal contingencies we are the defendants or plaintiffs in various lawsuits  including employment claims and other legal proceedings in the normal course of our business 
in determining whether provisions should be recorded for pending litigation claims  we assess the allegations made and the likelihood that we will successfully defend ourselves or prosecute our claims 
when we believe that it is probable that we will not prevail in a particular matter  we then estimate the amount of the provision required based in part on our legal counsels advice 
recent developments as we disclosed on february  in our earnings conference call for the quarter and fiscal year ended december   we have decided to sell the majority of our operations in the asia pacific region 
on february   we signed a non binding memorandum of understanding with a potential buyer 
the asia pacific operations being offered for sale represent approximately million to million of revenue on an annual basis  no net operating income or loss  and approximately employees

recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards codification asc  derivatives and hedging  as amended by fas asc 
asc changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
asc requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we adopted asc and  as a result  changed our disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in may  the fasb issued asc  subsequent events asc 
this standard is intended to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
specifically  this standard sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
asc is effective for fiscal years and interim periods ended after june  we adopted this standard effective june  the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and notes 
in june  the fasb issued asc topic  generally accepted accounting principles fasb codification 
fasb codification is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  and became the single official source of authoritative  non governmental us gaap  other than guidance 
table of contents issued by the securities and exchange commission 
all other literature will become non authoritative 
the standard does not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and notes 
in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 measuring liabilities at fair value  which provides additional guidance on how companies should measure liabilities at fair value 
the asu clarifies that the quoted price for an identical liability should be used 
however  if such information is not available  a entity may use the quoted price of an identical liability when traded as an asset  quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities traded as assets  or another valuation technique such as the market or income approach 
the asu also indicates that the fair value of a liability is not adjusted to reflect the impact of contractual restrictions that prevent its transfer and indicates circumstances in which quoted prices for an identical liability or quoted price for an identical liability traded as an asset may be considered level fair value measurements 
for us  this asu is effective october  we adopted this standard effective october  and our adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements amendments to fasb asc topic  revenue recognition asu  and asu no 
 certain arrangements that include software elements amendments to fasb asc topic  software asu 
asu requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy 
the amendments eliminate the residual method of revenue allocation and require revenue to be allocated using the relative selling price method 
asu removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are covered by the scope of the software revenue guidance 
as a result of the amendments included in asu no 
 many tangible products and services that rely on software will be accounted for under the multiple element arrangements revenue recognition guidance rather than under the software revenue recognition guidance 
asu no 
also provides guidance on how to allocate transaction consideration when an arrangement contains both deliverables within the scope of software revenue guidance software deliverables and deliverables not within the scope of that guidance non software deliverables 
asu and asu are to be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have operations in different countries and commercial relationships in many other parts of the world 
our foreign operations contract with clients using applicable local currencies  euros or dollars 
as a result  we are subject to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates in countries in which we conduct business 
our earnings are predominantly affected by fluctuations in the value of the dollar as compared to the new israeli shekel  the indian rupee  the euro and the czech crown  and to some extent by fluctuations in intra european currency rates 
as an example  a decrease of in the value of the euro relative to the dollar would have resulted in an increase in the dollar reporting value of our operating income of million  while an increase of in the value of the euro relative to the dollar would have resulted in a decrease in the dollar reporting value of our operating income of million 
in order to reduce the effect of such movements on our earnings  we utilize certain foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our exposure against the indian rupee 
in the future  we may enter into additional forward foreign currency exchange or other derivatives contracts to further hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
we utilize interest rate swap derivatives to convert certain floating rate debt to fixed rate debt 
our interest rate swap derivatives involve an agreement to pay a fixed rate interest and receive a floating rate interest  at specified intervals  calculated on an agreed notional amount that matches the amount of the original loan and paid on the same installments and maturity dates 

table of contents other than as described above  we do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments or purchase hedging or other than trading instruments that are likely to expose us to market risk  whether interest rate  commodity price or equity price risk  nor have we purchased options or entered into swaps or forward or futures contracts  nor do we use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
in the future  we may be subject to interest rate risk on our investments and loans  which would affect their carrying value
