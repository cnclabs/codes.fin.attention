item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
cautionary statement the discussion below contains forward looking statements regarding our financial condition and our results of operations that are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states  as well as projections for the future 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we operate in a highly competitive environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
we are subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory actions and marketing approvals  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  competition associated with products  potential competition associated with our product candidates and retention of key employees 
in order for any of our product candidates to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us  or our collaborative partners  to conduct clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of the product candidate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  obtain market acceptance and adequate reimbursement from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate significant revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
in addition  we can provide no assurance that we will have sufficient funding to meet our future capital requirements 
statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical facts are  or may constitute  forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks that could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results 
the most significant known risks are discussed in the section entitled risk factors 
although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
our revenues are difficult to predict and depend on numerous factors 
the effectiveness of our ability and the ability of third parties on which we rely to help us manufacture  distribute and market azasite  physician and patient acceptance of azasite  competitor response to azasite  as well as discounts  pricing and coverage on governmental and commercial formularies  are all factors  among others  that will impact the level of revenue recorded for azasite in subsequent periods 
through the year ended december   we actively promoted both restasis and elestat through our commercial organization 
as of january   we are no longer responsible for the co promotion of restasis  but we continue to receive royalties on allergan s net sales of restasis 
our co promotion and royalty revenues are based upon allergan s revenue recognition policy and other accounting policies  over which we have limited or no control  and on the underlying terms of our co promotion agreements 
our co promotion and royalty revenues are impacted by the number of governmental and commercial formularies upon which restasis and elestat are listed  the discounts and pricing under such formularies  as well as the estimated and actual amount of rebates  all of which are managed by allergan 
other factors that are difficult to predict and that impact our co promotion and royalty revenues are the extent and effectiveness of allergan s sales and marketing efforts  our sales and marketing efforts  coverage and reimbursement under medicare part d and medicaid programs  and the sales and marketing activities of competitors 
additionally  our ability to receive revenues on future sales of azasite  restasis and elestat are dependent upon the duration of market exclusivity and strength of patent protection 
revenues related to development activities are dependent upon the progress toward and the achievement of developmental milestones by us or our collaborative partners 

table of contents our operating expenses are also difficult to predict and depend on several factors 
cost of sales related to azasite contain variable and fixed cost components 
research and development expenses  including expenses for development milestones  drug manufacturing  and clinical research activities  depend on the ongoing requirements of our development programs  completion of business development transactions  availability of capital and direction from regulatory agencies  which are difficult to predict 
management may in some cases be able to control the timing of research and development expenses  in part by accelerating or decelerating clinical development activities  but many of these expenditures will occur irrespective of whether our product candidates are approved when anticipated or at all 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant selling and marketing expenses to commercialize our products 
again  management may in some cases be able to control the timing and magnitude of these expenses 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as an indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that our operating results will be below the expectations of market analysts and investors 
in such event  the prevailing market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on researching  developing and commercializing prescription pharmaceutical products for ophthalmic and pulmonary diseases 
our goal is to build and commercialize a sustainable portfolio of innovative new products based on our technical and scientific expertise 
the most advanced compounds in our clinical pipeline are denufosol tetrasodium for cystic fibrosis and prolacria for dry eye  both of which are in phase development  and azasite for blepharitis  which is in phase development 
we receive revenue related to the promotion of azasite for bacterial conjunctivitis  co promotion of elestat for allergic conjunctivitis and royalties on restasis for dry eye 
in february  we signed an exclusive licensing agreement with insite vision for the us and canadian commercialization rights of azasite for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis 
in april  azasite was approved by the fda for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis in adults and children one year of age and older 
in august  we launched azasite in the united states and are promoting it to eye care specialists 
in  we launched elestat for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and began co promoting restasis for the treatment of dry eye disease 
in december  we amended our agreement with allergan and terminated our co promotion responsibilities related to restasis 
under agreements with allergan  we receive revenue based upon allergan s net sales of these products 
see part i item business of this report for a full discussion of our agreements with insite vision  allergan and other significant collaborative agreements  as well our other product candidates in clinical development 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
revenue from sales of azasite  restasis and elestat did not exceed our total operating expenses in we expect to incur operating losses for the next several years 
we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities  including private sales of preferred stock and public offerings of common stock  debt  and with revenue from corporate partnerships  including co promotion and royalty revenue 
we operate as a single business segment and do not have any foreign operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and 
table of contents judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  judgments and the policies underlying these estimates on a periodic basis  as situations change and regularly discuss financial events  policies  and issues with members of our audit committee and our independent registered public accounting firm 
in addition  recognition of revenue from product co promotion and earned royalties is affected by certain estimates and judgments made by allergan on which we rely when recording this revenue 
we routinely evaluate our estimates and policies regarding revenue recognition  product returns  rebates and incentives  inventory and manufacturing  taxes  stock based compensation  research and development  marketing and other expenses and any associated liabilities 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we record all of our revenue from sales of azasite  product co promotion activities and earned royalties  and collaborative research agreements when realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenues we recognize revenue for sales of azasite when title and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which generally occurs on the date of shipment  with the exception of transactions whereby product stocking incentives were offered approximately one month prior to the product s august  launch 
in the united states  we sell azasite to wholesalers and distributors  who  in turn  sell to pharmacies and federal  state and commercial health care organizations 
sales deductions consist of statutory rebates to state medicaid  medicare and other government agencies  contractual rebates with commercial managed care organizations  wholesaler chargebacks  sales discounts including trade discounts and distribution service fees  allowances for coupon and voucher programs and product returns 
these deductions are recorded as reductions to revenue from azasite in the same period as the related sales with estimates of future utilization derived from historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
we utilize data from external sources to help us estimate our gross to net sales adjustments as they relate to the recognition of revenue for azasite sold 
external sourced data includes  but is not limited to  information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell through to customers  targeted surveys as well as data from ims health  a third party supplier of market research data to the pharmaceutical industry 
we also utilize this data to help estimate and identify prescription trends and patient demand  as well as product levels in the supply chain 
we account for these sales deductions in accordance with the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  authoritative guidance on revenue recognition when consideration is given by a vendor to a customer as well as when the right of return exists 
we have categorized and described more fully  the following significant sales deductions  all of which involve estimates and judgments which we consider to be critical accounting estimates  and require us to use information from external sources 

table of contents rebates and chargebacks statutory rebates to state medicaid agencies and medicare and contractual rebates to commercial managed care organizations are based on statutory or negotiated discounts to the selling price 
as it can take up to nine months or more for information to be received on actual usage of azasite in managed care and medicaid and other governmental programs as well as on the total discounts to be reimbursed  we maintain reserves for amounts payable under these programs relating to azasite sales 
chargebacks claimed by wholesalers are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs 
the amount of the reserve for rebates and chargebacks is based on multiple qualitative and quantitative factors  including the historical and projected utilization levels  historical payment experience  changes in statutory laws and interpretations as well as contractual terms  product pricing both normal selling prices and statutory or negotiated prices  changes in prescription demand patterns and utilization of our product through private or public benefit plans  and the levels of azasite inventory in both the wholesale and retail distribution channel 
other factors that we may consider  if determined relevant would include price changes from competitors and introductions of generics and or competitive new products 
we acquire prescription utilization data from ims health  a third party supplier of market research data to the pharmaceutical industry 
we apply these multiple factors  the quantitative historical data along with other qualitative aspects  such as management s judgment regarding future utilization trends  to the respective period s sales of azasite to determine the rebate accrual and related expense 
we update our estimates and assumptions each period and record any necessary adjustments to our reserves 
settlements of rebates and chargebacks typically occur within nine months from point of sale 
to the extent actual rebates and chargebacks differ from our estimates  additional reserves may be required or reserves may need to be reversed  either of which would impact current period product revenue 
as of december  and  reserves for rebates and chargebacks were million and  respectively 
discounts and other sales incentives discounts and other sales incentives consist of the following prompt pay discounts prompt payment discounts are offered to all wholesalers in return for payment within days following the invoice date 
we record sales of azasite net of the discount amount based on historical experience 
we adjust the reserve at the end of each reporting period to approximate the percentage discount applicable to the outstanding gross accounts receivable balances 
inventory management agreement ima fees per contractual agreements with our largest wholesalers which collectively represented over of azasite sales  we provide an ima fee based on a percentage of their purchases of azasite 
the ima fee rates are set forth in the individual contracts 
we track sales to these wholesalers each period and accrue a liability relating to the unpaid portion of these fees by applying the contractual rates to such sales 
product coupons and vouchers product coupons and vouchers offer patients the ability to receive free or discounted product through their pharmacy or prescribing physician  to whom we provide an inventory of coupons or vouchers as applicable 
we use a third party administrator who invoices us on a periodic basis for the cost of coupons and vouchers redeemed in the period 
we base our estimates on the historical coupon and voucher redemption rate of similar programs 
as of december  and  reserves for discounts and other sales incentives were  and  respectively 

table of contents product returns at the time of sale of azasite  we record product returns allowances based on our estimate of the portion of sales that will be returned by our customers in the future 
the return allowances are established in accordance with our return policy 
our return goods policy generally allows for returns of azasite within an month period  from six months prior to the expiration date and up to months following the expiration date  but may differ from customer to customer  depending on certain factors 
future estimated returns of azasite are based primarily on the return data for comparative products and our own historical experience with azasite 
historical returns data on azasite is analyzed on a specific production lot basis 
in determining our return allowance we also consider other relevant factors  including levels of inventory in the distribution channel and any significant changes to these levels estimated expiration date or remaining shelf life of inventory in the distribution channel current and projected demand of azasite that could be impacted by introductions of generic products and or introductions of competitive new products  and competitive product recalls and or discontinuances our estimates of the level of azasite inventory in the distribution channel is based on inventory data provided by wholesalers  and third party prescription data 
as of december  and  reserves for returns of azasite were million and  respectively 
the following table reflects the gross to net sales accruals and the balance in the related allowance accounts for the years ended december   and balance at beginning of year related to current period sales related to prior period sales credits payments balance at end of year year ended december  reserve for rebates and chargebacks reserve for discounts and other sales incentives allowance for returns total sales deductions accruals year ended december  reserve for rebates and chargebacks reserve for discounts and other sales incentives allowance for returns total sales deductions accruals year ended december  reserve for rebates and chargebacks reserve for discounts and other sales incentives allowance for returns total sales deductions accruals immediately preceding the launch of azasite  we offered wholesalers stocking incentives that allowed for extended payment terms  product discounts  and guaranteed sale provisions collectively  special terms 
these special terms were only offered during a specified time period of approximately one month prior to the august  launch of azasite 
any sales of azasite made under these special term provisions were 
table of contents accounted for using a consignment model since substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership did not transfer upon shipment 
under the consignment model  we did not recognize revenue upon shipment of azasite purchased with the special terms  but recorded deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price  less all appropriate discounts and rebates  and accounted for azasite inventory held by the wholesalers as consignment inventory 
we recognized the revenue from these sales with special terms at the earlier of when the inventory of azasite held by the wholesalers was sold through to the wholesalers customers or when such inventory of azasite was no longer subject to these special terms 
at december   we had net deferred revenue of  related to sales of azasite considered consignment  which was fully recognized in the three months ended march  all sales subsequent to this specified launch time period include return rights and pricing that are customary in the industry  as discussed above 
product co promotion and royalty revenues we recognize co promotion revenue based on net sales of elestat and royalty revenue based on net sales of restasis  as defined in the co promotion agreements  and as reported to us by allergan 
through the year ended december   we actively promoted both restasis and elestat through our commercial organization 
as of january   we are no longer responsible for the co promotion of restasis  but we continue to receive royalties on allergan s net sales of restasis 
our co promotion and royalty revenues are based upon allergan s revenue recognition policy and other accounting policies over which we have limited or no control and on the underlying terms of our co promotion agreements 
allergan recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
the co promotion agreements provide for gross sales to be reduced by estimates of sales returns  credits and allowances  normal trade and cash discounts  managed care sales rebates and other allocated costs as defined in the agreements  all of which are determined by allergan and are outside our control 
we record a percentage of allergan s reported net sales to us for elestat and restasis  as co promotion revenue and royalty revenue  respectively 
we receive monthly net sales information from allergan and perform analytical reviews and trend analyses using prescription information that we receive from ims health 
in addition  we exercise our audit rights under the contractual agreements with allergan to annually perform an examination of allergan s sales records of both restasis and elestat 
we make no adjustments to the amounts reported to us by allergan other than reductions in net sales to reflect the incentive programs managed by us 
we offer and manage certain incentive programs associated with elestat  which are utilized by us in addition to those programs managed by allergan 
we reduce co promotion revenue from net sales of elestat by estimating the portion of sales that are subject to these incentive programs based on information reported to us by our third party administrator of the incentive programs 
the rebates associated with the programs we manage represent an insignificant amount  as compared to the rebate and discount programs administered by allergan and as compared to our aggregate co promotion and royalty revenue 
under the co promotion agreement for elestat  we are obligated to meet predetermined minimum calendar year net sales target levels 
if the annual minimum is not achieved  we record revenues using a reduced percentage of net sales based upon our level of achievement of the predetermined calendar year net sales target levels 
amounts receivable from allergan in excess of recorded co promotion revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
calendar year was the last year in which there is a minimum annual net sales target level for elestat under the co promotion agreement 
collaborative research and development revenues we recognize revenue under our collaborative research and development agreements when we have performed services under such agreements or when we or our collaborative partner have met a contractual milestone triggering a payment to us 
we recognize revenue from our research and development service agreements ratably over the estimated service period as related research and development costs are incurred and the services are substantially performed 
upfront non refundable fees and milestone payments received at the initiation of collaborative agreements for which we have an ongoing research and development commitment are deferred and recognized ratably over the period in which the services are substantially performed 
this period  if not defined in the collaborative agreement  is based on estimates by management and the progress towards 
table of contents agreed upon development events as set forth in our collaborative agreements 
these estimates are subject to revision as our development efforts progress and we gain knowledge regarding required additional development 
revisions in the commitment period are made in the period that the facts related to the change first become known 
if the estimated service period is subsequently modified  the period over which the upfront fee or revenue related to ongoing research and development services is modified on a prospective basis 
we are also entitled to receive milestone payments under our collaborative research and development agreements based upon the achievement of agreed upon development events that are substantively at risk by our collaborative partners or us 
this collaborative research and development revenue is recognized upon the achievement and acknowledgement of our collaborative partner of a development event  which is generally at the date payment is received from the collaborative partner or is reasonably assured 
accordingly  our revenue recognized under our collaborative research and development agreements may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
no collaborative research and development revenue was recognized for the years ended december  and in the year ended december   we recognized million of collaborative research and development revenue from santen upon the completion of its phase clinical testing relating to its formulation of diquafosol tetrasodium 
inventories our inventories are related to azasite and are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out ie  fifo method 
cost includes materials  labor  overhead  shipping and handling costs 
our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and provide valuation reserves for any estimated obsolete  short dated or unmarketable inventories 
our determination that a valuation reserve might be required  in addition to the quantification of such reserve  requires us to utilize significant judgment 
we base our analysis  in part  on the level of inventories on hand in relation to our estimated forecast of product demand  production requirements for forecasted product demand  expected market conditions and the expiration dates or remaining shelf life of inventories 
as of december  and  we had net reserves of  and  respectively  for potential overstocking 
taxes we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance regarding the accounting for taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against all potential tax assets due to uncertainties in our ability to utilize deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
liabilities we generally enter into contractual agreements with third party vendors to provide research and development  manufacturing  and other services in the ordinary course of business 
many of these contracts are subject to milestone based invoicing and services are completed over an extended period of time 
we record liabilities under these contractual commitments when we determine an obligation has been incurred  regardless of the timing of the invoice 
we monitor all significant research and development  manufacturing  sales and marketing and other service activities and the progression of work related to these activities 
we estimate the underlying obligation for each activity based upon our estimate of the amount of work performed and compare the estimated obligation against the amount that has been invoiced 
because of the nature of certain contracts and related delay in the contract s invoicing  the obligation to these vendors may be based upon management s estimate of the underlying obligation 
we record the larger of our estimated obligation or invoiced amounts for completed service 
in all cases  actual results may differ from our estimate 

table of contents stock based compensation expense we recognize stock based compensation expense in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance regarding the accounting for share based payments  which requires us to measure compensation cost for share based payment awards at fair value and recognize compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to value our awards and recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of our awards 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
our expected volatility is determined based on our own historical volatility 
the estimation of share based payment awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
significant management judgment is also required in determining estimates of future stock price volatility  forfeitures and expected life to be used in the valuation of the options 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
impact of inflation we do not believe that our operating results have been materially impacted by inflation during the past three years 
however  we cannot assure that our operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
we will continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation on the costs of goods and services that we use through improved operating efficiencies and cost containment and periodic price increases for our product 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenues were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december   and approximately million in the increase in revenue of approximately million  or  as compared to the same period in  was primarily due to an increase in product revenue from net sales of azasite  as well as increased royalty revenue from net sales of restasis 
the increase in revenue of approximately million  or  was primarily due to product revenue from a full year of net sales of azasite  as well as increased co promotion revenue from net sales of restasis  partially offset by a decrease in co promotion revenue from net sales of elestat 
in addition  total revenues for the period included the recognition of a development milestone of million from santen for its development of diquafosol tetrasodium in accordance with our development  license and supply agreement  as previously discussed in this report 
product sales  net product sales of azasite  net of rebates and discounts  for the year ended december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in azasite was launched by us in august the increase in revenue for azasite of approximately million  or  as compared to  was primarily due to increased patient and physician usage of azasite  evidenced by an increase of prescriptions year over year  as well as a price increase for the product between the periods 
approximately million to million of revenue from sales of azasite for the year ended december  was associated with hospital usage of azasite as a substitute therapy during a temporary supply shortage of erythromycin ophthalmic ointment  as discussed below 
in september  erythromycin ophthalmic ointment was placed on the fda drug shortages website 
erythromycin ophthalmic ointment is a macrolide antibiotic routinely used in neonates for prophylaxis of 
table of contents ophthalmia neonatorum  a form of bacterial conjunctivitis that may be contracted by newborns during delivery 
due to this shortage  the centers for disease control and prevention cdc asked healthcare professionals to reserve erythromycin supplies for neonatal use and also recommended the use of azasite as an acceptable substitute for neonatal prophylaxis use when erythromycin was not available 
we expect the erythromycin supply shortage to be resolved in the first quarter of and future use of azasite for neonatal use  as described above  to be limited 
the increase in azasite revenues in as compared to was partially offset by an increase in gross to net sales deductions 
total sales deductions as a percentage of gross revenues increased approximately 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in rebates associated with an increase in the number of formularies that now list azasite and the price concessions required to secure this coverage under medicare and commercial managed care organizations 
additionally  we incurred an increase in ima fee rates to wholesalers 
the impact of these increases in coverage and ima fee rates was approximately million in additional provisions in for the year ended december   based on prescription data from ims health  there were approximately  prescriptions written for azasite  excluding hospital usage  representing approximately of all prescriptions in the single agent ocular anti infective market  defined as both branded and generic single entity ocular antibiotics 
in comparison  approximately  prescriptions were written for azasite in  representing approximately of all prescriptions in the single agent ocular anti infective market 
in addition  our market share in our primary call audience of eye care specialists  mainly ophthalmologists and optometrists  was approximately as of december   as compared to approximately as of december  since launch  actual units of azasite dispensed have been slightly higher than the number of prescriptions as reported by ims health due to the issuance of multiple unit prescriptions by some physicians 
for the year ended december   the single agent ocular anti infective market  in terms of prescriptions  was relatively unchanged from the prior year 
in july  we started receiving and processing orders for azasite as part of the initial stocking of the supply chain 
these initial orders were offered with special terms as stocking incentives for wholesalers 
sales with these special terms were accounted for using the consignment model  which requires that we defer revenue until such time that the product is resold further into the supply chain or the product is no longer subject to the special terms 
as a result  as of december   approximately  of net azasite revenues were deferred and subsequently recognized in the first quarter of sales made subsequent to this specified launch time period include return rights that are customary in the industry 
for these orders  we are recording revenue at the date of shipment  when title and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership has transferred to the customer 
product co promotion and royalty total co promotion and royalty revenue for the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in our royalty revenue from net sales of restasis for the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in on december   we amended our agreement with allergan such that we ceased co promoting restasis as of december  notwithstanding the fact that we are no longer co promoting restasis  allergan remains obligated to pay us royalties in relation to net sales of restasis at the rates in effect prior to the december amendment 
for the years ended december   and  allergan recorded revenue from net sales of restasis of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in both and royalty revenue for restasis  as compared to and  respectively  was primarily due to increased patient usage of restasis and an increase in prescribers of restasis  as evidenced by an increase in prescriptions year over year 
in addition  there were annual price increases in the first quarters of and 
table of contents co promotion revenue from net sales of elestat for the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in the increase in co promotion revenue from net sales of elestat of  or  as compared to  was primarily due to an annual price increase that became effective in the first quarter of  partially offset by a slight decrease in the total us allergic conjunctivitis market in the decrease in co promotion revenue from net sales of elestat of million  as compared to  was primarily due to a decline in the us allergic conjunctivitis market in terms of prescriptions as well as a decline in elestat s market share based on national prescription data as provided by ims health 
this decrease was partially offset by an annual price increase for elestat that became effective during the first quarter of elestat is a seasonal product with product demand mirroring seasonal trends for topical allergic conjunctivitis products 
typically  demand is highest during the spring months followed by moderate demand in the summer and fall months 
the lowest demand is during the winter months 
based upon national prescription data from ims health  for the years ended december   and  elestat prescriptions  as a percentage of the total us allergic conjunctivitis market  represented approximately  and  respectively  of the total us allergic conjunctivitis market 
subject to the entry of a generic epinastine product as discussed below  based on current trends in prescriptions for elestat  we expect our market share to remain relatively constant with or slightly decrease 
based upon monthly data from ims health  the total us allergic conjunctivitis market  in terms of prescriptions as compared to the previous year  decreased approximately  and  respectively  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the third quarter of  ista pharmaceuticals  inc received fda approval for bepreve tm bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution as a twice daily prescription eye drop treatment for ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis  and began commercializing this product in october under our agreement with allergan related to our co promotion of elestat  prior to  we were obligated to meet predetermined minimum calendar year net sales target levels  which increased annually 
we were entitled to an escalating percentage of net sales of elestat based upon predetermined calendar year net sales target levels 
during a fiscal year  we recognized product co promotion revenue associated with targeted net sales levels for elestat achieved during that time period and deferred revenue in excess of the sales level achieved 
under the co promotion agreement with allergan  calendar year was the last year that our co promotion revenues of elestat are subject to annual minimum target levels 
subject to applicable law  competitors are permitted to submit to the fda an anda for a generic version of elestat  due to the expiration of the marketing exclusivity period for elestat provided under the hatch waxman act on october  we have been notified that boehringer ingelheim and allergan received notices from four companies apotex  inc  cypress pharmaceutical  inc  paddock laboratories  inc  and sandoz inc  advising that each company filed an anda for a generic version of elestat 
the date of submission of the first filing to the fda office of generic drugs was october   according to the fda s website www 
fda 
gov 
furthermore  we have been notified by allergan that boehringer ingelheim has decided not to file infringement lawsuits against the anda filers 
boehringer ingelheim is the owner of a method of treatment patent related to elestat  and we do not have a license to this patent 
the elestat co promotion agreement provides that unless earlier terminated  the term of such agreement will be in effect until the earlier of i the approval and launch of the first generic epinastine product after expiration of the fda exclusivity period covering elestat in the united states  or ii the approval and launch of the first over the counter epinastine product after expiration of the listing of elestat in the fda s orange book 
following the termination of such co promotion agreement  we will no longer have rights to co promote elestat 
we will be entitled to receive post termination payments from allergan  based on any remaining net sales of 
table of contents elestat for a period of months 
during the three successive month periods immediately following the termination of the agreement  allergan will be obligated to pay to us  and  respectively  on any net sales of elestat in the united states 
we expect any revenue from net sales of elestat received during this month post termination period to be minimal 
we plan to continue co promoting and receiving co promotion revenues on elestat sales during the fda s review period of these andas 
we do not know when the fda will complete its review but we expect that a generic form of epinastine could be launched in the second half of loss of our co promotion revenue from elestat will significantly impact our results of operations and cash flows 
collaborative research and development in may  santen completed its phase clinical testing of diquafosol tetrasodium in japan  which it refers to as de  for which we received a milestone payment of million 
we did not receive any collaborative research and development revenue during or santen is responsible for all development  regulatory submissions  filings and approvals  and the commercialization of potential products in japan and nine other asian countries 
we could receive additional development milestone payments from santen of up to million  as well as royalties on net sales of diquafosol tetrasodium  if the product candidate is approved for commercialization in santen s licensed territories 
santen filed an application for manufacturing and marketing approval of de with the japanese ministry of health  labor  and welfare the japanese equivalent of the fda on may   which is pending review 
our future revenue will depend on various factors including the effectiveness of our commercialization of azasite and continued commercial success and duration of commercial exclusivity of restasis and elestat 
in addition to the foregoing  pricing  rebates  discounts and returns for all products  the effect of competing products  coverage and reimbursement under commercial or government plans  and seasonality of sales of elestat will impact future revenues 
if allergan significantly under estimates or over estimates rebate amounts  there could be a material effect on our revenue 
in addition to the continuing sales of azasite  restasis and elestat  our future revenue will also depend on our ability to enter into additional collaboration agreements  and to achieve milestones under existing or future collaboration agreements  as well as whether we obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates 
cost of sales cost of sales related to the sales of azasite were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in the increase in cost of sales of million  or  as compared to  was primarily due to increased sales volume of azasite  which has resulted in increased royalties  as well as an increase in the royalty rate  paid to insite vision 
through june   we paid a royalty to insite vision on net sales of azasite in accordance with our licensing agreement 
in july  our royalty rate to insite vision on net sales of azasite increased from to and will remain at for the remaining term of the licensing agreement 
cost of sales expense consists of variable and fixed cost components 
variable cost components include royalties to insite vision on net sales of azasite  the cost of azasite inventory sold  distribution  shipping and logistic service charges from our third party logistics provider  and changes to our inventory reserve for overstocking or short dated material 
fixed cost components are primarily the amortization of the million approval milestone that we paid insite vision as part of our licensing agreement 
this approval milestone is being amortized ratably on a straight line basis through the term of the underlying patent coverage for azasite  which expires in march certain costs included in cost of sales are subject to annual increases for which we have limited control 
we expect that cost of sales will increase in relation to  but not proportionately to  the increases in revenue from sales of azasite 

table of contents costs and expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in the increase in research and development expenses of approximately million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily due to increased costs associated with our cystic fibrosis program  including the recognition of an approximate million milestone payable to yamasa corporation upon entering into an agreement to license certain technology related to manufacturing in support of this program 
effective september   we entered into a technology license agreement with yamasa corporation to facilitate the transfer of the current denufosol manufacturing technology  including intellectual property  to an additional manufacturer and thus enable a two supplier strategy for denufosol 
the remaining increase in research and development expenses was due to the initiation of a phase program for azasite for the treatment of blepharitis 
these increases in research and development expenses for the year ended december  were partially offset by reduced spending on our glaucoma program as a result of the completion of phase trial activities  the discontinuation of our program for the development of epinastine nasal spray for allergic rhinitis in  and cost savings from our restructuring activities in the first quarter of the decrease in research and development expenses of approximately million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily due to a one time million upfront azasite licensing fee paid in which did not occur in excluding this one time fee  our research and development expenses associated with our other product candidates increased approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to  and was primarily due to increased activities associated with our cystic fibrosis and glaucoma product candidates 
additionally  we incurred a general increase in annual salaries  personnel related expenses and stock based compensation expense 
see part i item business of this report for a detailed development status of these programs 
research and development expenses include all direct and indirect costs  including salaries for our research and development personnel  consulting fees  clinical trial costs  including the development and manufacture of drug product for clinical trials  sponsored research costs  clinical trial insurance  upfront license fees  milestone and royalty payments relating to research and development  and other fees and costs related to the development of product candidates 
research and development expenses vary according to the number of programs in clinical development and the stage of development of our clinical programs 
later stage clinical programs tend to cost more than earlier stage programs due to the length of the clinical trials and the number of patients enrolled in later stage clinical trials 
our future research and development expenses will depend on the results and magnitude or scope of our clinical activities and requirements imposed by regulatory agencies 
year over year spending on active development programs can vary due to the differing levels and stages of development activity  the timing of certain expenses and other factors 
accordingly  our research and development expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in addition  if we in license or out license rights to product candidates  our research and development expenses may fluctuate significantly from prior periods

in thousands year ended december  cumulative from inception to december  denufosol tetrasodium for cystic fibrosis prolacria diquafosol tetrasodium for dry eye disease azasite for blepharitis ins and ins for glaucoma and related research and development epinastine nasal spray for allergic rhinitis azasite other research  preclinical and development costs total includes the recognition of an approximate million milestone in september in april  we discontinued the development of epinastine nasal spray 
expense in includes a million upfront licensing fee upon the signing of the license agreement with insite vision 
prior to february  other research  preclinical and development costs represent all unallocated research and development costs or those costs allocated to preclinical programs as well as costs of discontinued and or inactive programs 
these unallocated costs included personnel costs of our research  preclinical programs  internal and external general research costs and other internal and external costs of other research  preclinical and development programs 
in february  we restructured our operations eliminating our preclinical and molecule discovery activities 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in the decrease in selling and marketing expenses of approximately million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to  was due to an overall reduction in promotional and marketing activities  including phase clinical trial activities  partially offset by a general increase in personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation expense 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses of approximately million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to  resulted from an overall increase in various expenses primarily associated with the full year commercialization of azasite  including a full year of expenses related to our expanded sales force and managed markets group 
additionally  we had increased marketing and promotional activities and phase program costs in we also incurred a general increase in annual salaries  personnel related expenses and stock based compensation expense 
our commercial organization currently focuses its promotional efforts on approximately  eye care specialists 
our selling and marketing expenses include all direct costs associated with the commercial

our sales force expenses include salaries  training and educational program costs  product sample costs  fleet management and travel 
our marketing and promotion expenses include product management  promotion  advertising  public relations  phase clinical trial costs  physician training and continuing medical education and administrative expenses 
we adjust the timing  magnitude and targeting of our advertising  promotional  phase clinical trials and other commercial activities for our products based on seasonal trends and other factors  and accordingly  these costs can fluctuate from period to period 
future selling and marketing expenses will depend on the level of our future commercialization activities 
we expect selling and marketing expenses will increase in periods that immediately precede and follow product launches 
in addition  if we in license or out license rights to products  our selling and marketing expenses may fluctuate significantly from prior periods 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative costs were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in the increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily due to an increase in consulting and legal expenses  as well as an increase in personnel related expenses and stock based compensation

on december   the fourth circuit of the unites states court of appeals issued an opinion affirming the judgment of the district court 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel  facility and related costs for general corporate functions  including business development  finance  accounting  legal  human resources  quality compliance  facilities and information systems 
future general and administrative expenses will depend on the level and extent of support required to conduct our future research and development  commercialization  business development  and corporate activities 
restructuring in march  we announced that we had restructured our operations during the first quarter of  eliminating preclinical and drug discovery activities and refocusing our resources on the development of existing 
table of contents later stage clinical programs and commercially available products 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million for the year ended december   which are reported in a separate line item in our statement of operations 
significant components of the restructuring charge were one time termination benefits for employees impacted by the restructuring  estimated costs to write down idle lab equipment to net realizable value  losses associated with leased lab space that is now vacant  and costs to satisfy contract commitments related to activities and programs no longer associated with our supported programs and on going operations 
as a result of this restructuring  cost savings for were approximately million to million 
other income expense for the year ended december   we incurred other expense  net of approximately million  as compared to approximately million in other expense  net in and approximately million in other income  net in the increase in other expense  net of approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to  was due to decreased interest income partially offset by a decrease in interest expense 
interest income was negatively impacted due to lower average cash and investment balances combined with a lower rate of return during  as compared to the decrease in interest expense is the result of a lower average outstanding principal balance of our term loan facility during  as compared to the decrease in other income of approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to  was due to a combination of decreased interest income and increased interest expense 
interest income was negatively impacted due to a lower rate of return on our cash and investments as well as lower average cash and investment balances in compared to the increase in interest expense was associated with additional borrowings of an aggregate of million during under our term loan facility 
other income expense fluctuates from year to year depending on the level of interest income earned on variable cash and investment balances  realized gains and losses on investments due to changes in fair market value and interest expense on debt and capital lease obligations 
future other income expense will depend on our future cash and investment balances  the return and change in fair market value on these investments  as well as levels of debt and the associated interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  including private sales of preferred stock and public offerings of common stock and  to a lesser extent  through our term loan facility 
we also currently receive co promotion revenue from net sales of elestat  royalty revenue from net sales of restasis  and product revenue from net sales of azasite 
we do not expect our revenue to exceed our operating expenses in at december   we had net working capital of approximately million  an increase of approximately million from approximately million at december  the increase in working capital was principally due to the sale of common stock described below  offset by the funding of normal operating expenses associated with commercialization activities and the development of our product candidates  as well as principal and interest payments on our term loan facility 
our principal sources of liquidity at december  were approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  approximately million in investments  which are considered available for sale  and approximately million in trade receivables 
in august  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  which included an additional  shares underwriter over allotment option  for gross proceeds of million 
net proceeds were million  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 

table of contents in july  we completed a sale of preferred stock to warburg pursuant to which we sold  shares of our exchangeable preferred stock at a price per share of  for net proceeds of million 
the exchangeable preferred stock was exchanged for  shares of common stock on october  in december  we entered into a loan and security agreement in order to obtain debt financing of up to million to fund in licensing opportunities and related development 
in june  we amended the loan and security agreement to enable us to draw upon a new supplemental term loan facility in the amount of million 
we have borrowed the full million under the term loan facility of which million remained outstanding as of december  we make scheduled principal and interest payments on a monthly basis and all loan advances made under the agreement have a final maturity date in march see note debt to our financial statements for further discussion regarding the term loan facility 
in march  we announced that we had restructured our operations during the first quarter of  eliminating preclinical and drug discovery activities and refocusing our resources on the development of existing later stage clinical programs and commercially available products 
as a result of this restructuring  we expect to eliminate future cash expenditures of approximately million on an annual basis subsequent to our working capital requirements may fluctuate in future periods depending on many factors  including the number  magnitude  scope and timing of our development programs  the commercial potential and success of our products  the potential loss of commercial exclusivity of any of our products  the loss of revenue from our products due to competition or loss of market share  the level of ongoing costs related to the commercialization of azasite and elestat  the costs related to the potential fda approval of our other product candidates  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  regulatory investigations  and changes in regulatory requirements  the costs of obtaining patent protection for our product candidates  the timing and terms of business development activities  the rate of technological advances relevant to our operations  the timing  method and cost of the commercialization of our product candidates  the efficiency of manufacturing processes developed on our behalf by third parties  the level of required administrative support for our daily operations  the availability of capital to support product candidate development programs we pursue  and the commercial potential of our product candidates 
financial guidance based upon current trends and assumptions  we expect to record aggregate revenue in the range of million 
co promotion revenue from net sales of elestat will be dependent upon the timing of a launch of a generic form of epinastine which we expect may occur in the second half of furthermore  hospital usage of azasite is expected to decline significantly due to the resolution of the supply shortage of erythromycin ophthalmic ointment in the first quarter of total operating expenses are expected to be in the range of million based on our planned activities 
cost of sales  which includes the amortization of the azasite approval milestone and royalty obligations to insite vision  is expected to be in the range of million 
total estimated selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses are estimated to be in the range of million and million  respectively 
research and development expenses are estimated to be in the range of million 
included within this operating expense guidance are projected stock based compensation costs of approximately million 
due to expense associated with our ceo transition  primarily stock based compensation expense  we expect the first quarter general and administrative expenses to be the largest as compared to the remaining quarters of in addition  a significant portion of our promotional activities usually occur during the first quarter of each year 
as a result  we expect that the first quarter commercial expenses will be the largest of our ability to remain within our operating expense target range is subject to multiple factors  including unanticipated cost overruns  the need to expand or reduce the magnitude or scope of existing development programs  the need to change the number or timing of clinical trials  unanticipated regulatory requirements  unanticipated costs to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates  the commercial success of our current products and other factors described under the risk factors located elsewhere in this report 

table of contents operating cash utilization in is expected to be in the range of million  which incorporates million of principal repayment on our outstanding debt 
our need for additional working capital will largely be determined by the commercial success of our products and the successful and timely completion of our development programs 
in order for us to continue operations substantially beyond we will need to successfully increase revenues  obtain additional product candidate approvals  out license rights to certain of our product candidates  raise additional capital through equity or debt financings or from other sources  reduce spending on one or more research and development programs and or further restructure our operations 
additionally  after deducting the million of common stock sold in august  we retain the ability to offer for sale million of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares and securities warrants from an effective shelf registration statement which we filed with the sec on march  the loan and security agreement that we entered into in december  as amended in june  contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain certain levels of liquidity based on our cash  investment and account receivables balances  as well as negative covenants that may limit us from assuming additional indebtedness and entering into other transactions as defined in the agreement 
the agreement also includes a subjective acceleration clause which provides our lenders with the ability to accelerate repayment  even if we are in compliance with all conditions of the agreement  upon a material adverse change to our business  properties  assets  financial condition or results of operations 
at december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our loan and security agreement and project that we will be throughout contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business  we enter into various agreements that create contractual obligations and commitments that may require future cash payments 
contractual obligations at december  included operating leases of million  long term borrowings of million  interest payments of million  and purchase obligations and other commitments  as further described below 
as part of our drug development strategy  we outsource significant amounts of our preclinical and clinical programs and the manufacture of drug substance used in those programs 
in addition  we have manufacturing  promotion and clinical responsibilities and activities associated with the commercialization of azasite 
based on these requirements and activities  we have entered into contractual commitments or purchase obligations with various clinical research organizations  promotion and advertising agencies  manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug product for clinical and commercial use as well as with others 
these financial commitments  which totaled approximately million as of december   are reflected as purchase obligations in the table below and include both cancelable and non cancelable arrangements 
since many of these commitment amounts are dependent upon variable components of the agreements  actual payments and the timing of those payments may differ from management s estimates 
the terms of our existing license  collaboration and sponsored research agreements may require that we make cash payments contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events 
in the aggregate  these agreements may require payments of up to million assuming the achievement of all development milestones and up to an additional million assuming the achievement of all sales milestones 
amounts payable by us under these agreements are uncertain and are contingent on a number of factors  including the progress of our research  preclinical and development programs  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals  the commercial success of our approved products and future annual product sales levels 
if certain of our product candidates are approved by the fda and are subsequently commercialized  we will be obligated to pay royalties on net sales of the commercialized products 
see part i item business collaborative agreements of this report for a full discussion of our royalty obligations under our in licensing agreement with wisconsin alumni research foundation for our glaucoma product candidates 
in addition  we are obligated to pay royalties to insite vision as part of our in licensing agreement for azasite 
under the terms of the agreement  our obligation to pay royalties to insite vision is subject to pre determined minimum annual 
table of contents royalty payments 
the determination of whether or not we will owe any such payments is based upon the amount of royalties accrued over a month royalty period 
there are five successive month minimum royalty periods  the first of which commenced on october  the minimum royalties escalate each year 
remaining minimum royalties as of december  total million 
the table below reflects contractual and potential obligations as of december  some of the figures we include in this table are based on management s estimate and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors as previously described 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table in thousands payment due by period as of december  contractual and potential obligations total less than year years years more than years debt obligations interest on debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum annual license payments development milestone obligations minimum royalties and sales milestone obligations total includes estimated payments of  for the cancelable portion of operating leases  primarily our fleet vehicles under a master lease agreement 
see note  commitments and contingencies for a full discussion 
purchase obligations reflect all contractual obligations  including amounts that are cancelable  under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable 
these amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our balance sheet as of december  includes million of other long term liabilities as recorded on our balance sheet as of december  development and sales milestone obligations represent potential amounts payable by us contingent on a number of factors  including the progress of our research  preclinical and development programs  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals  and the commercial success of our approved products 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance requires some new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement 
the new disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years

table of contents residual method of revenue allocation and requires revenue to be allocated using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently assessing the impact of adopting this new guidance 
in august  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding measuring liabilities at fair value 
the authoritative guidance sets forth the types of valuation techniques to be used to value a liability when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available 
it also clarifies transfer restrictions on the fair value of a liability and the ability to use the fair value of a liability that is traded as an asset as an input to the valuation of the underlying liability

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio and borrowings under our term loan facility 
we invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve capital  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investment portfolio may consist of a variety of securities  including united states government and government agency obligations  money market and mutual fund investments  municipal and corporate notes and bonds and asset or mortgage backed securities 
as of december   cash equivalents consisted of million in a money market account and million in money market funds and million in a us government agency security with a maturity less than days 
our investment portfolio as of december  consisted of corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper  us government and agency securities  and negotiated certificates of deposit and had an average maturity of less than months  using the stated maturity 
all of our cash  cash equivalents and investments are maintained at two banking institutions 

table of contents our investment exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our portfolio  changes in the market value due to changes in interest rates and other market factors as well as the increase or decrease in any realized gains and losses 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities and instruments with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity and we have implemented guidelines limiting the duration of investments 
at december   our portfolio of available for sale investments consisted of approximately million of investments maturing within one year and approximately million of investments maturing after one year but within months 
in general  securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities 
a hypothetical basis point drop in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not significantly affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments to maturity and therefore do not expect that our operating results  financial position or cash flows will be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates 
however  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates or other factors  such as changes in credit risk related to the securities issuers 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we ensure the safety and preservation of invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we reduce default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited to future capital leases and other short term debt obligations we may incur in our normal operations 
the interest rates on our long term debt borrowings under the term loan facility are fixed and as a result  interest due on borrowings are not impacted by changes in market based interest rates 
investment risk in addition to our normal investment portfolio  we have an investment in parion sciences  inc of  as of december  this investment is in the form of unregistered common stock and is subject to higher investment risk than our normal investment portfolio due to the lack of an active resale market for the parion sciences  inc securities 
foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our transactions occur in us dollars and we do not have subsidiaries or investments in foreign countries 
therefore  we are not subject to significant foreign currency exchange risk 
we do  however  have foreign currency exposure with regard to the purchase of active pharmaceutical ingredients as they relate to azasite  which is manufactured by a foreign based company  future milestone payments due under the technology license agreement with yamasa corporation  as well as development activities currently ongoing in europe 
we have established policies and procedures for assessing market and foreign exchange risk 
as of december   we did not have any material foreign currency hedges
