regulation and supervision the company expects competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry 
technological advances  for example  have lowered barriers to entry  allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and made it possible for non depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks 
changes in federal law permit affiliation among banks  securities firms and insurance companies  which promotes a competitive environment in the financial services industry 
competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit the company s growth in the future 
regulation and supervision of the company general 
the company is a public company registered with the securities and exchange commission the sec  whose common stock trades on the nasdaq stock market llc and is a bank holding company subject to regulation by the federal reserve board under the bank holding company act  as amended bhca

as a bank holding company  the company is required to file annual and quarterly reports with the federal reserve board and to furnish such additional information as the federal reserve board may require pursuant to the bhca 
the company is also subject to regular examination by the federal reserve board 
dividends 
the federal reserve board has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices 
the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies  which expresses the federal reserve board s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
the federal reserve board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends 
under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the federal reserve board  the federal reserve board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company s bank subsidiary is classified as undercapitalized 
see regulation and supervision of the bank prompt corrective regulatory action 
stock repurchases 
as a bank holding company  the company is required to give the federal reserve board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption  when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding months  is equal to or more of the company s consolidated net worth 
the federal reserve board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would violate any law  regulation  federal reserve board order  directive  or any condition imposed by  or written agreement with  the federal reserve board 
this requirement does not apply to bank holding companies that are well capitalized  well managed and are not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues 
acquisitions 
the company is required to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve board to acquire all  or substantially all  of the assets of any bank or bank holding company or merge with another bank holding company 
prior federal reserve board approval will also be required for the company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if  after giving effect to such acquisition  the company would  directly or indirectly  own or control more than of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company 
in evaluating such transactions  the federal reserve board considers such matters as the financial and managerial resources of and future prospects of the companies involved  competitive factors and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served 
bank holding companies may acquire additional banks in any state  subject to certain restrictions such as deposit concentration limits 
with certain exceptions  the bhca prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company  or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks  or providing services for its subsidiaries 
the principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non bank activities  which  by statute or by federal reserve board regulation or order  have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking 
the activities of the company are subject to these legal and regulatory limitations under the bhca and the related federal reserve board regulations 
the gramm leach bliley act of authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions  including being well capitalized and well managed  to opt to become a financial holding company  and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted 
such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking 
the company has not  up to this time  opted to become a financial holding company 
the federal reserve board has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity  or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary  when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company 
under the change in bank control act of the cbca  a day prior written notice must be submitted to the federal reserve board if any person including a company  or any group acting in concert  seeks to acquire of any class of the company s outstanding voting securities  unless the federal reserve board determines that such acquisition will not result in a change of control of the bank 
under the cbca  the federal reserve board has days within which to act on such notice taking into consideration certain factors  including the financial and managerial resources of the proposed acquiror  the convenience and needs of the community served by the bank and the antitrust effects of an acquisition 
under the bhca  any company would be required to obtain prior approval from the federal reserve board before it may obtain control of the company within the meaning of the bhca 
control for bhca purposes generally is defined to mean the ownership or power to vote or more of any class of the company s voting securities or the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of the company s directors 
an existing bank holding company would be required to obtain the federal reserve board s prior approval under the bhca before acquiring more than of the company s voting stock 
under indiana banking law  prior approval of the indiana department of financial institutions is also required before any person may acquire control of an indiana bank or bank holding company 
the department will issue a notice approving the transaction if it determines that the persons proposing to acquire the indiana bank or bank holding company are qualified in character  experience and financial responsibility  and the transaction does not jeopardize the interests of the public 
capital requirements 
the federal reserve board has adopted guidelines regarding the capital adequacy of bank holding companies  which require bank holding companies to maintain on a consolidated basis  specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk weighted assets 
these requirements  which generally apply to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of million or more  are substantially similar to those applicable to the bank 
see regulation and supervision of the bank capital requirements 
regulation and supervision of the bank general 
the bank  as an indiana chartered commercial bank  is subject to extensive regulation by the indiana department of financial institutions and the fdic 
the lending activities and other investments of the bank must comply with various regulatory requirements 
the indiana department of financial institutions and fdic periodically examine the bank for compliance with various regulatory requirements 
the bank must file reports with the indiana department of financial institutions and the fdic describing its activities and financial condition 
the bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated by the federal reserve board 
this supervision and regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors 
certain of these regulatory requirements are referred to below or appear elsewhere in this form k 
the regulatory discussion  however  does not purport to be an exhaustive treatment of applicable laws and regulations and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations 
the bank s conversion from an indiana savings bank to an indiana commercial bank has not materially changed the regulatory requirements applicable to the bank 
federal banking law capital requirements 
under fdic regulations  state chartered banks that are not members of the federal reserve system are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital requirement consisting of a ratio of tier capital to total assets of if the fdic determines that the institution is not anticipating or experiencing significant growth and has well diversified risk  including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings  and in general  a strong banking organization  rated composite under the uniform financial institutions rating system the camels rating system established by the federal financial institutions examination council 
for all but the most highly rated institutions meeting the conditions set forth above  the minimum leverage capital ratio is 
tier capital is the sum of common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock including any related surplus and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  minus all intangible assets other than certain mortgage and certain other servicing assets  purchased credit card relationships  credit enhancing interest only strips and certain deferred tax assets  identified losses  investments in certain financial subsidiaries and non financial equity investments 
in addition to the leverage capital ratio the ratio of tier i capital to total assets  state chartered nonmember banks must maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of at least  of which at least half must be tier capital 
qualifying total capital consists of tier capital plus tier capital also referred to as supplementary capital items 
tier capital items include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to of risk weighted assets  cumulative preferred stock and preferred stock with a maturity of over years  certain other capital instruments and up to of pre tax net unrealized holding gains on equity securities 
the includable amount of tier capital cannot exceed the institution s tier capital 
qualifying total capital is further reduced by the amount of the bank s investments in banking and finance subsidiaries that are not consolidated for regulatory capital purposes  reciprocal cross holdings of capital securities issued by other banks  most intangible assets and certain other deductions 
under the fdic risk weighted system  all of a bank s balance sheet assets and the credit equivalent amounts of certain off balance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad risk weight categories from to  based on the regulators perception of the risks inherent in the type of assets or item 
the aggregate dollar amount of each category is multiplied by the risk weight assigned to that category 
the sum of these weighted values equals the bank s risk weighted assets 
at december   the bank s ratio of tier capital to total assets was  its ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets was and its ratio of total risk based capital to risk weighted assets was 
investment activities 
since the enactment of federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  all state chartered fdic insured banks have generally been limited in their activities as principal and their equity investments to the type and in the amount authorized for national banks  notwithstanding state law 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act and the fdic regulations permit exceptions to these limitations 
the fdic is authorized to permit such institutions to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks other than non subsidiary equity investments if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the deposit insurance fund 
the fdic has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments 
the gramm leach bliley act of specifies that a non member bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a financial subsidiary if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes 
interstate banking and branching 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of permitted bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state subject to specified concentration limits and other conditions 
the interstate banking act also authorizes the interstate merger of banks 
in addition  among other things  the interstate banking act permits banks to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that such action is specifically authorized by the law of the host state 
dividend limitations 
the bank may not pay dividends on its capital stock if its regulatory capital would thereby be reduced below the amount then required for the liquidation account established for the benefit of certain depositors of the bank at the time of its conversion to stock form 
in addition  the bank may not pay dividends that exceed retained net income for the applicable calendar year to date  plus retained net income for the preceding two years without prior approval from the indiana department of financial institutions 
at december   the shareholders equity of the bank was million 
earnings of the bank appropriated to bad debt reserves and deducted for federal income tax purposes are not available for payment of cash dividends or other distributions to stockholders without payment of taxes at the then current tax rate by the bank on the amount of earnings removed from the reserves for such distributions 
see federal and state taxation 
under fdic regulations  the bank is prohibited from making any capital distributions if  after making the distribution  the bank would fail to meet any applicable capital requirements 
for additional information about dividend limitations see note in the consolidated financial statements 
insurance of deposit accounts 
the bank s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund of the fdic 
the deposit insurance fund is the successor to the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund  which were merged in under the fdic s risk based assessment system  insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations  regulatory capital levels and certain other factors  with less risky institutions paying lower assessments 
an institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned 
for calendar  assessments ranged from five to forty three basis points of each institution s deposit assessment base 
due to losses incurred by the deposit insurance fund in from failed institutions  and anticipated future losses  the fdic adopted an across the board seven basis point increase in the assessment range for the first quarter of fdic made further refinements to its risk based assessment that were effective april   and effectively made the range to basis points 
the fdic may adjust the scale uniformly from one quarter to the next  except that no adjustment can deviate more than three basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking 
no institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment 
the fdic imposed on all insured institutions a special emergency assessment of five basis points of total assets minus tier capital  as of june  capped at ten basis points of an institution s deposit assessment base on the same date in order to cover losses to the deposit insurance fund 
that special assessment was collected on september  the fdic provided for similar special assessments during the final two quarters of  if deemed necessary 
however  in lieu of further special assessments  the fdic required insured institutions to prepay estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of the estimated assessments  which include an assumed annual assessment base increase of  was recorded as a prepaid expense asset as of december  as of december   and each quarter thereafter  a charge to earnings will be recorded for each regular assessment with an offsetting credit to the prepaid asset 
due to the recent difficult economic conditions  deposit insurance per account owner has been raised to  for all types of accounts until january  in addition  the fdic adopted an optional temporary liquidity guarantee program by which  for a fee  noninterest bearing transaction accounts would receive unlimited insurance coverage until december   subsequently extended until june   and certain senior unsecured debt issued by institutions and their holding companies within a specified time frame would be guaranteed by the fdic through june   or  in certain cases  december  the bank made the business decision to participate in the unlimited noninterest bearing transaction account coverage through december  the bank and the company opted to participate in the unsecured debt guarantee program 
in addition to the assessment for deposit insurance  institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late s by the financing corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund 
that payment is established quarterly and during the four quarters ending december  averaged basis points of assessable deposits 
the fdic has authority to increase insurance assessments 
a significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the bank 
management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
the management of the bank does not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
prompt corrective regulatory action 
the federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an insured depository institution fails to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements  including a leverage limit  a risk based capital requirement and any other measure deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulators for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository institution 
all institutions  regardless of their capital levels  are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees if the institution would thereafter fail to satisfy the minimum levels for any of its capital requirements 
an institution that fails to meet the minimum level for any relevant capital measure an undercapitalized institution may be i subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator  ii required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan within days  iii subject to asset growth limits  and iv required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions  branching and new lines of businesses 
the capital restoration plan must include a guarantee by the institution s holding company that the institution will comply with the plan until it has been adequately capitalized on average for four consecutive quarters  under which the holding company would be liable up to the lesser of of the institution s total assets or the amount necessary to bring the institution into capital compliance as of the date it failed to comply with its capital restoration plan 
a significantly undercapitalized institution  as well as any undercapitalized institution that does not submit an acceptable capital restoration plan  may be subject to regulatory demands for recapitalization  broader application of restrictions on transactions with affiliates  limitations on interest rates paid on deposits  asset growth and other activities  possible replacement of directors and officers  and restrictions on capital distributions by any bank holding company controlling the institution 
any company controlling the institution may also be required to divest the institution or the institution could be required to divest subsidiaries 
the senior executive officers of a significantly undercapitalized institution may not receive bonuses or increases in compensation without prior approval and the institution is prohibited from making payments of principal or interest on its subordinated debt 
at their discretion  the federal banking regulators may also impose the foregoing sanctions on an undercapitalized institution if the regulators determine that such actions are necessary to carry out the purposes of the prompt corrective provisions 
if an institution s ratio of tangible capital to total assets falls below the critically undercapitalized level established by law  ie  a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of or less  the institution will be subject to conservatorship or receivership within specified time periods 
tangible equity is defined as core capital plus cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus less all intangible assets other than qualifying supervisory goodwill and certain purchased mortgage servicing rights 
under the implementing regulations  the federal banking regulators generally measure an institution s capital adequacy on the basis of its total risk based capital ratio the ratio of its total capital to risk weighted assets  tier risk based capital ratio the ratio of its core capital to risk weighted assets and leverage ratio the ratio of its core capital to adjusted total assets 
the following table shows the capital ratios required for the various prompt corrective action categories 
adequately significantly well capitalized capitalized undercapitalized undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio or more or more less than less than tier risk based capital ratio or more or more less than less than leverage ratio or more or more less than less than if institution has a composite camels rating 
the fdic may reclassify a well capitalized depository institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory actions applicable to institutions in the next lower capital category but may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized if the fdic determines  after notice and an opportunity for a hearing  that the savings institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or that the institution has received and not corrected a less than satisfactory rating for any camels rating category 
safety and soundness guidelines 
each federal banking agency was required to establish safety and soundness standards for the depository institutions under its authority 
the interagency guidelines require depository institutions to maintain internal controls and information systems and internal audit systems that are appropriate for the size  nature and scope of the institution s business 
the guidelines also establish certain basic standards for loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure and asset growth 
the guidelines further provide that depository institutions should maintain safeguards to prevent the payment of compensation  fees and benefits that are excessive or that could lead to material financial loss  and should take into account factors such as compensation practices at comparable institutions 
if the appropriate federal banking agency determines that a depository institution is not in compliance with the safety and soundness guidelines  it may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the guidelines 
a depository institution must submit an acceptable compliance plan to its primary federal regulator within days of receipt of a request for such a plan 
failure to submit or implement a compliance plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions 
management believes that the bank meets all the standards adopted in the interagency guidelines 
enforcement 
the fdic has extensive enforcement authority over nonmember insured state banks  including the bank 
this enforcement authority includes  among other things  the ability to assess civil money penalties  issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers 
in general  these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
the fdic has authority under federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank under limited circumstances 
the fdic is required  with certain exceptions  to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non member bank if that banks was critically undercapitalized on average during the calendar quarter beginning days after the date on which the institution became critically undercapitalized 
the fdic may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non member institution under specific circumstances on the basis of the institution s financial condition or upon the occurrence of other events  including insolvency  substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices  existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business  and insufficient capital  or the incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance 
reserve requirements 
under federal reserve board regulations  the bank currently must maintain average daily reserves equal to on aggregate transaction accounts up to and including million  plus on the remainder 
the first million of transaction accounts are exempt 
this percentage is subject to adjustment by the federal reserve board 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in a noninterest bearing account at a federal reserve bank  the effect of the reserve requirement is to reduce the amount of the institution s interest earning assets 
at december   the bank met applicable federal reserve board reserve requirements 
federal home loan bank system 
the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank system  which consists of regional federal home loan banks governed and regulated by the federal housing finance board fhfb

it is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of fhlb system 
it makes loans ie  advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the fhlb system and the board of directors of the fhlb of indianapolis 
loans to executive officers  directors and principal stockholders

state nonmember banks are prohibited from paying the overdrafts of any of their executive officers or directors unless payment is made pursuant to a written  pre authorized interest bearing extension of credit plan that specifies a method of repayment or transfer of funds from another account at the bank 
loans to executive officers may not be made on terms more favorable than those afforded other borrowers and are restricted as to type  amount and terms of credit 
in addition  section of the bhca prohibits extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  and greater than stockholders of a depository institution by any other institution which has a correspondent banking relationship with the institution  unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features

indiana banking law branching 
an indiana bank is entitled to establish one or more branches de novo or by acquisition in any location or locations in indiana and in other states subject to the requirements of federal law for interstate banking 
the bank is required to file an application with the department of financial institutions 
approval of the application is contingent upon the department s determination that after the establishment of the branch  the bank will have adequate capital  sound management and adequate future earnings 
an application to branch must also be approved by the fdic 
lending limits 
indiana banks are not subject to percentage of asset or capital limits on their commercial  consumer and non residential mortgage lending  and accordingly  have more flexibility in structuring their portfolios than federally chartered savings banks 
indiana law provides that a bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a borrower or group of borrowers in excess of of its unimpaired capital and surplus 
an additional of capital and surplus may be lent if secured by specified readily marketable collateral 
enforcement 
the department has authority to take enforcement action against an indiana bank in appropriate cases  including the issuance of cease and desist orders  removal of directors or officers  issuance of civil money penalties and appointment of a conservator or receiver 
other activities 
the bank is authorized to engage in a variety of agency and fiduciary activities including acting as executors of an estate  transfer agent and in other fiduciary capacities 
on approval from the department of financial institutions  the bank would be permitted to exercise any right granted to national banks 
regulatory restructuring legislation 
the obama administration has proposed  and the house of representatives and senate are currently considering  legislation that would restructure the regulation of depository institutions 
proposals range from the merger of the office of thrift supervision  which regulates federal thrifts  with the office of the comptroller of the currency  which regulated national banks  to the creation of an independent federal agency that would assume the regulatory responsibilities of the office of thrift supervision  fdic  office of the comptroller of the currency and federal reserve board 
also  proposed is the creation of a new federal agency to administer and enforce consumer and fair lending laws  a function that is now performed by the depository institution regulators 
enactment of such legislation could revise the regulatory structure imposed on the bank  which could result in more stringent regulation 
at this time  management has no way of predicting the contents of any final legislation  or whether any legislation will be enacted at all 
federal taxation 
the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return on a calendar year end 
saving banks are subject to the provisions of the internal revenue code of the code in the same general manner as other corporations 
however  institutions  such as the bank  which met certain definitional tests and other conditions prescribed by the code benefited from certain favorable provisions regarding their deductions from taxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve 
the company s federal income tax returns have not been audited in the past five years 
state taxation 
the state of indiana imposes a franchise tax which is assessed on qualifying financial institutions  such as the bank 
the tax is based upon federal taxable income before net operating loss carryforward deductions adjusted for certain indiana modifications and is levied at a rate of of apportioned adjusted taxable income 
the company s state income tax returns for the years ended december   and were audited in and no additional taxes were assessed as a result of the audit

risk factors an investment in shares of our common stock involves various risks 
before deciding to invest in our common stock  you should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this form k  including the items included as exhibits 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks or by other risks that have not been identified or that we may believe are immaterial or unlikely 
the value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
our increased emphasis on commercial and construction lending may expose us to increased lending risk 
at december   our loan portfolio consisted of million  or  of commercial real estate loans  million  or  of construction loans  and million  or  of commercial and industrial loans and leases 
we intend to continue to increase our emphasis on the origination of commercial and construction lending 
however  these types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non payment and loss than one to four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property  the income stream of the borrowers and  for construction loans  the accuracy of the estimate of the property s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost of construction 
such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one to four family residential mortgage loans 
commercial and industrial loans expose us to additional risks since they typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayments from the cash flow of the borrower s business and are secured by non real estate collateral that may depreciate over time 
in addition  since such loans generally entail greater risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans  we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future to account for the likely increase in probable incurred credit losses associated with the growth of such loans 
also  many of our commercial and construction borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one to four family residential mortgage loan 
our provision for loan losses increased substantially during the past fiscal year and we may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  each of which could adversely affect our results of operations 
further  our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio 
for  we recorded a provision for loan losses of million 
we also recorded net loan charge offs of million 
we are experiencing increasing loan delinquencies and credit losses 
the deterioration in the general economy and our market area has become a significant contributing factor to the increased levels of loan delinquencies and nonperforming assets as of december  our nonperforming loans totaled million  representing of total loans 
in addition  loans that we have classified as substandard totaled million  representing of total loans 
if these loans do not perform according to their terms and the collateral is insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance  we may experience loan losses  which could have a material effect on our operating results 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date 
however  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect our operating results 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors  including our historical charge off experience  growth of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and classified loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position and estimated collateral values  to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors  including general and economic business conditions  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding our borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments  competitive challenges and other factors 
because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change  our actual losses may vary from our current estimates 
at december   our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 
our regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense  or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge offs  as required by these regulatory agencies  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our cost of operations is high relative to our assets 
our failure to maintain or reduce our operating expenses costs could hurt our profits 
our operating expenses  which consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  furniture and equipment expense  professional fees  data processing expense  fdic insurance premiums and assessments  and marketing  totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we continued our concerted effort to effectively manage our expenses  but experienced the increase in due primarily to higher fdic insurance premiums and assessments  and costs associated with the new banking centers that are part of our indianapolis metropolitan market retail expansion strategy 
although we generated an increase in both net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and noninterest income  we experienced an increase in our efficiency ratio as a result of the higher operating expenses 
our efficiency ratio totaled for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  failure to control our expenses could hurt future profits 
changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings 
our net interest income is the interest we earn on loans and investment less the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
our net interest margin is the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding 
changes in interest rates up or down could adversely affect our net interest margin and  as a result  our net interest income 
although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates  one can rise or fall faster than the other  causing our net interest margin to expand or contract 
our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets  so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates 
as a result  when interest rates rise  our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets  causing our net interest margin to contract until the yield catches up 
changes in the slope of the yield curve or the spread between short term and long term interest rates could also reduce our net interest margin 
normally  the yield curve is upward sloping  meaning short term rates are lower than long term rates 
because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets  when the yield curve flattens or even inverts  we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets 
the building of market share through our branching strategy could cause our expenses to increase faster than revenues 
we opened a full service banking center in fishers in october  a second banking center in carmel in december and a third in westfield in may we also have purchased property in plainfield with the expectation to begin construction on a new full service banking center in there are considerable costs involved in opening branches and new branches generally require a period of time to generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs  especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence 
accordingly  any new branch can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until the branch reaches certain economies of scale 
increased and or special fdic assessments will hurt our earnings 
beginning in late  the economic environment caused higher levels of bank failures  which dramatically increased fdic resolution costs and led to a significant reduction in the deposit insurance fund 
as a result  the fdic has significantly increased the initial base assessment rates paid by financial institutions for deposit insurance 
these increases in the base assessment rate have increased our deposit insurance costs and negatively impacted our earnings 
in addition  in may  the fdic imposed a special assessment on all insured institutions due to recent bank and savings association failures 
our special assessment  which was reflected in earnings for the quarter ended june   was  in lieu of imposing an additional special assessment  the fdic has adopted a rule requiring that all institutions prepay their assessments for the fourth quarter of and all of  and under the rule  the assessment rate for the fourth quarter of and for is based on each institution s total base assessment rate for the third quarter of  modified to assume that the assessment rate in effect on september  had been in effect for the entire third quarter  and the assessment rate for and will be equal to the modified third quarter assessment rate plus an additional basis points 
in addition  each institution s base assessment rate for each period will be calculated using its third quarter assessment base  adjusted quarterly for an estimated annual growth rate in the assessment base through the end of under this rule  we made a payment of million to the fdic on december  we recorded the fourth quarter assessment of  as a charge to earnings  and recorded million as a prepaid expense that will be amortized over the three year assessment period 
if the value of real estate in central indiana were to decline materially  a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under collateralized  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
central indiana has experienced declines in home prices over the past two years 
a further decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the real estate collateral securing our loans 
a continued decline in property values would diminish our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral  making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans 
additionally  a decrease in asset quality could require additions to our allowance for loan losses through increased provisions for loan losses  which would hurt our profits 
also  a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse 
real estate values are affected by various factors in addition to local economic conditions  including  among other things  changes in general or regional economic conditions  governmental rules or policies and natural disasters 
our business is subject to the success of the local economy in which we operate 
since the latter half of  depressed economic conditions have existed throughout the united states  including our market area 
our market area has experienced home price declines  increased foreclosures and increased unemployment rates 
continued deterioration of economic conditions in our market area could reduce our growth rate  affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations 
conditions such as inflation  recession  unemployment  high interest rates  short money supply  scarce natural resources  international disorders  terrorism and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our profitability 
we are less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies 
any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies  foreclosures or losses caused by adverse market or economic conditions in indiana could adversely affect the value of our assets  revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  we cannot give any assurance we will benefit from any market growth or favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas if they do occur 
recent negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets may adversely affect our operations and our stock price 
as a result of the general economic downturn and uncertainty in the financial markets  commercial as well as consumer loan portfolio performances have deteriorated at many institutions and the competition for deposits and quality loans has increased significantly 
in addition  the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages have declined and may continue to decline 
bank and bank holding company stock prices have been negatively affected  as has the ability of banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets compared to recent years 
as a result  there is a potential for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards  and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  including the expected issuance of many formal enforcement orders 
negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets  and the impact of new legislation in response to those developments  may negatively impact our operations by restricting our business operations  including our ability to originate or sell loans  and adversely impact our financial performance or our stock price 
strong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth 
we face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits 
this competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and has occasionally forced us to offer higher deposit rates 
price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits  which reduces net interest income 
according to the fdic  as of june   we held of the deposits in henry county  indiana  which was the largest market share of deposits out of the six financial institutions that held deposits in this county 
we also held of the deposits in hancock county  indiana  which was the fourth largest market share of deposits out of the financial institutions that held deposits in this county 
some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide 
we expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations 
the bank is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the indiana department of financial institutions  its chartering authority  and by the fdic  as insurer of its deposits 
the company is subject to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve board 
such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage  and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and for the depositors and borrowers of the bank 
the regulation and supervision by the indiana department of financial institutions and the fdic are not intended to protect the interests of investors in the company s common stock 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on our operations  the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  legislation or supervisory action  may have a material impact on our operations 
the trading history of our common stock is characterized by low trading volume 
our common stock may be subject to sudden decreases 
although our common stock trades on the nasdaq global market  it has not been regularly traded 
we cannot predict whether a more active trading market in our common stock will occur or how liquid that market might become 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time  which presence is dependent upon the individual decisions of investors  over which we have no control 
the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in interest rates  changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which we operate  press releases  announcements or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in our industry  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors  future sales of our common stock  changes in economic conditions in our marketplace  general conditions in the us economy  financial markets or the banking industry  and other developments affecting our competitors or us 
these factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance  and could prevent you from selling your common stock at or above the price you desire 
in addition  the stock markets  from time to time  experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our trading performance 
failure to comply with the restrictions and conditions in the resolutions adopted by our board at the request of our regulators could result in additional enforcement action against us 
on september   the board of directors of the bank  adopted a resolution agreeing to higher capital requirements  requirements to reduce the level of our classified and criticized assets and restrictions on dividend payments 
these restrictions may impede our ability to operate our business 
additionally  on december   the board of directors of the company  at the request of the federal reserve bank of chicago  adopted a resolution requiring the board to obtain the approval of the federal reserve bank at least thirty days before taking any of the following actions the payment of corporate dividends  the payment of interest on trust preferred securities  any increase in debt or issuance of trust preferred obligations the request for approval should include a written debt service plan indicating how payments will be made without causing further strain on ameriana bank s capital position  and the redemption of ameriana bancorp stock 
the resolution will remain in effect until the federal reserve bank authorizes the board to rescind the resolution 
if we fail to comply with the terms and conditions of the board resolutions  our regulators could take enforcement action against us  including the imposition of further operating restrictions 
these enforcement actions could take the form of a memorandum of understanding or a cease and desist order 
any informal or formal enforcement action could harm our reputation and our ability to retain or attract customers or employees and impact the trading price of our common stock 
we may require additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
we anticipate that we have adequate capital for the foreseeable future 
however  we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support our continued growth or if we incur significant loan or securities impairment 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth could be materially impaired 
provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and indiana law  as well as state and federal banking regulations  could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party 
provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the corporate law of the state of indiana could delay  defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us  despite the possible benefit to our shareholders  or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock 
these provisions include supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations  the election of directors to staggered terms of three years  and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that shareholders may act on at shareholder meetings 
in addition  we are subject to indiana laws  including one that prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any interested shareholder for a period of five years from the date the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met 
these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors

we also invest in various federal and government agency obligations and other investment securities permitted by applicable laws and regulations  including mortgage backed  municipal and equity securities 
we offer customers in our market area time deposits with terms from three months to seven years  interest bearing and non interest bearing checking accounts  savings accounts and money market accounts 
our primary source of borrowings is fhlb advances 
through our subsidiaries  we engage in insurance and investment and brokerage activities 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and the interest expense incurred on our deposits and borrowing portfolios 
our loan portfolio typically earns more interest than the investment portfolio  and our deposits typically have a lower average rate than fhlb advances 
several factors affect our net interest income 
these factors include the loan  investment  deposit  and borrowing portfolio balances  their composition  the length of their maturity  re pricing characteristics  liquidity  credit  and interest rate risk  as well as market and competitive conditions 
financial challenges  strategies and results in recent years in  the company produced net income of million  which represented a million improvement over the million loss recorded in net income in benefited from a million settlement related to our litigation against rli insurance co 
rli over surety guarantees for certain lease pools in which ameriana bank had previously invested 
the positive impact from the rli settlement in was offset in part by million in charge offs  most of which occurred later in the year when the economic climate worsened 
during  the bank continued its balance sheet restructuring strategy that was initiated in late and involved principally the redeployment of funds from lower yielding investment securities into higher yielding loans  and it was the primary reason that net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis improved basis points from for to for as a result of this improvement in net interest margin  we were able to grow net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis by million without the benefit of balance sheet growth  as total assets actually were reduced by million  or 
as part of the bank s efforts to expand its commercial lending capabilities  we opened a commercial lending center in the fast growing suburban area of carmel  indiana 
this office and the bank s continued emphasis on commercial lending contributed to the loan growth realized during the year 
also in  our re branding of the company included the roll out of a new logo and image campaign 
these new initiatives continue to provide significant value to the company moving forward 
in  the company recorded net income of  or  less than net income that benefitted from the rli litigation settlement 
earnings in were negatively impacted by an increase in credit issues related primarily to worsening economic conditions 
the company was successful in the continuation of its balance sheet growth strategy  with total assets increasing by million  or to million 
coupled with this growth was a basis point improvement in the company s net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis to for from a year earlier  which was accomplished primarily through a significant reduction in the bank s funding costs 
loan portfolio growth of million  or in followed the portfolio growth of million in  and in both years was achieved primarily through our greater commercial lending presence in the indianapolis market 
the bank s indianapolis metropolitan market retail expansion strategy was advanced with the opening of banking centers in fishers and west carmel in the last quarter of  and in westfield in may the economic climate became progressively difficult through most of  as the world wide financial crisis reached a peak in the second half of the year 
the severity of this environment and its consequences to the industry created many new formidable challenges for bankers 
executive overview of the company recorded a net loss of  or per share for  which followed net income of  or per share for the results for compared to were negatively impacted by higher credit costs  higher fdic premiums and a special assessment  and higher operating expenses resulting primarily from the bank s retail expansion strategy 
following is additional summary information for the year the company reduced its dividend from per share to per share in the third quarter

all three ratios were considerably above the levels required under regulatory guidelines to be considered well capitalized 
a improvement for in net interest income an a fully tax equivalent basis resulted from higher average earnings assets  as the net interest margin of was unchanged from through balance sheet restructuring and pricing strategies  the company improved its interest rate spread on a fully tax equivalent basis by basis points from at december  to at december  a  year over year increase in the provision for loan losses for to million resulted from the bank s efforts to strengthen the allowance for loan losses due to an increase in non performing loans and charge offs that related primarily to the continuing weak economic environment 
total nonperforming loans of million  or of total loans at december   represented a million increase from million  or of total loans at december  the allowance for loan losses of million  or of total loans at december   represented a million increase over million  or of loans at december  other real estate owned oreo at december  of million was million higher than the total for the prior year end 
the total write downs during of oreo still on the books at year end was  other income of million for was million  or  greater than the total of million for  and resulted primarily from million in gains from sales of investment securities  compared to  during increases generated in various other categories of other income were offset by higher credit costs in other expense of million for was million  or  higher than the total of million for  and was due primarily to the bank s indianapolis retail expansion strategy  and a  increase in fdic insurance expense due mostly to a higher industry wide premium rate coupled with the one time credit being exhausted earlier in the year  and the industry wide second quarter special assessment 
the income tax benefit of  with a pre tax loss of million for was related primarily to a significant amount of tax exempt income from bank owned life insurance and tax exempt interest from municipal securities and loans 
balance sheet restructuring strategies implemented during the second half of resulted in a million  or  decrease in the company s total assets from million at december  to million at december  net loans receivable were million at december   down slightly from million at the end of  as commercial loan demand remained weak and the bank maintained the strategic change adopted earlier in the year of selling fixed rate residential products in the secondary market 
although the yield on the loan portfolio for was basis points lower than  the weighted average interest rate for the loan portfolio at december  represented a decline of only basis points during a low interest rate environment in  compared to a basis point reduction experienced in during  the bank realized a million  or  growth in total deposits to million  with a million increase in non maturity deposits partially offset by a million decrease in certificate accounts 
the decrease in certificate balances was related primarily to the balance sheet restructuring initiative and included a bank planned reduction of million from public funds accounts 
no brokered certificates of deposit were held at december  the bank achieved a basis point reduction in the weighted average cost of deposits to at december  from at the end of a million  or  decrease in the investment portfolio during to million resulted primarily from the bank s balance sheet restructuring and million of principal payments on mortgage backed securities 
the bank continues to sell municipal securities as part of its overall income tax strategy 
as of december   the company did not own fannie mae or freddie mac preferred stock  and did not own private label mortgage backed securities 
as a matter of policy  the company has not originated or purchased sub prime loans 
using funds from the growth in deposits and reduction in the size of the investment portfolio  the bank was able to reduce borrowings from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis by million  and increase short term investments in interest bearing deposits by million from the totals at the end of the prior year 
regulatory action on september   following a joint examination by and discussions with the fdic and the indiana department of financial institutions  the board of directors of the bank adopted a resolution agreeing to  among other things adopt a capital plan to increase its tier leverage ratio to by december  and to at march  and to increase its total risk based capital ratio to by december   adopt a written plan to less classified assets  formulate and implement a written profit plan  receive prior written consent from the fdic and the indiana department of financial institutions before declaring or paying any dividends  strive to reduce total holdings of bank owned life insurance  and furnish quarterly progress reports regarding the bank s compliance with all provisions of the resolution 
strategic summary the current economic downturn has created a challenging operating environment for all businesses  and  in particular  the financial services industry 
management continues its focus on maintaining and improving overall credit quality  liquidity and capital 
earnings pressure is expected to continue as the deterioration in credit quality resulting from the weak economy is likely to continue 
competition for deposits continues to be intense resulting in higher deposit rates while yields on interest earning assets continue to experience downward pressure 
management is also focused on reducing non interest expense through aggressive cost control measures including freezing hiring  job restructuring and eliminating certain discretionary expenditures 
achievement of the company s financial objectives will require obtaining new loans and deposits in our traditional markets  generating significant loan and deposit growth from our new offices in hamilton county and continuing the expansion of our commercial lending strategy in the greater indianapolis metropolitan area 
we believe the long term success of the company is dependent on its ability to provide its customers with financial advice and solutions that assist them in achieving their goals 
we will accomplish this mission by being our customer s first choice for financial advice and solutions  informing and educating customers on the basics of money management  and understanding and meeting customer s financial needs throughout their life cycle 
serving customers requires the commitment of all ameriana bank associates to provide exceptional service and sound advice 
we believe these qualities will differentiate us from our competitors and increase profitability and shareholder value 
to meet our goals  we have undertaken the following strategies build relationships with our customers 
banking is essentially a transaction business 
nevertheless  numerous industry studies have shown that customers want a relationship with their bank and banker based on trust and sound advice 
based on this information  we are focusing our efforts on building relationships and improving our products per household 
achieve superior customer service 
we continually measure customer satisfaction through post transaction surveys 
our evaluations include telephone and in person customer surveys  as well as other in store performance metrics 
we have enhanced our efforts to improve our service by establishing a training department and formalizing our service standards 
develop and deliver fully integrated financial advice and comprehensive solutions to meet customer life events 
we are re packaging our products around customer life events such as planning for retirement  buying a home and saving for college education rather than traditional transaction accounts  savings and consumer loan products 
establish strong brand awareness 
we believe it is important to create a value proposition that is relevant  understood and valued by our customers 
accordingly  we are continuing our efforts through our marketing  customer communications  training  and design of our banking centers to position ameriana bank as a premier service brand 
use technology to expand our customer base 
we continue to enhance our electronic delivery of products and services to our customers 
our technology based services include business sweep products and cash management services  business remote item capture and on line consumer loan and account opening 
these services will allow us to reach more customers effectively and conveniently 
develop an innovative delivery system 
we believe our banking centers must evolve into financial stores that showcase our financial products and offer our customers an environment that is conducive to interacting with knowledgeable ameriana bank associates and with our technology based products 
increase market share in existing markets and expand into new markets 
we believe there is significant opportunity to increase our products per household with existing customers and attract new customers in our existing and new markets 
further  we believe there are opportunities to gain market share in new markets and have developed an expansion strategy to accomplish this 
as part of our expansion strategy  the company opened three new full service banking centers in hamilton county  which lies just north of marion county and indianapolis 
the new offices in fishers  carmel  and westfield opened in october  december  and may  respectively 
in addition  the company has purchased a site in plainfield  which will enhance our presence on the west side of indianapolis and our existing office in avon 
we plan to begin construction of the plainfield office in until economic conditions improve  the bank will not acquire additional locations for development of full service banking centers 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  and such estimates and assumptions are integral to the understanding of reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses provides coverage for probable losses in the company s loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses each month based on changes  if any  in underwriting activities  the loan portfolio composition including product mix and geographic  industry or customer specific concentrations  trends in loan performance  regulatory guidance and economic factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires the use of significant management estimates 
many factors can affect management s estimates of specific and expected losses  including volatility of default probabilities  rating migrations  loss severity and economic and political conditions 
the allowance is increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and reduced by net charge offs 
the company determines the amount of the allowance based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the allowance recorded for commercial loans is based on reviews of individual credit relationships and an analysis of the migration of commercial loans and actual loss experience 
the allowance recorded for non commercial loans is based on an analysis of loan mix  risk characteristics of the portfolio  fraud loss and bankruptcy experiences and historical losses  adjusted for current trends  for each loan category or group of loans 
the allowance for loan losses relating to impaired loans is based on the loan s observable market price  the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans  or the discounted cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate 
regardless of the extent of the company s analysis of customer performance  portfolio trends or risk management processes  certain inherent but undetected losses are probable within the loan and lease portfolio 
this is due to several factors  including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions  the judgmental nature of individual loan evaluations  collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends 
volatility of economic or customer specific conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses for larger  non homogeneous credits and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for homogenous groups of loans are among other factors 
the company estimates a range of inherent losses related to the existence of these exposures 
the estimates are based upon the company s evaluation of risk associated with the commercial and consumer allowance levels and the estimated impact of the current economic environment 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights msrs associated with loans originated and sold  where servicing is retained  are capitalized and included in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the value of the capitalized servicing rights represents the present value of the future servicing fees arising from the right to service loans in the portfolio 
critical accounting policies for msrs relate to the initial valuation and subsequent impairment tests 
the methodology used to determine the valuation of msrs requires the development and use of a number of estimates  including anticipated principal amortization and prepayments of that principal balance 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates  mortgage loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the carrying value of the msrs is periodically reviewed for impairment based on a determination of fair value 
impairment  if any  is recognized through a valuation allowance and is recorded as amortization of intangible assets 
valuation measurements 
valuation methodologies often involve a significant degree of judgment  particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued 
investment securities and residential mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value  as defined in sfas no 
fair value measurement sfas no 
 which requires key judgments affecting how fair value for such assets and liabilities is determined 
in addition  the outcomes of valuations have a direct bearing on the carrying amounts for goodwill and intangibles assets 
to determine the values of these assets and liabilities  as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired  management makes assumptions and estimates related to discount rates  asset returns  prepayment rates and other factors 
the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results  which could affect the company s results of operations 
income tax accounting 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return 
the provision for income taxes is based upon income in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on our deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
under us gaap  a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning our evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  our forecasts of future income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
positive evidence includes the existence of taxes paid in available carry back years  available tax strategies  as well as the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods  while negative evidence includes any cumulative losses in the current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends 
at december  and december   we determined that our existing valuation allowance was adequate  largely based on available tax planning strategies and our projections of future taxable income 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
any required increase to the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination 
the benefit of an uncertain tax position is initially recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority  assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
differences between our position and the position of tax authorities could result in a reduction of a tax benefit or an increase to a tax liability  which could adversely affect our future income tax expense 
we believe our tax policies and practices are critical accounting policies because the determination of our tax provision and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities have a material impact our net income and the carrying value of our assets 
we believe our tax liabilities and assets are adequate and are properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements at december  financial condition total assets decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to balance sheet restructuring strategies that were implemented during the second half of cash and cash equivalents total cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  from million at december  cash on hand and in other institutions increased million  or  to million at december  this change was primarily due to a million increase in our book balance for the noninterest earning piece of our federal reserve bank account  which represents electronic deposits not yet credited 
interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to million at december   as the bank deposited some of the cash proceeds from the december sales of investment securities into its overnight investment account at the federal reserve bank 
securities investment securities available for sale decreased to million at december  from million at december  this million decrease was due primarily to sales of municipal securities  and sales and principal repayments on mortgage backed securities that exceeded new purchases 
municipal securities decreased to million through total sales of million that were designed primarily to support the bank s income tax strategies 
principal repayments and sales  offset by million of purchases  reduced the total fair value of ginnie mae and gse mortgage backed pass through securities by million to million at december  the sales related mostly to the balance sheet restructuring strategies 
all mortgage backed securities at december  are insured by either ginnie mae  fannie mae or freddie mac 
at december   all investments remained classified as available for sale 
all of our investments are evaluated for other than temporary impairment  and such impairment  if any  is recognized as a charge to earnings 
there were no other than temporarily impaired investment securities as of december the following table identifies changes in the investment securities carrying values dollars in thousands change change december ginnie mae and gse mortgage backed pass through securities ginnie mae collateralized mortgage obligations municipal securities mutual funds totals the following table identifies the percentage composition of the investment securities december ginnie mae and gse mortgage backed pass through securities ginnie mae collateralized mortgage obligations federal agencies municipal securities mutual funds totals see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on investment securities 
loans net loans receivable totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from million at december  the lack of portfolio growth was due primarily to the impact of the weak economy on commercial loan demand  coupled with management s decision to sell a significant portion of new single family mortgage loans in the secondary market 
residential real estate loans increased  to million at december   from million at december  new production involved a mix of owner occupied single family and investment property loans  as well as a blend of products that included both fixed rate and variable rate pricing 
during  the bank originated million in residential real estate loans  including home equity loans  and sold million into the secondary market 
additionally  the bank acquired million of in market loans through a broker 
commercial real estate loans increased million to million at december   from million at december  commercial loans and leases increased million to million at december  from million at december  the overall growth in these two categories of commercial loans for was due to increased penetration by our lenders in the local market areas  particularly the indianapolis market 
commercial real estate and other commercial loans added in totaled million  with million in originations and million in purchases 
the bank s construction loans  which consist primarily of commercial properties  decreased million to million during due primarily to the weaker economy 
construction loans added in totaled million

new loans totaled million in  with million repaid before the end of the year 
consumer loans declined  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily due to a net paydown of  in automobile loan balances that was due to decreased demand resulting primarily from poor economic conditions 
the bank originated million of consumer loans in new loan volume in totaled million  compared to million in new residential loans  including million of construction loans  increased to million in from million in commercial loan  commercial real estate  commercial construction  and municipal loan additions in totaled million compared to million in new consumer loans totaled million in compared to million in we generally retain loan servicing on loans sold 
loans we serviced for investors  primarily freddie mac  fannie mae and the federal home loan bank of indianapolis  totaled approximately million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease resulted from a continued weak residential mortgage market during with pay downs and payoffs on existing serviced loans exceeding the dollar amount of new serviced loans 
loans sold that we subsequently service generate a steady source of fee income  with servicing fees ranging from to per annum of the loan principal amount 
credit quality nonperforming loans increased million to million at december  from million at december  the increase was due primarily to the classifications of a retail center loan in fishers  indiana  and a warehouse office building and adjoining land loan in indianapolis totaling million  and an increase on our single family residential nonperforming loans 
we recorded net charge offs of million in  compared to net charge offs of  in total charge offs were million and million in and  respectively 
total recoveries in were  while total recoveries were  in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans was at december  and at december  although there was a significant increase in nonperforming loans in the bank s loan portfolio during due primarily to the continuing weak economy  as a result of our review of collateral positions and historic loss ratios  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover all incurred and probable losses inherent in the portfolio at december  goodwill the  increase in goodwill from  at december  to  at december  resulted from the june  purchase of an insurance agency book of business 
 of the goodwill reported for both dates relates to deposits associated with a banking center acquired on february  the results of the bank s impairment tests have reflected a fair value for the deposits at this banking center that exceeds the goodwill  and a fair value of the two insurance agency books of business purchased that exceeds the associated goodwill 
cash value of life insurance we have investments in life insurance on employees and directors  with a balance or cash surrender value of million and million  respectively  at december  and the majority of these policies were purchased in some policies with lower returns were exchanged in as part of a restructuring of the program 
the nontaxable increase in cash surrender value of life insurance was  in  compared to  in deposits the following table shows deposit changes by category dollars in thousands change change december  noninterest bearing deposits savings deposits now deposits money market deposits certificates  and more other certificates totals non maturity deposits increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  million of the increase related to checking accounts  noninterest bearing and interest bearing  with million representing growth in public funds checking balances 
the growth in non maturity deposits resulted primarily from the bank s increased focus on sales activities coupled with its banking center expansion strategy  and the reaction of individuals to safer investments due to market conditions related to the depressed economic environment 
certificates of deposit decreased million primarily as a result of our decision not to renew three state of indiana public funds investments totaling million  as part the bank s balance sheet restructuring strategy implemented during the second half of borrowings borrowings decreased million to million at december  from million at december  as the bank relied more on core deposits to fund portfolio lending  and also due to the restructuring strategy implemented in the second half of the year that resulted in a reduction in the size of the bank s balance sheet 
at december   our borrowings consisted of fhlb advances totaling million  one million repurchase agreement  and subordinated debentures in the amount of million

total shareholders equity was also reduced in by a  net loss and the payment of  in dividends 
results of operations compared to net income the company recorded a net loss of  for  or per diluted share  compared to net income of  or per diluted share  for this decrease of million was due primarily to higher credit costs resulting from continuing weak economic conditions  higher fdic insurance premiums and assessments  and higher operating expenses resulting from adding de novo banking centers

total interest expense for decreased million compared to  as the bank took advantage of market opportunities to reprice and sharply reduce its cost of interest bearing deposits  and reduced total borrowings as part of its balance sheet restructuring strategy

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents the current period credit or cost associated with maintaining an appropriate allowance for loan losses 
periodic fluctuations in the provision for loan losses result from management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  assessment by management  third parties and banking regulators of the quality of the loan portfolio  the value of the underlying collateral on problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market area 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we had a provision for loan losses of million for compared to a provision of million for the provisions for both and reflected the increase in nonperforming loans and charge offs  and the increasing pressure of current economic conditions on credit quality 
the allowance to total loans ratio was at december   compared to at december  other income the million increase in total other income in as compared to resulted primarily from the following items a  or  increase in brokerage and insurance commissions that resulted mostly from the mid year acquisition of the book of business of a local insurance agency  a net gain of million from million in sales of available for sale investment securities in  compared to a net gain of  in from million in sales 
the sales related mostly to the balance sheet restructuring strategies implemented in the second half of the year   in gains from million in sales of loans and the imputed value of the associated servicing rights realized in  compared to  in gains from million in sales in the relatively stable low interest rate environment in contributed to a higher volume of refinancing activity for single family residential mortgage loans than in   in oreo income from the operation of an apartment complex compared to none for in  the bank began upgrading some of the units and using other marketing efforts to increase the occupancy rate to make the apartment complex more attractive to potential buyers  a  gain from the liquidation of a minority interest in family financial  a  increase in other income that was due primarily to a  reduction in losses from unconsolidated subsidiaries to  in from  in  of the loss resulted from the sale of the title insurance company that the bank had jointly owned with two other financial institutions 
the benefit from the reduction in losses from unconsolidated subsidiaries was partially offset by a  increase in the amortization of originated mortgage loan servicing rights due mostly to the higher volume of refinancing activity 
the change in total other income in compared to was negatively impacted by million in net losses on other real estate owned and other repossessed assets for  compared to  in other expense the million  or  increase in total other expense for compared to  resulted primarily from the acceleration of the bank s indianapolis retail expansion strategy  a higher required pension plan contribution  higher fdic insurance premiums  and oreo expense the million total cost for salaries and employees benefits for was  higher than  due mostly to compensation costs related to the three new banking centers  a  increase in employee health insurance costs  and a  increase in funding costs for the frozen multi employer defined benefit retirement plan 
the increase in salaries would have been materially greater without the benefit from the elimination of other positions primarily through attrition 
the  increase in office occupancy expense and  increase in furniture and equipment expense were also due mostly to costs associated with the two new banking centers that opened during the fourth quarter of  the new banking center that opened in may of  and the major banking center remodel that was completed in september of a  increase in legal and professional fees to  that resulted primarily from higher legal fees  mostly related to the abstract title guaranty company  inc litigation  a  increase in fdic insurance premiums and assessments that was related primarily to higher net premiums due to industry wide increases and the exhaustion of the one time credit  coupled with the industry wide special assessment that resulted in a  second quarter expense for the bank  a  increase in data processing expense to  that resulted primarily from a greater use of the existing electronic services  as well as new electronic services provided by the bank  a  increase in other real estate owned expense related primarily to real estate taxes and to operating expenses for the oreo apartment complex that provided  of rental income during  and a  increase in other expense from million for to million for was due primarily to a  penalty resulting from the prepayment of a federal home loan bank borrowing that was part of the bank s balance sheet restructuring strategy  a  increase in directors fees resulting from special meetings and the addition of a new director  a  increase in loan expense that resulted mostly from economic conditions  and a  increase in expenses associated with repossessed non real estate property   in amortization expense recorded in related to the fair value of the intangible assets associated with the purchased insurance agency book of business  reduced by a  decrease in educational expense  that resulted primarily from the shift in of sales training expense to the marketing budget

the income tax benefit for also included a  reversal of an income tax liability recorded in prior years that resulted from a favorable tax court ruling regarding the application of the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act penalty to investment subsidiaries of commercial banks 
we have a deferred state tax asset of million that is primarily the result of operating losses sustained since for state tax purposes 
we started recording a valuation allowance against our current period state income tax benefit in due to our concern that we may not be able to use more than the tax asset already recorded on the books without modifying the use of aimi  our investment subsidiary  which was liquidated effective december  operating income from aimi was not subject to state income taxes under state law  and is the primary reason for the tax asset 
the valuation allowance was  at december  the company had a deferred federal tax asset of million at december   that was composed of million of tax benefit from a net operating loss carryforward of million  million related to temporary differences between book and tax income  and million in tax credits 
the federal loss carryforward expires in  and the tax credits begin to expire in included in the million of tax credits available to offset future federal income tax are approximately  of alternative minimum tax credits which have no expiration date 
management believes that the company will be able to utilize the benefits recorded for loss carryforwards and credits within the allotted time periods 
the bank has initiated several strategies designed to expedite the use of both the deferred state tax asset and the deferred federal tax asset  in addition to the liquidation of aimi  our investment subsidiary  as stated above 
through a series of sales of tax exempt municipal securities  that segment of the investment portfolio has already been reduced by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  the proceeds from these sales have been reinvested in taxable financial instruments 
the bank is considering a sale leaseback transaction that could result in a significant taxable gain on its office properties  and also allow the bank to convert nonearning assets to earnings assets that will produce taxable income 
additionally  the bank is exploring options related to reducing its current investment in tax exempt bank owned life insurance policies  that involve the reinvestment of the proceeds in taxable financial instruments with a similar or greater risk adjusted after tax yield 
sales of banking centers not important to long term growth objectives that would result in taxable gains and reduced operating expenses could be considered by the bank 
the effective tax rate was in  which resulted from a million loss before income taxes coupled with an  income tax benefit  compared to an effective tax rate of  for that resulted from a  loss before income taxes and a  income tax benefit 
the primary difference in the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rates in both and relates to cash value of life insurance and municipal securities income

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future obligations of a short term nature 
historically  funds provided by operations  loan repayments and new deposits have been our principal sources of liquid funds 
in addition  we have the ability to obtain funds through the sale of new mortgage loans  through borrowings from the fhlb system  and through the brokered certificates market 
we regularly adjust the investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities and the objectives of our asset liability program 
the company is a separate entity and apart from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
in addition to its operating expenses  the company is responsible for the payment of dividends declared for its shareholders and the payment of interest on its subordinated debentures 
at times  the company has repurchased its stock 
substantially all of the company s operating cash is obtained from subsidiary service fees and dividends 
payment of such dividends to the company by the bank is limited under indiana law 
additionally  as part of a resolution adopted by the board of directors of the bank on september   the bank cannot declare or pay any dividends without the prior written consent of the fdic and the indiana department of financial institutions 
see regulatory action 
the company believes that such restriction will not have an impact on the company s ability to meet its ongoing cash obligations 
at december   we had million in loan commitments outstanding and million of additional commitments for line of credit receivables 
certificates of deposit due within one year of december  totaled million  or of total deposits 
if these maturing certificates of deposit do not remain with us  other sources of funds must be used  including other certificates of deposit  brokered cds  and borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than currently paid on the certificates of deposit due on or before december  however  based on past experiences we believe that a significant portion of the certificates of deposit will remain 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
we held no brokered cds at either december  or december  our primary investing activities are the origination of loans and purchase of securities 
in  our loan originations totaled million  and we also purchased million of loans from a broker and purchased three loans totaling million from other financial institutions 
financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts and fhlb advances

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
this requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or at the same rate as changes in the prices of goods and services  which are directly affected by inflation  although interest rates may fluctuate in response to perceived changes in the rate of inflation 
current accounting issues on july   the accounting standards codification became fasb s officially recognized source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles applicable to all public and non public non governmental entities  superseding existing fasb  aicpa  eitf and related literature 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under the authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all other accounting literature is considered non authoritative 
the switch to the asc affects the way companies refer to us gaap in financial statements and accounting policies 
citing particular content in the asc involves specifying the unique numeric path to the content through the topic  subtopic  section and paragraph structure 
fasb asc topic  determining whether instruments granted in shared based payment transaction are participating securities 
in june  the fasb issued the fsp which clarifies that unvested share based payment awards with a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends are participating securities

under asc topic  declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses to the extent the impairment is related to credit losses

contingent consideration is required to be recognized and measured at fair value on the date of acquisition rather than at a later date when the amount of that consideration may be determinable beyond a reasonable doubt 
this fair value approach replaces the cost allocation process required under previous accounting guidance whereby the cost of an acquisition was allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value 
asc topic requires acquirers to expense acquisition related costs as incurred rather than allocating such costs to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as was previously the case under prior accounting guidance 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are to be recognized at fair value if fair value can be reasonably estimated 
if fair value of such an asset or liability cannot be reasonably estimated  the asset or liability would generally be recognized in accordance with asc topic  contingencies 
under asc topic  the requirements of asc topic  exit or disposal cost obligations  would have to be met in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting
