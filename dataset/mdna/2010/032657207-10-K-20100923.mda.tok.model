see risk factors in item a for a discussion of the primary risks and uncertainties known to us at this time 
our management s discussion and analysis is presented in six sections as follows business overview fiscal year overview results of operations liquidity and capital resources critical accounting policies new accounting pronouncements we report our financial condition and results of operations on a fiscal year basis ending july all dollar amounts in this item are in thousands except per share data 

table of contents business overview analogic is a high technology company that designs and manufactures advanced medical imaging and security systems and subsystems sold to oems and end users primarily in the healthcare and airport security markets 
we were incorporated in the commonwealth of massachusetts in november and are recognized worldwide for advancing state of the art technology in the areas of medical ct  mri  digital mammography  specialized ultrasound  and eds for airport security 
our oem customers incorporate our technology into systems they in turn sell for various medical and security applications 
we also sell our ultrasound products directly into specialized clinical end user markets through our direct worldwide sales force under the brand name b k medical 
we operate primarily within two major markets medical technology and security technology 
medical technology consists of three reporting segments ct and mri  digital radiography  and specialized ultrasound 
a significant portion of our products are sold to oems  whose purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales 
oems that purchase our ct and mri and digital radiography products generally incorporate those products as components in their systems  which are in turn sold to end users  primarily hospitals and medical clinics 
in our security technology business  a major oem customer purchases and resells our products to end users including domestic and foreign airports as well as the u 
s transportation security administration tsa 
in security technology  our oem customers purchasing dynamics are affected by the level of government funding  the expansion of airport terminals and fluctuations in airline passenger volume 
fiscal year overview the following is a summary of the matters that our management believes are most important in understanding our results of operations for the periods indicated 
this summary is not a substitute for the detail provided in the following pages or for the audited consolidated financial statements and notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
percentage change fiscal year total net revenue income loss from operations   n a operating margin percentage net income diluted net income per share the increase in net revenue  income from operations  net income  and diluted net income per share in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily reflected the improvement in hospital spending on capital equipment  which drove increased demand in our medical technology business  the impact of new innovative products in both medical technology and security technology  and a diligent focus on cost containment and operational efficiency  which enabled the positive recovery from the downturn of fiscal year we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of  and  at july  and  respectively 
the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents over the past month continued to be impacted by the global decline in interest rates 
we have historically invested primarily in u 
s government backed securities  bonds  and certificates of deposit 
the interest rates of these instruments have declined significantly over the last year 
the following table sets forth an overview of cash flows for fiscal years and year ended july  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents during fiscal year  our cash from our operating activities improved notably from fiscal year due primarily to the significant increase in income from operations of  on higher revenues and operating margins 
the net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year was due primarily to the maturity of  of short term held to maturity marketable securities  which was partially offset by property  plant  and equipment additions of  and an investment in an affiliate of  the net cash used for financing activities in fiscal year was due primarily to  of dividends paid to stockholders 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenue product revenue product revenue for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year is summarized in the table below 
year ended july  percentage change product revenue medical technology ct and mri digital radiography specialized ultrasound total medical technology security technology total ct and mri the increase in product revenue for our ct and mri segment for fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to increases in demand by our oem customers as a result of the improvement in hospital spending on capital equipment  as well as the impact of new products introduced in fiscal year digital radiography the increase in product revenue for digital radiography products for fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to increased shipments of mammography detectors to oem customers outside the united states 
as of july   our major oem customer for mammography detectors had not yet received clearance from the united states food and drug administration to market their system  which incorporates our selenium based detector  in the united states 
specialized ultrasound the increase in specialized ultrasound product revenue in fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to increases in demand for our new product lines  the flex focus and pro focus ultraview ultrasound scanners  which were introduced late in the second and third quarters of fiscal year  respectively  the improvement in hospital spending on capital equipment in general  and expansion of our direct sales force 
security technology the decrease in product revenue for security technology in fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to the fluctuating demand by our oem customer as a result of changing requirements and procurement

provision benefit for income taxes year ended july  provision benefit for income taxes effective tax rate for fiscal year  the effective tax rate of as compared to the us statutory rate of was due primarily to lower foreign tax rates and discrete benefits of approximately  due primarily to the reversal of tax reserves as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations for fiscal years and in fiscal year and the settlement of foreign and domestic tax audits 
also contributing to the reduced effective tax rate were federal research and experimentation credits 
for fiscal year  the benefit for income taxes was due primarily to irs refunds of  received in fiscal year the refunds  which included  of interest  were for the carryback of a loss and research 
table of contents and development credits from fiscal year and from additional research and development tax credits and timing items claimed on amended income tax returns for fiscal years through we had recognized  of these refunds and related interest within stockholders equity in fiscal year the impact of these refunds and related interest was a reduction of unrecognized tax benefits by approximately  of which  was recorded as a tax benefit in fiscal year also contributing to the benefit for income taxes in fiscal year was  for the reversal of a valuation allowance on belgium net operating loss carryforwards that management has determined are more likely than not to be recognized and the reversal of of tax reserves due to the expiration of statutes of limitations 
these benefits were partially offset by additional provisions for agreed federal and state adjustments and typical taxes owed related to our operations in that period 
net income and diluted net income per share net income and diluted net income per share for fiscal years and were as follows year ended july  net income of net revenue diluted net income per share the increase in net income and diluted net income per share for fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to increases in sales volumes and gross margins driven by increased demand in the medical technology business

table of contents full year impact of net revenue from the copley business  which was acquired in april  and accounted for  and  of product revenue in fiscal year and  respectively 
digital radiography the increase in product revenue for digital radiography for fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to an increase in shipments of mammography detectors to an oem customer partially offset by the winding down of non mammography product sales to another oem customer 
we expect this business to transition primarily to the sale of mammography detectors in fiscal year specialized ultrasound the decrease in specialized ultrasound product revenue in fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to unfavorable changes in the foreign currency exchange rate and a decline in demand due to the global economic slowdown 
also contributing to the decrease were customer order delays in anticipation of the introduction of two new ultrasound product lines  one of which we introduced late in the second quarter of fiscal year  and the other of which we introduced late in the third quarter of fiscal year security technology the decrease in product revenue for security technology in fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to a decrease in sales of spare parts and accessories of approximately  the decrease was partially offset by more baggage scanners being shipped in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year engineering revenue engineering revenue for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year is summarized in the table below

fiscal year percentage of net revenue research and product development selling and marketing general and administrative restructuring and voluntary retirement charges total operating expenses research and product development expenses decreased  for fiscal year versus the prior year 
the decrease was due primarily to an increase in customer funded engineering projects whose costs are recorded in engineering cost of sales 
also contributing to the decrease were reductions in our workforce late in fiscal year and during fiscal year to align our cost structure with market conditions as well as lower performance based incentive compensation expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of copley in april  which accounted for research and product development expenses of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively

our effective tax rate for fiscal year included benefits of and from foreign operations and the us domestic production deduction  respectively  as well as a benefit of for the us research and experimentation credit  which expired on december  these benefits were offset by a provision due to an increase in tax reserves 
net income and diluted net income per share net income and diluted net income per share for fiscal year and fiscal year were as follows year ended july  net income of net revenue diluted net income per share 
table of contents the decrease in net income and diluted net income per share for fiscal year versus the prior year were due primarily to declines in sales volumes  gross margins  and interest income  as well as an increase in the amount of restructuring charges in fiscal year versus the prior year comparable period 
these factors were partially offset by a benefit from income taxes and a decline in the weighted average shares outstanding due to the common stock repurchase program completed in the second quarter of fiscal year liquidity and capital resources key liquidity and capital resources information is summarized in the table below 
july  july  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital short and long term debt stockholders equity the increase in working capital from july  to july  was due primarily to increases in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  accounts receivable  and inventories  of   and  respectively  reflecting increased sales volumes and increased customer demand during fiscal year we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investments are impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns 
we believe that our cash equivalents were appropriately valued at july  and we are not aware of any market events that would impact their valuation 
this could change in the future should new developments arise in the credit markets 
we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  and changes in interest rates 
these exposures can change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposure is related to fluctuations between the us dollar and local currencies for our subsidiaries in canada and europe 
our investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
a depreciation in the july  and functional currencies  relative to the us dollar  would result in a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately and  respectively 
the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  and trade payables approximate fair value at july   due to the short maturities of these instruments 
cash and cash equivalents totaled  at july  and consisted entirely of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the time of purchase 
cash flows the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash over the periods indicated year ended july  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents the cash flows generated from operating activities in fiscal year primarily reflects our pre tax earnings of  which included depreciation and amortization expenses of  and non cash share based compensation expense of  the impact of our operating earnings on cash flows were partially offset by increases in accounts receivables  inventories  and other assets of   and  respectively  net of a decrease in refundable incomes taxes of  and increases in accounts payable and accrued income taxes of  and  respectively 
accounts receivable increased primarily due to growth in unbilled receivables on engineering projects throughout fiscal year and increased revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year inventories increased due primarily to an increase in customer demand and production volumes in part associated with the transition of certain manufacturing activities to our recently established subsidiary in shanghai  china 
the increase in other assets was due primarily to an advance paid as part of a technology development arrangement  which is expected to be repaid over the next nine months according to the development plan that includes milestones and increases in deferred engineering costs 
the decrease in refundable income taxes was due primarily to income tax refunds that were received in fiscal year the increase in accounts payable was due primarily to the timing of vendor payments and an increase in inventories due to increased customer demand and production volumes 
the increase in accrued income taxes was due to the increase in income earned in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year was due primarily to the maturity of  of short term held to maturity marketable securities  which was partially offset by property  plant  and equipment additions of  and an investment in an affiliate of net cash used for financing activities in fiscal year consisted primarily of  for dividends paid to stockholders 
we believe that our balances of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  and cash flows expected to be generated by future operating activities will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
commitments  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements our contractual obligations at july   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods are as follows contractual obligation total less than year years more than years years more than years operating leases purchasing obligations as of july   the total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions were  due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties  we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions 
therefore  these amounts have not been included in the contractual obligations table 
we currently have approximately  in revolving credit facilities with banks available for direct borrowings 
our revolving credit facility agreements contain a number of covenants  including a covenant requiring us to maintain a tangible net worth as defined in the revolving credit facility agreement of no less than  as of the end of any fiscal quarter 
we were in compliance with this covenant at july  with a 
table of contents tangible net worth of approximately  as of july   we had no direct borrowings or off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb released the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles the codification  effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  the codification does not change accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  but does significantly change the way in which the accounting literature is organized  combining all authoritative standards in a comprehensive  topically organized database 
all existing accounting standards documents were superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the codification is considered nonauthoritative  other than guidance issued by the sec 
we adopted the provisions of this guidance during the quarter ended october   which had no impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
business combinations and noncontrolling interests effective august   we adopted fasb guidance that requires an acquiring entity in a business combination to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition date fair values  changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  changes the recognition and measurement of contingent consideration  and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
this guidance also requires additional disclosure of information surrounding a business combination  such that users of the entity s financial statements can more fully understand the nature and financial impact of the business combination 
this guidance applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   which is our fiscal year effective august   we adopted fasb guidance that establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest  and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
this guidance also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners

effective august   we adopted fasb guidance amending the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and requiring enhanced related disclosures 
the guidance improves the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset 
this guidance must be applied prospectively to all intangible assets acquired as of and subsequent to fiscal years beginning after december  although future transactions involving intangible assets may be affected by this guidance  it did not impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows during fiscal year effective august   we adopted fasb guidance that amends and clarifies the initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting  and related disclosures of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial statements will largely depend on the size and nature of any business combinations 

table of contents fair value effective august   we adopted fasb guidance requiring disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim and annual reporting periods and is effective for interim reporting periods ending after june  the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

revenue recognition in october  the fasb issued an amendment which eliminates the residual method of allocation for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the amendment also establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which includes vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  and estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
additionally  the amendment expands the disclosure requirements related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this amendment is effective for us on august   however  we elected to early adopt as permitted by the amendment and have prospectively applied the provisions of the amendment to all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after july  the adoption of the amendment did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
see note in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in october  the fasb issued an amendment which amends the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements  such that tangible products containing both software and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of software revenue guidance 
this amendment was effective for us on august   however  we elected to early adopt as permitted by the amendment and have prospectively applied the provisions of the amendment to all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after july  the adoption of the amendment did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
not yet effective special purpose entities in june  the fasb issued guidance that eliminates the concept of a qualified special purpose entity and related guidance  creates more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale  clarifies other sale accounting criteria  and changes the initial measurement of a transferor s interest in transferred financial assets 
this guidance is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after november  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued guidance that requires former qualified special purpose entities to be evaluated for consolidation  changes the approach to determining a variable interest entity s vie primary beneficiary  and requires companies to more frequently reassess whether they must consolidate vies 
this guidance is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after november  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
revenue recognition in march  the fasb issued guidance related to revenue recognition that applies to arrangements with milestones relating to research or development deliverables 
this guidance provides criteria that must be met to recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
this guidance is effective for us on august  and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our most critical accounting policies  and the estimates involved in their application  have a significant impact on the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
these policies involve significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expense  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continue to evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
by their nature  the policies discussed below require management to make its most difficult and subjective estimates and judgments  often on matters that are inherently uncertain 
our estimates and judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies  see note  summary of business operations and significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item  exhibits and financial statements schedule  of this annual report on form k 
we believe the following accounting policies require management to make the most difficult estimates and judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accordingly are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
revenue recognition policy we provide engineering services to some of our customers on a contractual basis and generally recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method 
we generally estimate the progress towards completion on contracts with a fixed fee arrangement on a monthly basis utilizing costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs at completion of the project or on a milestone basis based on contractual terms  as appropriate 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately 
judgments and uncertainties our revenue recognition accounting methodology for engineering services with a fixed fee arrangement involves uncertainties because it requires management to make estimates of our total estimated costs at completion of projects 
the timing of when revenue  profits  and loss reserves are recognized may fluctuate if changes to the estimates of costs at completion of projects are needed 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine our estimated costs at completion of projects during the past three fiscal years 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

table of contents allocation of consideration in multiple element revenue arrangements policy we allocate arrangement consideration to each deliverable in an arrangement based on its relative selling price 
we determine selling price using vsoe  if it exists  and otherwise tpe 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a unit of accounting  we use esp 
we generally expect that we will not be able to establish tpe due to the nature of the markets in which we compete  and  as such  we typically will determine selling price using vsoe or if not available  esp 
if we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  and the order was received or materially modified after july   we use esp in the allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact if the product or service were sold by us on a standalone basis 
judgments and uncertainties our determination of esp involves a weighting of several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of the arrangement 
specifically  we will consider the cost to produce the deliverable  the anticipated margin on that deliverable  the selling price and profit margin for similar parts  our ongoing pricing strategy and policies as evident in the price list as established and updated on a regular basis  the value of any enhancements that have been built into the deliverable and the characteristics of the varying markets in which the deliverable is sold 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions there is no risk of difference between the esp and actual selling price since an actual selling price does not exist for the deliverables in these arrangements 
inventory reserves policy we value our inventory at the lower of the cost of the inventory or fair market value through the establishment of inventory reserves 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  product life cycles  and changes in technology 
a variety of methodologies are used to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary for excess and obsolete inventory 
reserves are based upon the age of the inventory  lower of cost or market  along with significant management judgments concerning future demands for the inventory 
if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates  or we experience a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  additional reserves for existing inventories might be recorded in future periods 
once recorded  inventory valuation reserves are not subsequently reversed until the inventory is used or disposed of 
judgments and uncertainties our inventory reserves involve uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging  forecasted customer demand  and technological obsolescence 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our inventory reserves during the past three fiscal years 
if estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
a difference in our actual reserves at july   would have affected net earnings by approximately in fiscal year share based compensation policy we have share based compensation plans  which include stock options and unvested restricted stock awards  and an employee stock purchase plan 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes valuation model and the fair value of the company s restricted stock awards  which include shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units  based on the quoted market price of its common stock or the use of a monte carlo simulation model 
we recognize the associated share based compensation expense for time based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of the awards  net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeiture rates are estimated based 
table of contents on historical pre vesting forfeitures and are updated on the vesting dates to reflect actual forfeitures 
the amount of share based compensation expense for performance based unvested restricted stock awards that is recognized on a straight line basis over the performance period is based upon the number of shares that management ultimately expects to vest 
for performance based awards with an earnings per share related target  management evaluates the probability of meeting the performance criteria at each balance sheet date and related compensation cost is amortized over the performance period on a straight line basis because such awards vest only at the end of the measurement period 
changes to the probability assessment and the estimate of shares expected to vest will result in adjustments to the related share based compensation expense that will be recorded in the period of the change 
if the performance is not achieved  no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed 
for performance based awards with a market condition related target  related compensation cost is amortized over the performance period on a straight line basis  net of estimated forfeitures  regardless of whether the awards are ultimately earned 
judgments and uncertainties option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
performance based non vested restricted stock awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company or personal performance goals 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and the amount of compensation expense we recognize 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to determine our share based compensation expense during the past three fiscal years 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  particularly those used in determining the accrual percentage for performance based non vested restricted stock awards  we may be exposed to changes in share based compensation expense that could be material 
a change in our share based compensation expense for the year ended july   would have affected net earnings by approximately in fiscal year warranty reserves policy we estimate the costs of product warranties based on specific warranty claims  historical data  and engineering estimates  where applicable 
judgments and uncertainties our warranty reserve involves uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions based on specific warranty claims  historical data  and engineering estimates  where applicable 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our warranty reserves during the past three fiscal years 
if actual product failure rates or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
such revisions could adversely affect our operating results 
a change in our warranty reserve at july   would have affected net earnings by approximately in fiscal year purchase price allocation for business combinations policy we apply the purchase accounting method to account for business combinations  which requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to assign the purchase price to the fair value of the assets and liabilities purchased  with the excess value  if any  being classified as goodwill 
for those assets with finite lives  useful lives are assigned to those intangibles and their values are amortized over their remaining life 

table of contents judgments and uncertainties our purchase price allocation methodology involves uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates  including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions during the last three fiscal years  we completed one significant acquisition  which was the acquisition of copley in april for  including transaction costs 
see note  business combination  to the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report on form k  for the complete purchase price allocation 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  accelerated amortization for intangible assets with finite lives or impairment charges for intangible assets or goodwill could be required 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets policy we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable 
we conduct our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses  which consider both the market approach and income approach for goodwill and the relief from royalty approach for the indefinite lived intangible assets 
under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on trading and acquisition multiples 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the relief from royalty approach  the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is based on after tax royalty rate and discount rate applied to future forecasted sales 
in the second quarter of fiscal years and  we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets using the methodologies described herein  and determined there was no impairment 
the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets related to the acquisition of copley at july  were  and  respectively 
judgments and uncertainties the valuation analyses described above involve uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as our future expectations 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
a change in our calculation of the reporting unit s fair value at december  would have had no effect on net earnings in fiscal year income tax contingencies policy our income tax returns  like those of most companies  are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we record a liability for exposures subject to a minimum threshold of more likely than not before any benefit is recognized 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a liability  is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

table of contents in fiscal year  we adopted guidance  which requires management to perform a two step evaluation of all tax positions  ensuring that these tax return positions meet the more likely than not recognition threshold and can be measured with sufficient precision to determine the benefit recognized in the financial statements 
these evaluations provide management with a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements certain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on our income tax returns 
judgments and uncertainties our liability for unrecognized tax benefits involves uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability  the effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
deferred tax valuation allowances policy we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions within which we operate 
this process involves assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that recovery is not more than likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
judgments and uncertainties our effective income tax rate is affected by changes in tax law  the tax jurisdiction of new business ventures  the level of earnings  and the results of tax audits 
our deferred tax valuation allowances involve uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions based on historical data  future book income  and tax planning strategies 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our deferred tax asset valuation allowances during the past three fiscal years 
in the event that actual results differ from the estimates and assumptions we use in determining our effective tax rate  the provision for income taxes and results of operations could be materially impacted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all dollar amounts in this item a are in thousands 
certain of our foreign operations enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency  primarily the us dollar and the euro 
we also have foreign currency exposure arising from the translation of our net equity investment in our foreign operations to us dollars 
we generally view our investments in foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar as long term 
the currencies to which we are exposed are the british pound  chinese yuan  canadian dollar  danish kroner  and euro 
a depreciation in the july  and functional currencies  relative to the us dollar  would result in a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately and  respectively 
we place our cash investments in high quality financial instruments and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution 
our cash and investments include cash equivalents  which we 
table of contents consider to be investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
investments having original maturities in excess of three months are stated at amortized cost  which approximates fair value  and are classified as held to maturity 
total interest income for fiscal year was an interest rate change of would not have a material impact on the fair value of our portfolio or on future earnings
