revenues and loss before income tax benefit in millions attributable to discontinued operations for fiscal years  and are as follows 
table of contents fiscal year ended april  revenues income loss before income taxes in fiscal year  the company acquired two solid waste hauling operations 
these transactions were in exchange for total consideration of million  including million in cash and million in notes payable to the seller and liabilities assumed 
in fiscal year  we acquired three solid waste hauling operations in exchange for million in cash consideration 
general revenues our revenues in our eastern  central and western regions are attributable primarily to fees charged to customers for solid waste disposal and collection  landfill  landfill gas to energy  waste to energy  transfer and recycling services 
we derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial  industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
the majority of our residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual households 
landfill  waste to energy facility and transfer customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our disposal facilities and transfer stations 
recycling revenues  which are included in fcr recycling and the central and western regions  consist of revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities and operations and maintenance contracts of recycling facilities for municipal customers 
we also generate and sell electricity under a contract at our waste to energy facility and at certain of our landfill facilities 
our cellulose insulation business is conducted through a joint venture with louisiana pacific corporation  and accordingly  we recognize half of the joint venture s net income on the equity method in our results of operations 
the company also has a interest in a company that markets an incentive based recycling service and a interest in a surety company which provides surety bonds to the company to secure contractual performance for municipal solid waste collection contracts and landfill closure and post closure obligations 
the company accounts for these investments under the cost method of accounting 
also  in the other segment  we have ancillary revenues including major customer accounts

we typically establish our inter company transfer pricing based upon prevailing market rates 
the table below shows  for the periods indicated  the percentages and dollars in millions of revenue attributable to services provided 
fiscal year ended april  collection disposal power generation processing and recycling solid waste operations major accounts fcr recycling total revenues the dollar decrease in collection revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily due to lower volumes and fuel surcharges  partially offset by price increases and the effect of a tuck in acquisition 
disposal and power generation revenues were down slightly due primarily to lower volumes but increased as a percentage of total revenues in the fiscal year ended compared to fiscal year  mainly because of the decrease in total revenues due to lower fcr recycling revenues 

table of contents major accounts revenues increased due to increased volume 
as noted above  fcr recycling revenues were negatively impacted as a result of a sharp decline in average commodity prices in fiscal year compared to fiscal year operating expenses cost of operations includes labor  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  fuel  maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment  workers compensation and vehicle insurance  the cost of purchasing materials to be recycled  third party transportation expense  district and state taxes  host community fees and royalties

depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight line method  amortization of landfill airspace assets under the units of consumption method  and the amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill using the straight line method 
we amortize landfill retirement assets through a charge to cost of operations using a straight line rate per ton as landfill airspace is utilized 
the amount of landfill amortization expense related to airspace consumption can vary materially from landfill to landfill depending upon the purchase price and landfill site and cell development costs 
we depreciate all fixed and intangible assets  other than goodwill  to a zero net book value  and do not apply a salvage value to any fixed assets 
we capitalize certain direct landfill development costs  such as engineering  permitting  legal  construction and other costs associated directly with the expansion of existing landfills 
additionally  we also capitalize certain third party expenditures related to development projects and pending acquisitions  such as legal and engineering costs 
we routinely evaluate all such capitalized costs  and expense those costs related to projects not likely to be successful 
internal and indirect landfill development and acquisition costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
we will have material financial obligations relating to capping  closure and post closure costs of our existing landfills and any disposal facilities which we may own or operate in the future 
we have provided  and will in the future provide  accruals for these future financial obligations based on engineering estimates of consumption of permitted landfill airspace over the useful life of any such landfill 
there can be no assurance that our financial obligations for capping  closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds

landfill amortization expense decreased by million primarily due to lower volumes and the planned closure of our colebrook and pinetree facilities 
depreciation and intangible amortization expense increased million year over year primarily due to the company s landfill energy project and investments in fcr recycling single stream projects 
the decrease in deferred taxes in fiscal year versus was primarily associated with the deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in a million decrease 
assets and liabilities  net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures  increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year accounts receivable amounted to a million decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to higher revenues 
accounts payable in fiscal year amounted to million of cash provided compared with million used in the prior year due primarily to higher operating costs associated with higher business levels 
lower restricted cash amounts at april  due to the liquidation of assets held in trust as collateral for the company s financial obligations relative to its self insurance claims liability amounted to million cash provided in fiscal prepaid expenses  inventories and other assets amounted to cash provided of million in fiscal year compared to cash provided of million in fiscal year accrued expenses and other liabilities amounted to cash used of million in fiscal year compared to cash used of million in fiscal year the decrease in cash used of million is due primarily to the following reductions associated with higher payroll accruals at april  amounting to million  higher accrued interest at april  associated with higher interest rates and the timing of borrowings amounting to million and changes in accrued expenses amounting to million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year compared to million used in investing activities in fiscal year the decrease in cash used in investing activities was due to lower capital expenditures in fiscal year of million  lower acquisition activity in the current year amounting to million  higher proceeds from sale of equipment in fiscal year amounting to million  lower investments in unconsolidated entities in fiscal year versus fiscal year amounting to million  offset by higher fiscal year payments on landfill operating lease contracts amounting to a million increase in cash used 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal year compared to million used in financing activities in fiscal year the increase in cash used relates primarily to deferred financing fees associated with the refinancing as discussed above offset by higher net borrowings 
in fiscal year  we acquired two solid waste hauling operations 
these transactions were in exchange for total consideration of million  including million in cash and million in notes payable to the seller and liabilities assumed 
in fiscal year  we acquired three solid waste hauling operations in exchange for million in cash consideration 
for the landfill operating lease contracts  we made payments totaling million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we generally meet our liquidity needs from operating cash flow and our senior secured credit facility 
these liquidity needs are primarily for capital expenditures for vehicles  containers and landfill development  debt service costs and capping  closure and post closure expenditures and acquisitions 
we have reacted to recent economic conditions by managing various expense categories and capital expenditures 
continued weakness in the economy will likely result in 
table of contents negative pressure on consumer and business spending  which could result in lower future business volumes and resulting cash flows 
we use a variety of strategies to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the commodity prices  including entering into fixed price contracts and entering into hedges which mitigate the variability in cash flows generated from the sales of recycled paper at floating prices  resulting in a fixed price being received from these sales 
as of april   to minimize the company s commodity exposure  the company was party to seventeen commodity hedging agreements 
for further discussion on commodity price volatility  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price volatility below 
we have filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec 
we may from time to time issue securities thereunder in an amount of up to million 
our ability and willingness to issue securities pursuant to this registration statement will depend on market conditions at the time of any such desired offering and therefore we may not be able to issue such securities on favorable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of april  in thousands and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years fiscal year s ending april  thereafter total long term debt financing lease obligations interest obligations operating leases capping closure post closure total contractual cash obligations interest obligations based on debt and capital lease balances as of april  interest obligations related to variable rate debt were calculated using variable rates in effect at april  includes obligations related to landfill operating lease contracts 
contractual cash obligations do not include accounts payable or accrued liabilities  which will be paid in fiscal year in addition to the above obligations  we have unrecognized tax benefits at april  of approximately million 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the unrecognized tax benefits at april   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the timing of cash settlements 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
consistent with industry practice  most of our contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
we have implemented a fuel surcharge program  which is designed to recover fuel price fluctuations 
we therefore believe we should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors may require us to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases  particularly during periods of high inflation 
our business is located mainly in the eastern united states 
therefore  our business  financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region  such as state regulations and severe weather conditions 
we are unable to forecast or determine the timing and or the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 

table of contents limitations on ownership of notes pursuant to the first paragraph of section of the indenture governing the second lien notes  no beneficial holder of the second lien notes is permitted to knowingly acquire second lien notes if such person would own or more of our consolidated debt for which relevant subsidiaries of the company are obligated and must dispose of second lien notes or other debt of ours to the extent such person becomes aware of exceeding such threshold  if such ownership would require consent of any regulatory authority under applicable law or regulation governing solid waste operators and such consent has not been obtained 
we have agreed that  for so long as any of the second lien notes remain outstanding  we will furnish to the holders of the second lien notes  in each quarterly and annual report  the dollar amount of our debt that would serve as the threshold for evaluating a beneficial holder s compliance with these ownership restrictions 
as of april   that dollar amount was million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances 
our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in note b to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
landfills the cost estimates for capping  closure and post closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes 
we also estimate additional costs based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally 
we estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each capping event and the timing of construction related to each capping event and of closure and post closure activities 
because landfill capping  closure and post closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques  changes in the estimated timing of construction of future landfill capping and closure and post closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities  related assets and results of operations 
landfill development costs we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity 
this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation  excavation for airspace  landfill leachate collection systems  landfill gas collection systems  environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas  directly related engineering  capitalized interest  on site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs 
additionally  landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property 
the projection of these landfill costs is dependent  in part  on future events 
the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized  net of accumulated airspace amortization  and projections of future purchase and development costs 
landfill capping costs capping includes installation of liners  drainage  compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace has been consumed and waste is no longer being received 
capping activities occur throughout the life of the landfill 
our engineering personnel estimate the cost for each capping event based on the acreage to be capped and the capping materials and activities required 
the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
the engineers then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each capping event and the costs for each event are amortized over that capacity as waste is received at the landfill 
landfill closure and post closure closure and post closure costs represent future estimated costs related to monitoring and maintenance of a solid waste landfill  after a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes 
we estimate  based on input from our engineers  
table of contents accounting personnel and consultants  our future cost requirements for closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the subtitle d regulations and the air emissions standards under the clean air act as they are being applied on a state by state basis 
significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in determining estimated future closure and post closure costs  we consider costs associated with permitted and expansion airspace 
remaining permitted airspace our engineers  in consultation with third party engineering consultants and surveyors  are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills 
the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey  which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 
expansion airspace we include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances 
to be considered expansion airspace all of the following criteria must be met we control the land on which the expansion is sought  all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained  we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor  we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received  and senior management has approved the project 
for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace  the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above 
these criteria are annually evaluated by our engineers  accountants  managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits 
once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards  an airspace utilization factor  or auf  is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons 
the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys 
when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace  we also include the projected costs for development  as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to capping  and closure and post closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 
after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills  we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons 
we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each capping event  for assets related to closure and post closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future 
these rates per ton are updated annually  or more often  as significant facts change 
it is possible that actual results  including the amount of costs incurred  the timing of capping  closure and post closure activities  our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions 
to the extent that such estimates  or related assumptions  prove to be significantly different than actual results  lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates  higher capping  closure or post closure rates  or higher expenses  or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs 
most significantly  if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset  we may be required to recognize an asset impairment 
if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote  the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 
environmental remediation liabilities recorded environmental liabilities represent our estimate of the most likely outcome of the matters for which we have determined liability is probable 
these liabilities include potentially responsible party  or prp  investigations  
table of contents settlements  certain legal and consultant fees  as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up  such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy 
we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred based on site specific facts and circumstances 
estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are developed using third party environmental engineers or other service providers 
goodwill and other intangibles we assess goodwill impairment annually at the end of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year by applying a fair value test 
to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as a whole we use discounted cash flow analyses  which require significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit 
significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the determination of appropriate discount rates  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates 
the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are based on financial forecasts developed internally by management 
our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of our risk adjusted discount rate applicable for each reporting unit 
in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values of our reporting units  we evaluate our results against our current market capitalization 
in addition  we would evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment 
see note b to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
recovery of long lived assets we conduct a review of our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of such assets might warrant revision or that the balances may not be recoverable 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment about factors such as general economic condition  and projected growth  and our estimates often vary from the cash flows eventually realized 
if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the net book value of long term assets including amortizable intangible assets  further analysis is performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment 
in such circumstances an impairment loss would be recorded equal to the amount by which the net book value of the assets exceeds fair value 
fair value is usually determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
self insurance liabilities and related costs we are self insured for vehicles and workers compensation 
the liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is determined by management with the assistance of a third party actuary and reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as an accrued liability 
our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or severity of future events differ significantly from our assumptions 
new accounting standards adoption of new accounting pronouncements fair value measurements and disclosures in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fair value measurement guidance to allow reporting entities to defer for one year the effective date of previously issued guidance as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
this additional guidance does not defer recognition and disclosure requirements for financial assets and financial liabilities or for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are remeasured at least annually 
effective may   the company adopted the fair value guidance with respect to non financial assets and liabilities measured on a non recurring basis 
the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
business combinations in december  the fasb issued new guidance on business combinations  which revised previous guidance on 
table of contents accounting for business combinations and retains the fundamental concept of the purchase method of accounting and introduces new requirements for the recognition and measurement of assets acquired  liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests 
this guidance also requires acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs to be expensed rather than treated as part of the cost of the acquisition 
this guidance applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the company s adoption date 
the company adopted this guidance on may  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
derivatives and hedging disclosures in march  the fasb issued guidance which amends and expands the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this guidance requires entities to provide enhanced qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative disclosures about fair values and amounts of gains and losses on derivative contracts and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements 
the company adopted this guidance on may  as this guidance relates specifically to disclosures  the adoption had no impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
intangible assets in april  the fasb issued guidance on determining the useful life of intangible assets 
this guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
this guidance is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value 
the company adopted this guidance on may  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
subsequent events in may  the fasb issued guidance on subsequent events which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
this guidance addresses the period after the balance sheet date during which the management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
the company adopted this guidance during the quarter ended july  the company evaluated subsequent events through the date the accompanying financial statements were available to be filed 
new accounting pronouncements pending adoption variable interest entities in june  the fasb issued guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity vie and requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
under this guidance  an enterprise has a controlling financial interest when it has i the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and ii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
this guidance requires an enterprise to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a vie operates as designed when determining whether it has power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
this guidance also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  requires enhanced disclosures and eliminates the scope exclusion for qualifying special purpose entities 
this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november  the company does not believe the impact of adopting this guidance will have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate volatility we had interest rate risk relating to approximately million of long term debt under the new revolver at april  the interest rate on the variable rate portion of this debt was approximately at april  should the average interest rate on the variable rate portion of this debt change by basis points  our annual interest expense would increase or decrease by million 
the remainder of our long term debt is at fixed rates and not subject to interest rate risk 
commodity price volatility through our fcr recycling operation  we market a variety of materials  including fibers such as old corrugated cardboard occ and old newsprint onp  plastics  glass  ferrous and aluminum metals 
we use a number of strategies to mitigate impacts from commodity price fluctuations  such as indexed purchases  floor prices  fixed price agreements  and revenue share arrangements 
in addition  as of april  we were party to commodity hedge contracts that manage pricing fluctuations on a portion of our occ and onp volumes 
these contracts expire between august and december we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we expect to be able to replace our expiring hedges with existing or new counterparties  however  the availability and pricing terms at any given time will be subject to prevailing market conditions 
if commodity prices were to have changed by in the year ended april   the impact on our operating income is estimated to have been between million and million based on the observed impact of commodity price changes on operating income margin during the years ended april  and april  our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices is complex because each customer contract is unique relative to revenue sharing  tipping or processing fees and other arrangements 
the above estimated ranges of operating income impact may not be indicative of future operating results and actual results may vary materially
