item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  and item a  ldq uo  interest rates  included herein  for additional information on the risks associated with our financing arrangements 
economic conditions general economic conditions may continue to impact our revenue and operating results according to the national bureau of economic researc h  the united states economy was in a recession from december until june it is widely believed that certain elements of the economy  such as housing  auto sales and employment  were in decline before december  and have still not recovered to pre recession levels 
 and revenue  operating results and cash flows were significantly impacted by the recession 
the duration and depth of an economic recession  and pace of economic recovery  in markets in which we operate may influence our future results 
operating revenue our revenue may not return to historical levels a significant portion of our revenue is derived from advertising 
the demand for advertising is sensitive to the overall level of economic activity  both locally and nationally 
operating revenue in most categories decreased in  and and may decrease in the future 
such decreases may not be offset by growth in advertising in other categories  such as digital revenue which  until  had been rising significantly and began to rise again in historically  newspaper publishing has been viewed as a cost effective method of delivering various forms of advertising 
there can be no guarantee that this historical perception will guide future decisions on the part of advertisers 
web sites and applications for mobile devices distributing news and other content continue to gain popularity 
as a result  audience attention and advertising spending are shifting and may continue to shift from traditional media to digital media 
we expect that advertisers will allocate greater portions of their future budgets to digital media  which can offer more measurable returns than traditional print media through pay for performance and keyword targeted advertising 
to the extent that advertisers shi ft advertising expenditures to other media outlets  including those on the internet  the profitability of our business may continue to be impacted 
the rates we charge for advertising are  in part  related to the size of the audience of our publications and digital products 
there is significant competition for readers and viewers from other media 
our business may be adversely affected to the extent individuals decide to obtain news  entertainment  classified listings and local shopping information from internet based or other media  to the exclusion of our outlets for such information 

table of contents retail advertising many advertisers  including major retail store chains  automobile manufacturers and dealers  banks and telecommunications companies  have experienced significant merger and acquisition activity over the last severa l years  and some have gone out of business  effectively reducing the number of brand names under which the merged entities operate 
our retail revenue is also being impacted by the current economic environment 
for example  a decline in the housing market negatively impacts retail advertising related to home improvement  furniture and home electronics 
classified advertising classified advertising is the category that has been most significantly impacted by the current economic environment 
in  as the recession ac celerated  employment classified advertising  including both print and digital  declined as unemployment increased 
this trend began to reverse in in  and  real estate classified advertising also suffered declines due primarily to cyclical issues  such as declining sale prices and an increase in unsold homes  affecting the residential real estate market nationally 
in this decline accelerated due to the access to  and limitations on  residential mortgage funding 
automotive classified advertising revenue declined in  and  due to industry wide issues affecting certain domestic auto manufacturers and the overall decline in economic conditions leading to the last recession 
see item  advertising  included herein  for additional information on the risks associated with advertising revenue 
circulation though our overall audience is growing and our circulation unit results have historically benchmarked favorably to national averages  as compiled by the abc  circulation unit sales have nonetheless been declining fractionally for several years 
the possibility exists that future circulation price increases may be difficult to accomplish as a result of future declines in circulation unit sales  and that price decreases may be necessary to retain or grow circulation unit volume 
we are reaching increasingly larger audiences through stable newspaper readership and rapid digital audience growth 
nonetheless  declines in circulation unit sales could also adversely impact advertising revenue 
in addition  as audience attention increasingly focuses on digital media  circulation of our newspapers may be adversely affected  which may decrease circulation revenue and exacerbate declines in print advertising 
if we are not successful in growing our digital businesses to offset declines in revenues from our print products  our business  financial condition and prospects will be adversely affected 
see item  audiences  included herein  for additional information on the risks associated with circulation revenue 
operating expenses we may not be able to reduce future expenses to offset potential revenue declines we reduced operating expenses  excluding depreciation  amortization  impairment charges and other unusual costs  by  or  in  by  or  in and by  or  in such expense reductions are not expected to significantly impact our ability to deliver advertising and content to our customers 
as a result of the significant reductio ns of our cost structure we have achieved since  future cost reductions will be more difficult to accomplish 
operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  are expected to increase less than 
newsprint comprises a significant amount of our operating costs 
see item  newsprint and item a  commodities included herein  for additional information on the risks associated with changes in newsprint costs 
goodwill and other intangible assets we may incur additional non cash impairment charges we have significant amounts of goodwill and identified intangible assets 
in and  we recorded substantial impairment charges to reduce the value of certain of these assets 
should general economic  market or business conditions decline  and have a negative impact on our stock price or cash flows  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in the future 
see item  critical accounting policies  included herein  for additional information on the risks associated with su ch assets 

table of contents equity capital a decrease in our stock price may limit the ability to trade our stock or for the company to raise equity capital as of december   our common stock traded at an average day closing market price of less than per share 
under the nyse listing standards  if our common stock fails to maintain an adequate per share price and total market capitalization  our common stock could be removed from the nyse and traded in the over the counter market 
in december  the nyse notified us that our common stock did not meet the nyse continued listing standard due to the failure to maintain an adequate share price 
sub sequent to that date  the nyse temporarily suspended the standard through july  and extended our six month cure period until december in september  the nyse notified us that our average share price had risen sufficiently to cure the share price deficiency 
we may be able to mitigate the effect of a low stock price in the future through implementation of a reverse stock split 
all of these factors  along with volatile equity market conditions  could limit our ability to raise new equity capital in the future

our newspapers and other publications have formal or informal backup arrangements for printing in the event of a disruption in production capability 
item legal proceedings we are involved in a variety of legal actions that arise in the normal course of business 
insurance coverage mitigates potential loss for certain of these matters 
while we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these legal actions  it is our opinion that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements  taken as a whole 
in  a group of newspaper carriers filed suit against us in the united states district court for the southern district of california  claiming to be employees and not independent contractors of ours 
the plaintiffs seek relief related to vi olation of various employment based statutes  and request punitive damages and attorneys fees 
in july  the trial court judge granted the plaintiffs petition for class certification 
we filed an interlocutory appeal which was denied 
discovery in the case will proceed in the normal course and we intend to bring a motion to reverse the class certification ruling upon completion of that process 
at this time we are unable to predict whether the ultimate economic outcome  if any  could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  taken as a whole 
we deny the allegations of employee status  consistent with our past practices and industry practices  and intend to vigorously contest the action  which is not covered by insurance

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations and financial condition as of  and for each of the three years ended  september  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  included herein 
non gaap financial measures no non gaap financial measure should be considered as a substitute for any related financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
however  we believe the use of non gaap financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information with which to evaluate our financial performance  or assist in forecasting and analyzing future periods 
we also believe such non gaap financial measures are alternative indicators of performance used by investors  lenders  rating agencies and financial analysts to estimate the value of a publishing business or its ability to meet debt service requirements 
operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin operating cash flow  which is defined as operating income loss before depreciation  amortization  impairment of goodwill and other assets  curtailment gains and equity in earnings of associated companies  and operating cash flow margin operating cash flow divided by operating revenue represent non gaap financial measures that are used in the analysis below 
we believe these measures provide meaningful supplemental information because of their focus on results from operations excluding such non cash factors 
reconciliations of operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin to operating income loss and operating income loss margin  th e most directly comparable measures under gaap  are included in the table below thousands of dollars percent of revenue percent of revenue percent of revenue operating cash flow depreciation and amortization td style vertical align bottom  padding left px  padding top px  padding b ottom px  impairment of goodwill and othe r assets nm curtailment gains equity in earnings of associated companies reduction in investment in tni operating income loss nm nm adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share  which are defined as income loss attributable to lee enterprises  incorporated and earnings loss per common share adjusted to exclude both unusual matters and those of a substantially non recurring nature  are non gaap financial measures that are used in the analysis below 
we believe these measures provide meaningful supplemental information by identifying matters that are not indicative of 
table of contents core business operating results or are of a substantially non recurring nature 
reconciliations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share to income loss attributable to lee enterprises  incorporated and earnings loss per common share  respectively  the most directly comparable measures under gaap  are set forth in item  included herein  under the caption overall results 
same property comparisons certain information below  as noted  is presented on a same property basis  which is exclusive of acquisitions and divestitures  if any  consummated in the current or prior year 
we believe such comparisons provide meaningful supplemental information for an understanding of changes in our revenue and operating expenses 
same property comparisons exclude tni and mni 
we own of tni and also own of the capital stock of mni  both of which are reported using the equity method of accounting 
same property comparisons also exclude corporate office costs 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additional informa tion follows with regard to certain of the most critical of our accounting policies 
goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets  we make a determination of the fair value of our business 
fair value is determined using a combination of an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon future revenue  expenses and cash flows discounted to their present value  and a market approach  which estimates fair value using market multiples of various financial measures compared to a set of comparable public companies in the publishing industry 
a non cash impairment charge will generally be recognized when the carrying amount of the net assets of the business exceeds its estimated fair value 
the required valuation methodology and underlying financial information that are used to determine fair value require significant judgments to be made by us 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  long term projections of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows 
changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
we analyze goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators are present 
such indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  changes in business climate and operating or cash flow losses related to such assets 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein  for a more detailed explanation of our intangible assets 
due primarily to the continuing  and at the time increasi ng difference between our stock price and the per share carrying value of our net assets  we analyzed the carrying value of our net assets in and again in deterioration in our revenue and the overall recessionary operating environment for us and other publishing companies were also factors in the timing of the analyses 
as a result  we recorded pretax  non cash charges to reduce the carrying value of goodwill  nonamortized and amortizable intangible assets in and additional pretax  non cash charges were recorded to reduce the carrying value of tni 
we also recorded pretax  non cash charges to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment in  and we recorded deferred income tax benefits r elated to these charges 

table of contents a summary of impairment charges is included in the table below thousands of dollars goodwill nonamortized intangible assets amortizable intangible assets property and equipment reduction in investment in tni we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
we assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or asset group with their carrying amount 
the impairment amount  if any  is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
we also periodically evaluate our determination of the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets 
any resulting changes in the useful lives of such intangible assets will not impact our cash flows 
however  a decrease in the useful lives of such intangible assets would increase future amortization expense and decrease future reported operating results an d earnings per common share 
at september   our fair value exceeds carrying value 
based on substantial impairment charges recorded in both and  and the most recent testing performed at september   we do not believe our reporting unit is at risk of failing future goodwill impairment testing 
however  future decreases in our market value  or significant differences in revenue  expenses or cash flows from estimates used to determine fair value  could affect this determination 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit plans we evaluate our liability for pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit plans based upon computations made by consulting actuaries  incorporating estimates and actuarial assumptions of future plan service costs  future interest costs on projected benefit obligations  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates  expected investment returns on plan assets  asset allocation assumptions of plan assets  and other factors  as applicable 
if we used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans  the funded status of the plans could vary significantly  resulting in recognition of different amounts of expense over future periods 
increases in market interest rates  which may impact plan assumptions  generally result in lower service costs for current employees  higher interest expense and lower liabilities 
actual returns on plan assets that are lower than the plan assumptions will generally result in decreases in a plan s funded status and may necessitate additional contributions 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided using the liability method  whereby deferred income tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
recent changes in accounting for uncert ain tax positions can result in additional variability in our effective income tax rate 
we file income tax returns with the internal revenue service irs and various state tax jurisdictions 
from time to time  we are subject to routine audits by those agencies  and those audits may result in proposed adjustments 
we have considered the alternative interpretations that may be assumed by the various taxing agencies  believe our positions taken regarding our filings are valid  and that adequate tax liabilities have been recorded to resolve such matters 
however  the actual outcome cannot be determined with certainty and the difference could be material  either positively or negatively  to the consolidated statements of operations and compreh ensive income loss in the periods in which such matters are ultimately determined 
we do not believe the final resolution of such matters will be material to our consolidated financial position or cash flows 

table of contents revenue reco gnition advertising revenue is recorded when advertisements are placed in the publication or on the related digital product 
circulation revenue is recorded as newspapers are distributed over the subscription term 
other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered 
unearned revenue arises in the ordinary course of business from advance subscription payments for publications or advance payments for advertising 
uninsured risks we are self insured for health care  workers compensation and certain long term disability costs of our employees  subject to stop loss insurance  which limits exposure to large claims 
we accrue our estimated health care costs in the period in which such costs are incurred  including an estimate of incurred but not reported claims 
other risks are insured and carry deductible losses of varying amounts 
our accrued reserves for health care and workers compensation claims are based upon estimates of the remaining liability for retai ned losses made by consulting actuaries 
the amount of workers compensation reserve has been determined based upon historical patterns of incurred and paid loss development factors from the insurance industry 
an increasing frequency of large claims  deterioration in overall claim experience or changes in federal or state laws affecting our liability for such claims could increase the volatility of expenses for such self insured risks 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in  we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  consolidation 
fasb asc requires that noncontrolling interests be reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
net income loss including the portion attributable to our noncontrolling interests is included in net income loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss and will continue to be used to determine earnings loss per common share 
fasb asc also requires certain prospective changes in accounting for noncontrolling interests primari ly related to increases and decreases in ownership and changes in control 
as required  the presentation and disclosure requirements were adopted through retrospective application  and prior period information has been reclassified accordingly 
adoption of fasb asc did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in  we adopted fasb staff position fsp r  disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets  codified in asc  compensation retirement benefits 
fsp r requires additional disclosures relating to investment strategies  major categories of plan assets  concentrations of risk within plan assets and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets 
adoption of fsp r did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

the present value of the redemption in february was approximately in february  in conjunction with the notes amendment  pd llc redeemed the interest in pd llc and ds llc owned by herald pursuant to a redemption agreement and adopted conforming amendments to the operating agreement 
as a result  the value of herald s former interest the herald value will be settled  at a date determined by herald between april and april  based on a calculation of of the fair market value of pd llc and ds llc at the time of settlement  less the balance  as adjusted  of the pulitzer notes or the equivalent successor debt  if any 
we recorded a liability of  in as an estimate of the amount of the herald value to be disbursed 
the determination of the amount of the herald value was based on an estimate of fair value using both market and income based approaches 
the actual amount of the herald value at the date of settlement will depend on such variables as future cash flows and indebtedness of pd llc and ds llc  market valuations of newspaper properties and the timing of the request for redemption 
cash settlement of the herald value is limited by the terms of the credit agreement

we had no excess cash flow in or we had excess cash flow of approximately  in and  as a result  paid  originally due under the a term loan in march and june the acceleration of such payments due to asset sales or excess cash flow does not change the due dates of other a term loan payments 
covenants and other matters the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for financing of its type 
at september   we were in compliance with such covenants 
these financial covenants include a maximum total leverage ratio  as defined 
the total leverage ratio is based primarily on the sum of the princip al amount of debt  which totals  at september   plus letters of credit and certain other factors  divided by a measure of trailing month operating results  which includes several elements  including distributions from tni and mni and curtailment gains 
the amendments amended our covenants to take into account economic conditions and the changes to amortization of debt noted above 
our total leverage ratio at september  was under the amendments  our maximum total leverage ratio limit will decrease from in september to in december  decrease to in march  decrease to in june and decrease to in september each change in the maximum total leverage ratio noted above is effective on the last day of the quarter 
the credit agreement also includes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio  as defined  which is based on the same measure of trailing month operating results noted above 
our interest expense coverage ratio at september  was the minimum interest expense coverage ratio is in september  and will increase periodically thereafter until it reaches in march the amendments required us to suspend stockholder dividends and share repurchases through april the amendments also limit capital expenditures to  per year  with a provision for carryover of unused amounts from the prior year 
further  the amendments modify other covenants  including restricting our ability to make additional investments and acquisitions without the consent of the lenders  limiting additional debt beyond that permi tted under the credit agreement  and limiting the amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents the credit parties may hold to a maximum of  for a five day period 
such covenants require that substantially all of our future cash flows be directed toward debt reduction 
finally  the amendments eliminated an unused incremental term loan facility

the notes amendment provides that the obligations under the pulitzer notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by pulitzer s existing and future subsidiaries excluding star publishing and tni 
also  as a result of the notes amendment  pulitzer and each of its subsidiaries pledged substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets  and granted mortgages covering certain real estate  as collateral for the payment and performance of their obligations under the pulitzer notes 
assets and stock of star publishing  our ownership interest in tni and certain employee benefit plan assets are excluded 
the notes amendment increased the rate paid on the outstanding principal balance to until april   at which time it increased to 
the interest rate will increase by per year thereafter 
pulitzer may voluntarily prepay principal amounts outstanding or reduce commitments under the pulitzer notes at any time  in whole or in part  without premium or penalty  upon proper notice and consent from the noteholders and the lenders  and subject to certain limitations as to minimum amounts of prepayments 
the notes amendment provides for mandatory scheduled prepaymen ts  including quarterly principal payments of  beginning on june  
table of contents and an additional principal payment from restricted cash of  in october in and  all payments due were made prior to the end of the previous fiscal quarter 
in addition to the scheduled payments  we are required to make mandatory payments under the pulitzer notes under certain other conditions 
the notes amendment requires us to apply the net proceeds from asset sales to repayment of the pulitzer notes 
in  we made a  payment related to this provision 
the notes amendment establishes a reserve of restricted cash of up to  which was reduced to  in october to facilitate the liquidity of the operations of pulitzer 
all other previously existing restricted cash requirements were eliminated 
the notes amendment allocates a percentage of pulitzer s quarterly excess c ash flow as defined between pulitzer and the credit parties and requires prepayments to the noteholders under certain specified events 
in  a principal prepayment of  was made under the pulitzer notes from excess cash flow of pulitzer 
there was no excess cash flow in the pulitzer notes contain certain covenants and conditions including the maintenance  by pulitzer  of the maximum ratio of debt to ebitda limit of at september   as defined in the guaranty agreement  minimum net worth and limitations on the incurrence of other debt 
the notes amendment added a requirement to maintain minimum interest coverage limit of at september   as defined 
the notes amendment amended the pulitzer notes and the gua ranty agreement covenants to take into account economic conditions and the changes to amortization of debt noted above 
at september   pulitzer was in compliance with such covenants 
further  the notes amendment added and amended other covenants including limitations or restrictions on additional debt  distributions  loans  advances  investments  acquisitions  dispositions and mergers 
such covenants require that substantially all future cash flows of pulitzer are required to be directed first toward repayment of the pulitzer notes and that cash flows of pulitzer are largely segregated from those of the credit parties 
the credit agreement contains a cross default provision tied to the terms of the pulitzer notes and the pulitzer notes have limited cross default provisions tied to the terms of the credit agreement 
the purchase price allocation of pulitzer resulted in an increase in the value of the pulitzer notes in the amount of  which was recorded as debt in the consolidated balance sheets 
at september   the unaccreted balance totals  this amount is being accreted over the remaining life of the pulitzer notes  until april  as a reduction in interest expense using the interest method 
this accretion will not increase the principal amount due  or reduce the amount of interest to be paid  to the noteholders 
liquidity at s eptember   we had  outstanding under the revolving credit facility  and after consideration of the amendments and letters of credit  have approximately  available for future use 
including cash and restricted cash  our liquidity at september  totals  this liquidity amount excludes any future cash flows 
mandatory principal payments on debt in total  since february  we have satisfied all interest payments and substantially all principal payments due under our debt facilities with our cash flows 
we expect all interest and principal payments due in will be satisfied by our continuing cash flows  which will allow us to maintain  or increase  the current level of liquidity 
our ability to operate as a going concern is dependent on our ability to remain in compliance with debt covenants and to refinance or amend our debt agreements as they become due  or earlier if available liquidity is consumed 
we are in compliance with our debt covenants at september  there are numerous potential consequences under the credit agreement  and guaranty agreement and note agreement related to the pulitzer notes  if an event of default occurs and is not remedied 
many of those consequences are beyond our control  and the control of pulitzer and pd llc  respectively 
the occurrence of one or more events of default would give rise to the right of the lenders or the noteholders  or both of them  to exercise their remedies under the credit agreement and the note and guaranty agreements  respectively  including  without limitation  the right to accelerate all outstanding debt and take actions authorized in such circumstances under applicable collateral security doc uments 
the redemption  as discussed more fully in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein  eliminated the potential requirement for a substantial cash outflow in april this event also substantially enhanced our liquidity 
in  we filed a form s shelf registration statement shelf with the sec  which has been declared effective 

table of contents the shelf gives us the flexibility to issue and publicly distribute various types of securities  including preferred stock  common stock  secured or unsecured debt securities  purchase contracts and units consisting of any combination of such securities  from time to time  in one or more offerings  up to an aggregate amount of  the shelf enables us to sell securities quickly and efficiently when market conditions are favorable or financing needs arise 
net proceeds from the sale of any securities must be used generally to reduce debt su bject to conditions of existing debt agreements 
other in  we paid fees to the lenders and noteholders for the amendments and notes amendment which  along with the related legal and financial advisory expenses  totaled   of the fees were capitalized and are being expensed over the remaining term of the credit a greement and pulitzer notes  until april at september   we have total unamortized financing costs of at september   our weighted average cost of debt was

quarterly results of operations are summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein 
inflation price increases or decreases for our products are implemented when deemed appropriate by us 
we continuously evaluate price increases  productivity improvements  sourcing efficiencies and other cost reductions to mitigate the impact of inflation 
changes in laws and regulations energy costs have become more volatile  and may increase in the future as a result of carbon emissions legislation currently under consideration in the united states congress or under regulations being developed by the united states environmental protection agency 
the patient protection and affordable care act  along with its companion reconciliation legislation together the affordable care act were enacted into law in march as a result  in march  we wrote off  of deferred income tax assets due to the loss of future tax deductions for providing retiree prescription drug benefits 
we expect the affordable care act will be supported by a substantial number of underlying regulations  many of which have not been issued 
accordingly  a complete determination of the impact of the affordable care act cannot be made at this time 
however  we expect our future health care costs to increase more rapidly based on analysis published by the united states department of health and human services  input from independent advisors and our understanding of various provisions of the affordable care act that differ from our current medical plans  such as higher maximum age for dependent coverage  elimination of lifetime benefit caps  and  free choice vouchers for certain lower income employees 
administrative costs are also likely to increase as a result of new compliance reporting 
new costs being imposed on other medical care businesses  such as health insurers  pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers  may be passed on to us in the form of higher costs 
we may be able to mitigate certain of these future cost increases 
table of contents through changes in plan design

item a 
quantitative an d qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  exposure to certain of these market risks is managed as described below 
interest rates restricted cash and investments interest rate risk in our restricted cash and investments is managed by investing only in short term securities 
only us government and related securities are permitted 
debt our debt structure and interest rate risk are managed through the use of fixed and floating rate debt 
our primary exposure is to libor 
a basis point increase or decrease to libor would  if in excess of libor minimums discussed more fully below  decrease or increase respectively  income from continuing operations before income taxes 
table of contents on an annualized basis by approximately  based on  of floating rate debt outstanding at september  our debt under the credit agreement is subject to minimum interest rate levels of  and for borrowings for one month  three month and six month periods  respectively 
at september   all of our outstanding debt under the credit agreement is based on one month borrowing 
based on the difference between interest rates at the end of november and our minimum rate for one month borrowing  day libor would need to increase approximately basis points before our borrowing cost would begin to be impacted by an increase in interest rates 
since november   the full amount of the outstanding balance under the credit agreement has been subject to floating interest rates  as all interest rate swaps and collars expired or were terminated at or prior to that date 
at september   approximately of the principal amount of our debt is subject to floating interest rates 
we regularly evaluate alternatives to hedge the related interest rate risk 
certain of our interest earning assets  including those in employee benefit plans  also function as a natural hedge against fluctuations in interest rates on debt 
commodities certain materials used by us are exposed to commodity price changes 
we manage this risk through instruments such as purchase orders and non cancelable supply contracts 
we participate in a buying cooperative with other publishing companies  primarily for the acquisition of newsprint 
we are also involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through identification of sourcing and operating efficiencies 
primary commodity price exposures are newsprint and  to a lesser extent  ink and energy costs 
north american newsprint producers have taken significant steps since october to balance newsprint production capacity against declining north american demand by permanently reducing manufacturing capacity and significantly increasing export shipments to markets outside north america 
throughout  export tonnes  in particular  have been utilized to solidify newsprint order backlogs  thereby supporting domestic  north american newsprint price levels and increases 
north american producers have implemented several price increases beginning in october  resulting in increased purchase costs 
as a result  we expect newsprint costs to be higher than the final extent of future price change announcements  if any  is subject to negotiations with each newsprint producer 
north america s two largest newsprint producers  abitibibowater incorporated and white birch paper holding company  are operating under u 
s and canadian financial reorganization protection 
abitibibowater filed for protection in april and is expected to exit reorganization in december white birch paper holding company filed for protection in february and is negotiating its exit plan 
a per tonne price increase for pound newsprint would result in an annualized reduction in income before income taxes of approximately  based on anticipated consumption in  excluding consumption of t ni and mni and the impact of lifo accounting 
such prices may also decrease 
we manage significant newsprint inventories  which may help to mitigate the impact of future price increases 
sensitivity to changes in value our fixed rate debt consists of the pulitzer notes  which are not traded on an active market and held by a small group of noteholders 
coupled with the volatility of substantially all domestic credit markets that exists we are unable  as of september   to measure the maximum potential impact on fair value of our fixed rate debt from adverse changes in market interest rates under normal market conditions 
the change in value  if determined  could be significant
