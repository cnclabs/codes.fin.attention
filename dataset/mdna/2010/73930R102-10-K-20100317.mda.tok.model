the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the risk factors as well as our financial statements and the related notes 
introduction we are a worldwide organization and leading designer and manufacturer of hundreds of high quality brand name ac dc and dc dc power supplies  converters  inverters and power management products 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers  distributors and service providers who value quality  reliability  technology and service 
we have hundreds of customers in the renewable energy  networking equipment  communications  server storage  computer  instrumentation  industrial  and other electronic equipment industries 
our inverters for renewable energy provide conversion from either wind generators or photovoltaic energy into useable ac power for the grid 
our ac dc power supplies are typically embedded in our customers products and convert alternating current to direct current 
our board mounted dc dc products provide precise levels of dc power to sensitive electronic components embedded in our customers equipment 
our power management products also provide precise levels of dc power to sensitive electronic components  but include elements of communications and control 
in addition  our power management products are programmable via a graphical user interface and offer our customers significant cost and time savings over traditional dc dc converters 
our dc power systems  which provide back up power  are sold primarily to telecommunications and internet service providers worldwide 
we have implemented detailed plans to improve our operational and financial performance  drive long term growth and profitability  improve on time delivery  reduce manufacturing inefficiencies  and increase gross margin 
the operating framework in which we manage our business and guide our strategies is based on the disciplined management of three business levers targeted growth  operational efficiency and capital strategy 
although we have made progress towards our goals in recent periods  
table of contents there are many areas in which we believe that we can still improve 
based on these plans we have recently launched the following initiatives we are investing in additional engineering and design resources to broaden our renewable energy product lines and support customers in key geographical regions as well as to expand our sales channels and increase brand awareness for our renewable energy products 
during  we restructured the marketing teams in order to more aggressively and efficiently generate leads and pursue business opportunities 
we are reviewing product roadmaps and determining how to better deploy our sales resources to drive the business 
during the second half of fiscal  our renewable energy sales showed marked improvement as a result of our ability to leverage market opportunities and increase penetration into key accounts which resulted in increased revenue and order backlog 
we are also designing products based on customer requirements for more efficient power solutions by developing high efficiency products for the storage  server  and networking markets and telecommunications in emerging markets 
in an effort to open the digital power control market for future growth  we are in licensing discussions with both power semiconductor and modular power companies and have licensed our digital power technology patents to companies like linear technology corporation  infineon technologies ag  cui inc  powervation ltd  texas instruments  ericsson modules and lineage power corporation 
in response to demand uncertainty associated with the global economic slowdown and our initiative to improve operational efficiencies by reducing our manufacturing footprint  we implemented our restructuring plan to reduce our global headcount and to exit our dominican republic facility during we anticipate that the closure of the dominican republic facility will be completed by the end of the first half of through implementation of this action  we expect to i realign global manufacturing and sourcing  ii improve operational performance  iii increase efficiencies in the supply chain and manufacturing process and iv improve our ability to respond to customer requirements in a cost effective manner 
as a result  we reduced our global headcount during by approximately  and we estimate that we will achieve annual savings of to million from the global restructuring and facility closure once complete 
during  we continued to improve our factory utilization and on time delivery by improving demand planning  factory throughput  master scheduling  and creating a more robust supply chain 
we are significantly increasing our presence in asia to take advantage of a lower cost structure and closer proximity to suppliers and certain major customers 
we are addressing supply chain issues  including programs to lower material and logistics costs through consolidation of suppliers  the acceleration of the transfer of manufacturing to asia  and the implementation of new sales and operations planning processes 
critical accounting policies application of our accounting policies requires management to make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments  although differing amounts may be reported if there are changes in the assumptions and estimates 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  restructuring costs  goodwill impairment  impairment costs  depreciation and amortization  sales returns and discounts  warranty costs  uncertain tax positions and the recoverability of deferred tax assets  stock compensation  
table of contents business combinations and contingencies 
management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to an understanding of our financial statements and as areas most dependent on management s judgment and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title transfer has occurred  the price is fixed or readily determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue in accordance with asc  revenue recognition 
sales are recorded net of sales returns and discounts  which are estimated at the time of shipment based upon historical data 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment or at the time of inventory consumption for customers on vendor managed inventory vmi programs because this is the point at which revenue is earned and realizable and the earnings process is complete 
for most shipments  title to shipped goods transfers at the shipping point  so the risks and rewards of ownership transfer once the product leaves our warehouse 
for shipments in which title transfers at a later date  revenue recognition is delayed 
revenue is only recognized when collectability is reasonably assured 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
we may charge shipping and handling costs to customers  which are included in revenue 
we offer our distributors a standard agreement which includes payment terms  description of rights to return or exchange product  and price discounts 
under our standard agreement  payment is due within days of shipment of the product to the distributors 
the distributor has a right to return only if we discontinue a product that the distributor has on hand 
the distributor has a right to exchange up to of the dollar value of products purchased within the prior six month period  so long as the distributor is currently purchasing at least the equivalent dollar value in new product 
estimated product exchanges or returns are accrued for at the time of the sale based on historical information in accordance with asc revenue recognition products 
finally  we may give price discounts to a distributor at the time a purchase order is received from the distributor for product that they will sell to a specific customer 
the price discount is available for one year following issuance of the purchase order for items listed on the purchase order 
we accrue for the estimated price discount at the time revenue is recognized 
we have a joint venture in asia which  along with certain of our contract manufacturers  may purchase raw components and other goods from power one  and sell finished goods back to power one as well as to other third parties 
we record revenue on sales to the joint venture and contract manufacturers only when the components and goods are for sales to third parties 
when the joint venture or contract manufacturers purchase components that will be assembled and sold back to us  no revenue is recorded because the earnings process has not been completed 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we review the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets using the methodology prescribed in asc property  plant  and equipment 
management evaluates the company as a single reporting unit for business and operating purposes as many of the company s revenue streams are generated by technology related to more than a single long lived asset  and individual long lived assets support more than one of our revenue categories 
in addition  the majority of our costs are  by their nature  shared costs that are not specifically identifiable with a particular long lived asset or product line but relate to multiple products 
as a result  there is a high degree of interdependency among our cash flows for levels below the consolidated entity and identifiable cash flows for an asset group separate from the consolidated entity are not meaningful 
therefore  the company s impairment test considered the consolidated entity as a single asset group 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
upon such an occurrence  recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows to which the assets relate  to the carrying amount 
if the asset is determined to be unable to recover its carrying 
table of contents value  it is written down to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  appraised values or other information available in the market  depending on the nature of the assets 
methodologies for determining fair value are inherently based on estimates that may change  such as the useful lives of assets and our cash flow forecasts associated with certain assets 
a change in these estimates may result in impairment charges  which would impact our operating results 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets using the methodology prescribed in asc intangibles goodwill and other 
asc requires that we not amortize goodwill  but instead subject it to impairment tests on at least an annual basis and whenever circumstances suggest that they may be impaired 
these impairment tests are also dependent on management s forecasts  which frequently change 
a change in our forecasts may result in impairment charges 
asc requires the company to perform a two step impairment test 
under the first step of the goodwill impairment test  we are required to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and we do not perform the second step 
if the results of the first step impairment test indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit does not exceed its carrying amount  then the second step of the goodwill impairment test is required 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the impairment loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
we determined that we have one reporting unit under asc we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the end of each august fiscal month 
as a result of the continued decrease in our market capitalization during the first fiscal quarter of  we tested our goodwill for impairment and determined that goodwill was impaired 
as our carrying value exceeded our estimated fair value as of march   we applied the approach prescribed in asc for determining the impairment amount 
as a result of the interim test  a goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended january  restructuring charges we record restructuring charges in accordance with asc exit or disposal cost obligations and asc compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits  as applicable 
asc requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  in contrast to the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
in accordance with the guidance provided under asc  we accrue for severance expenses prior to notification for termination benefits that are contractual or required by regional labor laws or are pursuant to a substantive plan where the costs are deemed probable and reasonably estimable 
restructuring costs were related to the downsizing of operations and primarily consisted of specific charges that had been incurred or were to be incurred with no future economic benefit 
these charges included costs related to personnel severance  continuing lease obligations for vacant facilities  and certain contract termination penalties and other shutdown costs 
calculation of the restructuring reserves includes management s judgment regarding closed facilities  which include assumptions about the length of time it will take for facilities to be subleased as well as the likely sublease income amount 
changes in these estimates may impact our operating results 
income taxes we record a deferred income tax asset in jurisdictions where the company generates a loss 
we also record a valuation allowance against these deferred income tax assets in accordance with asc  income taxes  when  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
we record uncertain tax positions under the provisions of asc we recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the positions 
under these provisions  we must assume that the taxing authority will examine the income tax position and will have full knowledge of all relevant information 
for each income tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  we then assess 
table of contents the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
unrecognized tax positions  if ever recognized in the financial statements  are recorded in the statement of operations as part of the income tax provision 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
slow moving and obsolete inventory are written down quarterly based on a comparison of on hand quantities to historical and projected usages 
additionally  reserves for non cancelable open purchase orders for components we are obligated to purchase in excess of projected usage  or for open purchase orders where the market price is lower than the purchase order price  are recorded as other accrued expenses on the balance sheet 
calculation of inventory write downs is based on management s assumptions regarding projected usage of each component  which are subject to changes in market demand 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we establish the allowance for doubtful accounts using the specific identification method and also provide a reserve in the aggregate 
our estimates for calculating the aggregate reserve are based on historical information 
any changes to our assumptions or estimates may impact our operating results 
business combinations we account for our acquisitions utilizing the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method of accounting  the total consideration paid is allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities  identifiable intangible assets in particular  is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to estimates of revenue growth rates  estimates of rates of return  royalty rates  and determination of appropriate discount rates 
these assumptions are generally made based on available historical information 
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives 
recent pronouncements and accounting changes in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb accounting standards codification  asc  generally accepted accounting principles  which establishes the fasb accounting standards codification as the sole source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap 
pursuant to the provisions of asc  we have updated references to gaap in our financial statements issued for the year ended january  the adoption of asc did not impact our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb amended its guidance on accounting for variable interest entities vie 
among other things  the new guidance requires a qualitative rather than a quantitative analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of a vie  requires continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  enhances disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with a vie  and amends certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a vie 
under the new guidance  a vie must be consolidated if the enterprise has both a the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and b the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the requirements of the amended accounting guidance are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after november  and early adoption is prohibited 
the adoption of this new guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  asu 
this update provides amendments to the criteria of asc  revenue recognition  for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
the amendments to 
table of contents this update establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
this accounting standards update will be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier application permitted 
alternatively  an entity can elect to adopt this standard on a retrospective basis 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact this standard may have on our financial position and results of operations upon adoption 
in january  the fasb issued asu  an update that improves the requirements related to fair value measurements and disclosures subtopic of the fasb accounting standards codification originally issued as fasb statement this update requires disclosures about transfers between level  level and level assets and the disaggregated activity in the roll forward for level fair value measurements 
these new disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on august   the sec announced that it will issue for comment a proposed roadmap regarding the potential use by us issuers of financial statements prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs 
ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board 
under the proposed roadmap  the company could be required in fiscal to prepare financial statements in accordance with ifrs  and the sec will make a determination in regarding the mandatory adoption of ifrs 
we have not yet assessed the impact that this potential change would have on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations the year ended january  represents a week year 
the years ended december  and december  represent week years 
the following table represents our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods presented fiscal year ended january  december  december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative engineering and quality assurance amortization of intangibles restructuring costs goodwill impairment asset impairment loss from operations interest income interest expense other income expense  net loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes loss before equity in earnings of joint venture equity in earnings of joint venture  net of tax net loss preferred stock dividend and accretion net loss attributable to common stockholders comparison of fiscal year ended january  with fiscal year ended december  the company s results for the year ended january  were impacted by the global economic recession 
demand across most of our product lines during the year decreased as many of our customers pushed orders out to future quarters and delayed new projects in response to the economic slowdown 
despite these negative impacts  we have reduced our overall cost structure and have made improvement in our gross margin as a result of the implementation of our operational initiatives 
in addition  as a result of our efforts to drive profitability and increase gross margin  we have rationalized our product offering and have eliminated lower margin products and products that do not fit in to our product portfolio 
while overall revenue decreased during fiscal as compared with levels of  revenue generated from renewable energy market sales during the second half of the year significantly increased as compared with the same periods in as well as compared to the first half of fiscal the revenue growth in the renewable energy market was driven primarily by higher demand in the overall solar market  as well as by our continued focus on geographic expansion further into europe and into asia 
in addition to increased order backlog  we have also increased our market share and outpaced the overall market growth in the renewable energy sector 

table of contents net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in sales primarily related to the overall decline in demand across the power conversion market sectors resulting from the global economic conditions 
in addition  the decrease in sales related to product paring in order to better align our strategy and increase focus on selected markets 
the decline in sales across the power conversion markets was partially offset by an increase in sales to the renewable energy market during the year ended january  as compared with  as we increased our presence and market share in both europe and asia 
as a result of the us dollar strengthening on average over functional currencies at our international locations  primarily the euro  our consolidated revenue levels decreased by approximately million during the year ended january  as compared with a substantial portion of our european revenue is transacted in foreign currencies such as the euro and the british pound 
as these currencies weakened on average against the us dollar in  our consolidated net sales were unfavorably impacted for the year ended january  net sales by customer category were as follows  in millions year ended january  year ended december  oems distributors service providers total no customer accounted for more than of our sales during the years ended january  and december  we have defined our end markets based on the customers we serve  and have reclassified certain customers 
our other end market category includes the smart motor control market 
net sales for the years ended january  and december  by end markets under this new classification were as follows year ended january  december  renewable energy network telecom equipment computer and office equipment industrial equipment other total our combined year end day and day backlog were as follows  in millions year ended january  year ended december  combined day backlog combined day backlog the increase in day and day backlog at january  was due to strengthened demand during the year ended january  in the power conversion and renewable energy markets with significant growth in the renewable energy sector 
bookings increased to million  or  during the year ended january  from million booked during year over year bookings 
table of contents increased despite weakened bookings levels during the first half of fiscal as customer demand decreased in response to the global economic recession  and customers consumed their current inventory levels and delayed orders and projects to future periods 
the market showed signs of improvement as orders progressively increased during the second half of fiscal we generally sell our products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long term contracts 
day backlog consists of purchase orders on hand having delivery dates scheduled within the next six months 
our backlog may not necessarily be a reliable indicator of future revenue because our customers are able to cancel or modify their orders up to days prior to delivery up to days prior to delivery without penalty 
in addition  a significant portion of our revenues is derived from turns business that is  revenues from orders that are booked and shipped within the same reporting period 
since a portion of our business is engaged in the design  manufacture and sale of ac dc products that are customized to the particular customer  lead times can be longer and orders may be booked earlier than they would be for our standard products 
our bookings were not significantly impacted by any new vendor managed inventory vmi programs during the year ended january  under a vmi program  we manufacture products for our customers based on their forecast 
as a result  the booking and billing occur simultaneously upon use of the product  and therefore there is always a book to bill ratio of for these programs 
we may bring additional vmi programs on line in the future  which would result in higher turns business  lower backlog  and higher finished goods inventory 
gross profit 
year ended january  december  gross profit  in millions gross profit margin gross profit for the year ended january  was million compared with a gross profit of million for the year ended december  our gross margin increased to for the year ended january  from a gross margin of for the same period in gross margin during the year ended january  was impacted by multiple factors 
positive impacts resulting from the successful implementation of several of our operational initiatives resulted in improved on time delivery to our customers  reduced materials and logistics costs  and the reduction of the overall expense levels 
as a result of these improvements  gross margin for the year ended january  was favorably impacted by approximately margin points and was favorably impacted by approximately margin point resulting from favorable product mix as compared with the prior year 
the decrease in customer demand resulting in a reduction in sales volume of approximately  as well as unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts primarily due to the weakening of the euro against the us dollar between periods  negatively impacted the gross margin by approximately margin points 
increased inventory write downs during the year ended january  as compared with the prior year negatively impacted the gross margin by approximately margin points 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense decreased to for the year ended january  from for the same period in 
table of contents selling expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended december  selling expense decreased primarily as a result of the reduced revenue levels during and the related reductions in sales bonuses and commissions 
selling expense also decreased related to foreign currency fluctuations as the functional currencies at certain of our foreign locations weakened against the us dollar during as compared with in addition  selling expense decreased during as compared to as a result of our continued efforts to reduce the company s cost structure 
administrative expense decreased million  or to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily a result of continued efforts to reduce the company s cost structure as well as a result of the us dollar strengthening against the functional currencies at our foreign locations during engineering and quality assurance 
engineering and quality assurance expense decreased million  or to million for the year ended january  from million for year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  engineering and quality assurance expense decreased to for the year ended january  from for the same period in the decreases in engineering and quality assurance expense were primarily due to continued efforts to reduce the company s cost structure through spending reductions  relocation of engineering resources to lower cost locations  and efficiency improvements 
engineering and quality assurance expense also decreased as a result of foreign currency fluctuations for the year ended january  compared with amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangible assets decreased by million to million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to certain intangibles reaching the end of their amortizable life 
restructuring costs and asset impairment 
during the year ended january   we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million  in accordance with asc exit or disposal cost obligations and asc compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits  as applicable 
during  we announced and implemented a plan to restructure our global organization in response to ongoing demand uncertainty and to exit our factory in the dominican republic 
the plan is expected to be completed by the end of the first half of through implementation of this action  we intend to i realign global manufacturing and sourcing  ii improve operational performance  iii increase efficiencies in the supply chain and manufacturing process and iv improve our ability to respond to customer requirements in a cost effective manner 
with respect to the restructuring plan  we recorded approximately million of severance and other charges during and we expect to record an additional to million of severance and other charges during we anticipate that the portion of the charge that will result in future cash expenditures will be approximately million for severance for terminated employees and approximately million for other costs associated with the facility closure 
we estimate that we will achieve annual savings of to million from the closure of the dominican republic and an additional to million from our global restructuring efforts 
during the year ended january   we recorded severance benefits of approximately million 
we also recorded approximately million of facility closure costs related to continuing lease obligations during the year ended january  in connection with the facility closure  we also recorded million of inventory charges and million of accelerated depreciation to cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended january  no restructuring or asset impairment charges were recorded during the year ended december  
table of contents goodwill impairment 
in accordance with asc intangibles goodwill and other  we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually at the end of each fiscal august 
as a result of the continued decrease in our market capitalization during the first fiscal quarter of  we tested our goodwill for impairment and determined that goodwill was impaired 
our testing approach utilized a discounted cash flow analysis and comparative market multiples to determine our single reporting unit fair value for comparison to our carrying value 
as our carrying value exceeded our estimated fair value as of march   we applied the approach prescribed in asc for determining the impairment amount 
as a result of the interim test  a goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended january  loss from operations 
as a result of the items above  loss from operations increased million to a loss of million for the year ended january  from an operating loss of million for the same period in interest income expense  net 
net interest expense was million for the year ended january  compared to net interest expense of million for the same period in the net interest expense recorded during the year ended january  related to interest on an average balance of approximately million of senior secured convertible notes carrying an effective interest rate of approximately  as well as interest on approximately million of senior convertible notes issued may  at an effective interest rate of  and interest related to credit facilities and long term debt obligations at certain foreign locations 
the net interest expense recorded during the year ended december  related to interest on million in term debt  carrying an effective interest rate of approximately  and million related to the write off of the debt issue costs and debt discount related to the million pwer bridge term debt which was repaid near the end of the quarter ended june   as well as to interest expense recorded during the second half of fiscal related to million of senior secured convertible notes at an effective interest rate of approximately 
also included in the interest expense for the year ended december  was interest related to credit facilities and long term debt obligations at the certain foreign locations 
gain on extinguishment of debt 
net gain on extinguishment of debt of million for the year ended january  was recorded as a result of the repurchase of million of outstanding senior secured convertible notes for million during the year ended january  gain on extinguishment of debt of million for the year ended december  was recorded as a result of the repurchase of million of outstanding senior secured convertible notes during the fourth quarter other income expense  net 
net other income was million for the year ended january   compared with net other expense of million for the year ended december  net other income during included million of gain due to changes in the market value of the embedded derivatives related to the securities issued to silver lake sumeru see note 
net other income during also included approximately million related to foreign currency transaction losses 
our primary foreign currencies are the euro  the swiss franc  the british pound  and the chinese rmb 
net other expense during included approximately million expense related to the write off of a loan to a foreign supplier and a million investment in a privately held company  as well as approximately million related to foreign currency transaction losses 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended january  compared to a benefit for income taxes of million for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes recorded during the year ended january  primarily related to taxes recorded at certain of our profitable european locations 
partially offsetting the provision for income taxes recorded during the year ended january  was approximately million related to the reversal of certain reserves for uncertain tax positions due to a closed tax audit 
during the year ended december   we reversed certain reserves for uncertain tax 
table of contents positions of approximately million upon expiration of a tax statute as well as due to a closed tax audit 
although we record deferred income tax assets in jurisdictions where we generate a loss for income tax purposes  we also record a valuation allowance against these deferred income tax assets when  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as a result  we may record no tax benefit in jurisdictions where we incur a loss  but record tax expense in jurisdictions where we record taxable income and have no net operating loss nol carryforward 
equity in earnings of joint venture 
during the years ended january  and december   we recorded approximately million and million  respectively  related to our equity share in the earnings of a joint venture 
the amounts recorded during the year ended december  included approximately million related to our equity share in the earnings of the joint venture and approximately million related to a cash dividend  representing a return on our investment in the joint venture 
during through fiscal  we impaired our equity investment in our joint venture in asia as a result of our analysis of the future discounted cash flows combined with other impairment indicators 
however  during march  we received a cash dividend of million from the joint venture  representing a return on our investment 
preferred stock dividend and accretion 
as a result of the issuance of million of redeemable convertible preferred stock to silver lake sumeru  in  we recorded million related to the preferred stock dividend and million related to the periodic accretions under the interest method 
see part iv 
item note comparison of fiscal year ended december  with fiscal year ended december  the company s results for the year ended december  improved  with sales increasing and loss from operations decreasing from the prior year 
our international operations experienced favorable foreign currency fluctuations which contributed to the results 
in addition  our results improved due to leverage on increased sales volume  benefits from product rationalization actions and business mix 
net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of the strengthening of the functional currencies at our international locations  primarily the euro and swiss franc  our consolidated revenue levels increased by approximately million during the year ended december  as compared with a substantial portion of our european revenue is transacted in foreign currencies such as the euro  the swiss franc  and the british pound 
as these currencies strengthened on average over the us dollar in  our consolidated net sales were favorably impacted for the year ending december  net sales were also favorably impacted by growth in the renewable energy inverter market  offset by decreases in the smart motor control market due to product rationalization efforts instituted by the company  and by decreases across the industrial and computer office equipment markets 
net sales by customer category were as follows  in millions year ended december  year ended december  oems distributors service providers total 
table of contents no customer accounted for more than of our sales during the years ended december  and december  we have redefined our end markets based on the customers we serve  and have reclassified certain customers
