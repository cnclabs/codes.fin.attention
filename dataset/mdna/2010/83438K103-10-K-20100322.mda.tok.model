in june  we received clearance to market our system for treatment of wrinkles and rhytides for the upper and lower eyelids 
in june  we received fda clearance to market our latest thermage system and hand piece configuration for wrinkles  rhytides and for the temporary improvement in the appearance of cellulite 
our patented and fda cleared systems uses radiofrequency  or rf  energy to heat and shrink collagen and tighten tissue while simultaneously cooling and protecting the surface of the skin 
laser devices used for aesthetic procedures  such as skin resurfacing  are also generally regulated as class ii medical devices  requiring k clearance 
the fda has granted eleven k clearances for four fraxel devices relating to multiple indications for use 
we received fda clearance to market our first generation fraxel sr system for coagulation of soft tissue in november and subsequently for treatment of periorbital wrinkles june  pigmented lesions june  melasma march  skin resurfacing procedures july and acne and surgical scars march 
in march  we received fda clearance to market our fraxel re store system for soft tissue coagulation and for treatment of periorbital wrinkles  pigmented lesions  melasma and skin resurfacing 
we subsequently received fda clearance for the fraxel re store for treatment of acne and surgical scars in january and for actinic keratoses in may in april  we received fda clearance to market the fraxel re fine system for soft tissue coagulation and for treatment of periorbital wrinkles  pigmented lesions  melasma  skin resurfacing  acne scars and surgical scars 
the fraxel re pair system was cleared for ablation  coagulation and resurfacing of soft tissue in april and for treatment of wrinkles  pigmentation  textural irregularities and vascular dyschromia in november we received fda clearance for two additional fraxel re pair hand pieces in july  which deliver ablative and incisional treatments for surgical applications 
in october  we received fda clearance to market the fraxel dual system  which consists of nm and nm wavelength lasers 
as of december   we had a global installed base of over  systems 
on february   we acquired of the common stock of aesthera corporation aesthera  a privately held medical device company  for million in shares of our common stock to aesthera senior debt holders and  in cash to such holders  certain security holders and certain obligation holders of aesthera  including advisors and severance recipients 
the shares were valued at per share 
in connection with this transaction  the company entered into a contingent consideration arrangement which requires payments of up to 
table of contents million in shares of our common stock if certain criteria in relation to revenue recognized on the sale of aesthera products and collection of certain aesthera receivables are met during the one year period beginning april  on december   as described below  we acquired reliant technologies  inc reliant  a privately held company  for million in cash  million shares of our common stock and assumption of million of debt  including a million note payable to thermage 
the acquisition resulted in a combined company with two strong brand names and one of the largest direct us sales forces in the industry 
following the acquisition  we changed our name to solta medical  inc net revenue for the year ended december  increased or million  to million  from million in  mainly from the contribution from the sale of products and services previously marketed by reliant under the fraxel brand name 
our business continued to be impacted by the weakness in global economic conditions and tightening of the credit markets  which resulted in a slowdown in customer purchase decisions 
as our procedures are generally elective  the slowing economy reduced demand for our procedures 
the tight credit markets limited the ability of some of our customers to obtain financing for the purchase of our products 
in response to the continuing difficulties in the economy  we have implemented a number of initiatives in response to the tight worldwide credit market  including expanding our partner program to include fraxel consumables as well as offering incentives to doctors who become both fraxel and thermage customers 
acquisition of reliant technologies  inc on december   we acquired of the common stock of reliant for million in cash and million shares of solta medical common stock and assumption of million of debt  including a million note payable to thermage 
this acquisition expands the market presence of the company 
complementary product offerings allow us to cross sell a more complete product line to physicians and their patients through one of the largest direct us sales forces in the industry and an expansive international distribution network 
the acquisition purchase price totaled a combined million cash paid  million for million shares issued at the share price on the date of announcement   fair value of assumed warrants and approximately million in direct transaction costs 
we recorded an estimate for costs to terminate some activities associated with the reliant operations 
the restructuring accrual of approximately million at december  was principally related to the termination of reliant employees of approximately million and restructuring of facilities of million 
the valuation of identified intangible assets acquired was based on management s estimates  currently available information and reasonable and supportable assumptions 
the allocation was based on the fair value of these assets determined using the income approach 
the income approach  using a discounted cash flow model  was used to determine the estimated fair values of the acquired intangible assets 
the company calculated the present value of the expected future cash flows attributable to the acquired intangibles using an to discount rate 
with respect to intangible assets  there are several methods available under the income approach to quantify fair value 
under this approach the company used the following methods to quantify fair value of the acquired intangibles at the acquisition date 
the excess earnings method was used for the following four intangible assets product technology  customer relationships  royalties intangible and product development contract 
the relief from royalties method was used for the core technology and fraxel trade name intangibles with a royalty rate of and  respectively 
the lost profits method also referred to as the with and without method was used for the non compete agreement with a probability of competition rate of 
the company utilized third party market data ie license agreements to derive valuation assumptions used to fair value certain intangible assets  such as the fraxel trade name and core technology 

table of contents of the total original purchase price of approximately million  approximately million was allocated to amortizable intangible assets 
approximately million of the amortizable intangible assets are being amortized using a straight line method over their respective estimated useful lives of two to years 
in conjunction with the acquisition of reliant  we recorded an expense of approximately million for acquired in process research and development ipr d during the quarter and year ended december   because feasibility of the acquired technology had not been established and no alternative future use exists 
the ipr d is related to the development of three new products 
the three significant ipr d projects at date of acquisition were as follows project a a next generation dual wave length fraxel re store system  project b a body shaping product  and project c a resurfacing product for the professional market being developed in a collaborative partnership 
at the date of acquisition  it was estimated that project a would be completed in  project b would be completed in and project c would be completed in project a was completed in september and fda clearance was received in october project b and c are currently in clinical investigations and commercialization is expected in  at which time cash flows are expected to commence 
we used the income approach excess earnings method to determine the estimated fair values of the acquired ipr d  which uses a discounted cash flow model  based on estimates of successful product development and commercialization to estimate future net cash flows resulting from projected revenues and related costs 
these estimates take into account the stages of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the underlying product candidates 
we calculated the present value of the expected future cash flows attributable to the in process technology using a to discount rate for the related projects 
the after tax cash flows are calculated by applying cost  expense  income tax and contributory asset charge assumptions to the ipr d revenue streams 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these ipr d projects include delays caused by legal actions brought by our competitors and the timing of the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals 
no assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will not change or the timely completion of each project to commercial success will occur 
for these and other reasons  actual results may vary significantly from estimated results 
we allocated the residual value of approximately million to goodwill at december   and adjusted this amount to million during the year ended december  for adjustments to the valuation of inventory acquired  accrued restructuring  prepaid expenses  and adjustments of the acquisition consideration for a shortfall in reliant s closing working capital 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment on an annual basis or when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the factors that contributed to a premium on the purchase price that resulted in the recognition of goodwill were the expansion of our recurring revenue model allowing for increased treatment tip usage as well as expanding clinical applications for our physician customers 
access to an expanded base of industry knowledge and expertise 
opportunity to complement our existing products for the aesthetic market with a synergistic technology and new clinical treatment applications 
expansion of our global presence thereby increasing our market penetration 
the company performed a goodwill impairment test at the end of and as a result  no goodwill impairment was identified through december  the test was based on our single operating segment and reporting unit structure 

table of contents significant business trends we derive revenue primarily from the sale of systems  treatment tips and consumables 
for the years ended december   and we derived  and respectively  of our revenue from treatment tips and consumable sales  and  and respectively  of our revenue from system sales 
the balance of our revenue is derived from service  research and development and shipping 
during  we launched four new procedures and associated treatment tips  including the premium stc tip for skin tightening and contouring  and the dc tip for deep contouring and body shaping 
in march  we introduced the cellulite tip 
during  we launched two new systems  the thermage cpt and fraxel re store dual 
with the acquisition of reliant  we have seen sales of treatment tips and consumables decrease as a percentage of solta revenue versus system sales  and revenue derived from sales of products and services within the united states decrease as a percentage of total solta revenue 
during the second quarter of  we announced the termination of the upgrade program for our first generation thermage and fraxel systems to the current versions of these systems 
as a result  we experienced a high volume of system upgrade sales  which contributed to the increase in the proportion of revenue from system sales 
we market our products in the united states to physicians  primarily dermatologists and plastic surgeons  through a direct sales force and internationally in over countries through a network of independent distributors and direct sales force in certain countries 
in the years ended december   and we derived  and  respectively  of our revenue from sales of our products and services within the united states  and  and  respectively  of our total sales outside of the united states 
we believe that a significant portion of our business will continue to come from international sales through increased penetration in countries where we currently sell our products  combined with expansion into new international markets 
the percentages of our revenue by region are presented in the table below years ended december  united states asia pacific europe middle east rest of the world total net revenue we continue to believe our bifurcated sales force will serve us well 
with the acquisition of reliant  we have one of the largest direct us sales forces in the industry  with about half of the sales force focusing on existing customers and sales of treatment tips  upgrades and training  and the remainder focusing on securing new accounts 
future operating results are difficult to predict accurately 
we anticipate that our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including prevailing economic conditions and our customers access to the credit market  the timing of introduction and the degree of acceptance of future product offerings  unanticipated interruptions and expenses related to our manufacturing operations  and the performance of our direct sales force and international distributors 
the tight credit markets limited the ability of some of our customers to obtain financing for the purchase of our products 
in response to the continuing difficulties in the economy  we have implemented a number of initiatives in response to the tight worldwide credit market  including expanding our partner program to include fraxel consumables as well as offering incentives to doctors who become both fraxel and thermage customers 
we introduced two new products during the second half of  the commercial success of which will depend upon the acceptance of these products by physicians and their patients 
as new or enhanced products are introduced  we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories  and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 

table of contents significant industry factors the growth of our business relies on current economic conditions and their impact on the growth of the industry  our ability to continue to develop new products  applications and innovative technologies  obtain and maintain regulatory clearances for our products  protect our proprietary technology  and successfully market and distribute our products 
our industry is characterized by seasonally lower demand during the third calendar quarter of the year  when both physicians and prospective patients take summer vacations 
additionally  our industry is highly competitive and our success depends on our ability to compete successfully 
our business is sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending  including political and economic conditions such as recessionary environments  the level of disposable consumer income  consumer debt  interest rates and consumer confidence 
declines in consumer spending on aesthetic procedures could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors that impact our business is provided in the risk factors section in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those described below 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition product revenue is recognized when title and risk of ownership have been transferred  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  remaining obligations are insignificant and collectability is reasonably assured 
transfer of title and risk of ownership typically occur when the product is shipped to the customer 
revenue is recorded net of customer and distributor discounts 
revenue from the sale of extended service contracts for products beyond their warranty term is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable extended contract 
we also earn service revenue from customers outside of their warranty term or extended service contracts 
such service revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
our system sales in the united states typically have post sale obligations of installation and training 
these obligations are fulfilled after product shipment 
when we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements  we defer revenue attributable to the post shipment obligations and recognize such revenue when the obligation is fulfilled 
otherwise  we will defer all revenue until all elements are delivered 
we sell to end users in the united states and primarily to distributors outside of the united states 
sales to end users and distributors do not include return rights 
we typically recognize revenues upon shipment for sales to our independent third party distributors as we have no continuing obligations subsequent to shipment  other than replacement parts warranty coverage 
the distributors are responsible for all marketing  sales  installation  training and warranty services for our products 
we do not provide price protection or stock rotation rights to any of our distributors 
in addition  our distributor agreements do not allow the distributors to return or exchange products and the distributors are obligated to pay us for the sale regardless of whether the distributors are able to resell the product 
for sales transactions with non standard extended payment terms or when collectability is not reasonably assured  we recognize revenue upon receipt of cash payment 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are typically unsecured and derived from revenues earned from customers 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate appropriate allowances based upon any specific customer collection issues  our history of losses  economic conditions and age of customer balances 
our assessment of the ability of our customers to pay generally includes direct contact with the customer  a review of their financial status  as well as consideration of their payment history with us 
warranty reserve we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we offered a three year warranty for thermage systems sold in the united states  one year for fraxel systems sold worldwide and a one year replacement parts warranty for systems sold to distributors outside of the united states through december  beginning in january   we offered a one year warranty period for systems sold worldwide 
we also provide a warranty for our consumable products 
inventory valuation we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market value  cost being determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis and market value being determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
standard costs are monitored on a monthly basis and updated quarterly and as necessary to reflect changes in raw material costs and labor and overhead rates 
inventory reserves are established when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
inventory reserves are charged to cost of revenue and establish a lower cost basis for the inventory 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the company s goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis or when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step the company compares its fair value to the carrying value including goodwill 
if the carrying value including goodwill exceeds its fair value  the company moves on to step if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
to date  the fair value of the company has exceeded the carrying value and thus no goodwill impairment change has been recorded 
step the company performs an allocation of the fair value to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill and liabilities 
this allows the company to derive an implied fair value of goodwill 
the company then compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment change would be recognized for the excess 

table of contents we test goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that this asset may be impaired 
the goodwill test is based on our single operating segment and reporting unit structure 
no goodwill impairment was identified through december  impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  including property and equipment and finite lived intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
litigation and claims from time to time  we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business 
we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters and claims  as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience 
we do not believe the final disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial statements and future cash flows of the company 
also  we do not record gain contingencies 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits and deductions  such as tax benefits from our non us operations and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we believe we have provided adequate reserves for uncertain tax positions for anticipated audit adjustments by us federal  state and local  as well as foreign tax authorities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes  interest and penalties may be due 
if events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the accrued liabilities are no longer warranted 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
valuation of share based awards share based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of option awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  
table of contents expected forfeitures and expected dividends 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes option pricing model for option grants incorporates our historical volatility and volatility of similar public entities in the aesthetics market due to a lack of historical information regarding the volatility of our stock price 
when establishing the expected term assumption  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
results of operations years ended december  and december  net revenue 
revenue is derived from the sales of systems  treatment tips and other consumables  and service and other revenue 
net revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the contribution from fraxel sales in resulting from the reliant acquisition in december system sales for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the same period in sales of treatment tips and other consumables was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the same period in these increases were due to the contributions from fraxel sales resulting from the reliant acquisition and an increase in thermage system upgrades during  partially offset by a decrease in thermage tip revenue 
cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of material  labor and manufacturing overhead expenses 
gross margin was of revenue for the year ended december   compared with of revenue for the same period in the decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue for the year ended december  was primarily due to a million fair value adjustment to cost of sales resulting from sales of inventory assumed in the reliant acquisition  million of amortization expense from intangible assets from the reliant acquisition  a higher proportion of lower margin system and system upgrade sales than higher margin tip sales primarily resulting from the reliant acquisition  unfavorable overhead absorption due to lower than planned production volume  and downward sales pricing pressure caused by the continuing difficulties in the economy  sales and marketing

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  legal and accounting fees  human resources costs and other general operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  compared with million for the same period in the increase from the prior year period was due to an increase of million in employee payroll and related expenses  and an increase of million in professional fees primarily due to increased outside accounting  tax and legal fees  partially offset by million in merger related expenses incurred in during the first quarter of  we reached an advanced stage of negotiations with a potential acquisition target and had performed significant due diligence on the project before negotiations were terminated 
the million in outside advisory fees incurred in the first quarter of in pursuing this acquisition did not recur in interest and other income 
interest and other income consist primarily of interest income generated from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments

gain loss on investments 
during the year ended december   we realized million in gains on investments that had either been sold or matured in our portfolio during the during  we deemed certain declines in the fair market value of our available for sale marketable securities to be other than temporary and as a result  recorded a million loss in the year ended december  of the million loss recorded during the year  approximately million was related to a single security in our investment portfolio 
provision benefit for income taxes 
there was an income tax provision of  and a tax benefit of  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  primarily represented additions to amt taxes and additions to reserves for uncertain tax positions  while the benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  primarily represented refunds of income taxes  partially offset by additions to reserves for uncertain tax positions 
we did not recognize any tax benefits in relation to the loss before income taxes for the year ended december  as we maintained a full valuation allowance for deferred taxes 
years ended december  and december  effect of acquisition of reliant technologies  inc our results of operations in the year ended december  included the effect of the acquisition of reliant on december  and the results of operations of reliant from december  to december  net revenue 
revenue is derived from the sales of systems  treatment tips and other consumables and service and other revenue 
net revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the same period in the decrease in sales in from was primarily due to a comparative weakening of global economic conditions  and tightening of the credit market that resulted in a slowdown of customer purchasing decisions during the second half of sales of treatment tips and other consumables was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the same period in the decrease in treatment tips and consumables revenue was due primarily to a decrease in units sold  partially offset by an increase in average selling price of tips  driven by sales of premium tips 
sales of premium tips such as the stc tip for skin tightening and contouring  the dc tip for deep contouring and body shaping and the cl tip for cellulite represented approximately of total sales of treatment tips and consumables during the year ended

cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of material  labor and manufacturing overhead expenses 
gross margin was in the year ended december   compared with for the same period in during  gross margins were favorably impacted by higher average selling price of treatment tips and higher sales mix towards the higher margin treatment tip products 
these favorable variances  however  were offset by lower production volumes  provision for obsolete and excess inventories and loss on disposal of service inventories

stock based compensation expense related to stock options granted to non employees is recognized on a straight line basis 
the options generally vest ratably over four years 
the values attributable to these options are amortized over the service period and the unvested portion of these options is remeasured as the services are provided and the options are earned

the term loans are payable in equal monthly payments of principal and interest 
the revolving loan facility and term loans subject the company to certain financial and non financial covenants and the bank has a first security interest in all of the company s assets including intellectual property 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december   except for maintaining the minimum liquidity ratio as required by the loan agreement 
the lender issued us a formal waiver of the liquidity covenant violation 
we repaid all funds drawn from the revolving loan facility in january in connection with the loan and security agreement  the company s subsidiary  reliant technologies  llc reliant llc  entered into an unconditional guaranty  dated as of march  the guaranty  in favor of lender  pursuant to which reliant llc guaranteed all of the obligations of the company under the loan agreement  and a security agreement  dated as of march  the security agreement  with lender  pursuant to which reliant llc granted a security interest in substantially all of its personal property to collateralize its obligations under the guaranty 
our future capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our current and future products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  and continued progress of our research and development of new products 
we expect to increase capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in manufacturing  infrastructure and personnel 
we also may increase our capital expenditures as we expand our product lines or invest to address new markets 
in january  the company entered into securities purchase agreements in connection with a private placement of its securities to certain institutional and other accredited investors pursuant to which the company agreed to sell and issue i an aggregate of  newly issued shares of its common stock  par value per share and ii warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the sale of securities resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds  after deducting offering expenses were approximately million 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances and cash generated from operations  along with the credit facilities made available to us in  will meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
our future liquidity requirements may increase beyond currently expected levels if we fail to maintain compliance with such covenants or if unanticipated expenses or other uses of our cash arise 
in order to meet our future liquidity needs  we may become reliant on additional equity and or debt financing 
such additional financing may not be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us  or at all  particularly in the short term due to the current credit and equity market funding environments 
any future equity financing would result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
the availability of financing or merger opportunities will depend  in part  on market conditions  and the outlook for our company

this update provides application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated to one or more units of accounting 
this update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable

more specifically  this update will require a an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers  and b information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements to be presented separately ie present the activity on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level inputs

the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosure are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   except for the disclosure requirements for related to the purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the rollforward activity of level fair value measurements 
those disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk currently  most of our sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars  although  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products 
we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates will impact our interest sensitive credit agreement and accordingly may impact interest expense 
we have determined that if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by basis points  there would be no material impact to interest expense over a year period
