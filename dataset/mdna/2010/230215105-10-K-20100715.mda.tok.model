our operations are classified into two business segments mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics 
the mattress fabrics segment manufactures  sources  and sells fabrics to bedding manufacturers 
the upholstery fabrics segment sources  manufacturers and sells fabrics primarily to residential and commercial contract furniture manufacturers 
we evaluate the operating performance of our segments based upon income loss from operations before restructuring and related charges credits  certain unallocated corporate expenses  and other non recurring items 
cost of sales in both segments include costs to manufacture or source our products  including costs such as raw material and finished goods purchases  direct and indirect labor  overhead and incoming freight charges 
unallocated corporate expenses primarily represent compensation and benefits for certain executive officers and all costs related to being a public company 
segment assets include assets used in the operation of each segment and primarily consist of accounts receivable  inventories  and property  plant and equipment 
the mattress fabrics segment also includes in segment assets  assets he ld for sale  goodwill  and non compete agreements associated with certain acquisitions 
the upholstery fabrics segment also includes assets held for sale in segment assets

of the million restructuring and related charges  million and million represented non cash and cash charges  respectively 
we reported net income of million in fiscal  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss of million in fiscal  or per diluted share 
the net loss for fiscal included a million non cash charge  or per diluted share  for the establishment of a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets  and million  or per diluted share  in restructuring and related charges noted above 
the mattress fabric segment reported net sales of million in fiscal compared with million for fiscal although mattress fabric sales remained flat for fiscal  mattress fabric net sales increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal this increase in the fourth quarter reflects significant improvement in consumer demand in the bedding industry and the closure of a key competitor in late calendar segment operating income was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal operating margins improved to in fiscal compared with in fiscal the increase in operating income and margins is primarily due to favorable raw material pricing stemming from our global sourcing efforts  a sales shift to higher margin pro ducts  and the efficiency gains made possible from our capital investment programs 
the upholstery fabric segment reported net sales of million in fiscal  an increase of  compared with million for fiscal this increase represents the first annual sales gain for the upholstery fabric segment in ten fiscal years 
in addition  upholstery fabric net sales increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal operating income for fiscal was million compared with an operating loss of million for fiscal  representing a million turnaround 
this substantial improvement in operating income was primarily due to a multi year restructuring process that established a leaner and more agile manufacturing platform  including a wholly owned business located in china that is scalable  but not capital intensive 
throughout fiscal  we strengthened our financial position and generated significant cash flow despite an unfavorable economic environment 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at may   compared with million at may  in fiscal  cash flow from operations was million  which primarily represents cash flow from earnings totaling million 
during fiscal  we generated substantially less cash flow from working capital reductions and more from operating income  as profit margins significantly improved

nm not meaningful compared with segment analysis mattress fabrics segment net sales for fiscal  the mattress fabrics segment reported net sales of million compared with million for fiscal in contrast to the small year over year decline  mattress fabric net sales increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal this increase in the fourth quarter reflects significant improvement in consumer demand in the bedding industry in early calendar and the closure of a key competitor in late calendar gross profit and operating income the mattress fabrics segment reported gross profit of million in fiscal compared with million for fiscal the mattress fabrics segment reported operating income of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal despite net sales remaining relatively the same in fiscal compared with  gross profit margins increased to in fiscal compared with in fiscal also  operating income margins increased to in fiscal compared with in fiscal our improved performance in our mattress fabric segment reflects the benefits of the ongoing investments we have made to develop an efficient and scalable manufacturing platform 
these investments include the bodet horst acquisition made in august in addition  we also benefited from other operational initiatives 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the installation of state of the art finishing equipment for our growing knit fabric business 
this initiative represents the final step in our strategy to become fully vertical in our manufacturing platform for the knit fabrics product category and will complement our fully vertical manufacturing platform for woven fabrics 
benefits from this initiative include faster response time  quality enhancements  fabric innovation opportunities  and lower costs 
w e are also in the process of further expanding our capacity for both knit and woven product lines  as well as completing an energy initiative in our canadian operation that will have an environmental benefit and reduce future operating costs 
capital expenditures for our mattress fabric business totaled million in fiscal  reflecting our continued commitment to the bedding industry 
we plan to continue our significant level of capital spending in fiscal in order to modernize and expand our woven and knit capacities 
our improved operating performance in fiscal also reflects lower raw material prices obtained from our global sourcing strategy 
although we are pleased with our performance in fiscal  we are currently facing significant pricing pressures and higher raw material costs 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal segment assets segment assets consist of accounts receivable  inventory  assets held for sale  non compete agreements associated with certain acquisitions  goodwill  and property  plant and equipment 
as of may   accounts receivable and inventory totaled million  compared to million at may  this change reflects the net sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal noted above 
at may   and may   this segment had assets held for sale with carrying values totaling  and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  equipment with a carrying value of  was classified as held for sale 
we determined that the carrying value of this equipment exceeded its fair value based on quoted market prices 
consequently  we recorded an impairment loss of  in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
the remaining carrying value of  is expected to be sold in fiscal this segment reported equipment with a carrying value of  as held for sale at may  this equipment was sold for  during fiscal at may   and may   the carrying value of our non compete agreements were  and million  respectively 
at may   and may  the carrying value of the segment s goodwill was million and million  respectively 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we finalized our valuation of the fair values for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the bodet horst acquisition 
as a result of this final valuation  we recorded an adjustment to increase the fair value of the associated non compete agreement and reduce the fair value of goodwill by  at may   and may   property  plant and equipment totaled million and million  respectively 
the million represents property  plant  and equipment located in the us of million and located in canada of million 
the million balance at may   represents property  plant  and equipment located in the us of million and located in canada of million 
the increase in this segment s property  plant  and equipment balance at may   compared with may   is primarily due to fiscal capital spending of million  offset by depreciation expense of million 
upholstery fabrics segment net sales upholstery fabric net sales which include both fabric and cut and sewn kits were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal  an increase of 
this increase represents the first annual sales gain for the upholstery fabric segment in ten fiscal years 
in addition  upholstery fabric net sales increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal as noted below  the increase in net sales reflects our focus this fiscal year on product development  sales and marketing initiatives  delivery performance  and aggressively defending our copyrights 
in addition  fiscal net sales were affected by the planned discontinuation of certain us products as part of our profit improvement plan implemented in fiscal  and a significant increase in the provision for returns  allowances  and discounts 
net sales of upholstery fabrics produced outside our us manufacturing operations were million in fiscal  an increase of from million in fiscal net sales produced outside our us manufacturing operations represented of total upholstery fabric net sales in fiscal compared with in fiscal net sales of us produced upholstery fabrics were million in fiscal  a decrease of from million in fiscal this continued shift toward production outside our us manufacturing operations is the result of our long term strategy to build a wholly owned and low cost business located in china that is scalable  and not capital intensive 
gross profit and operating income loss the upholstery fabrics segment reported gross profit of million in fiscal compared with million for fiscal this significant improvement in gross profit led to operating income of million in fiscal compared with an operating loss of million in fiscal  representing a million turnaround 
the substantial improvement in the upholstery fabric segment s gross profit and operating income reflects the increase in net sales noted above and the incremental benefits of our restructuring activities and the profit improvement plan completed in fiscal see vs 
comparison for details of the profit improvement plan 
we are realizing the benefits of our long term strategy to build a wholly owned and low cost business located in china that is scalable  but not capital intensive 
additionally  we are beginning to benefit from a complimentary strategy to grow business in our one remaining us upholstery facility  based upon a model of utilizing china sourced yarns  low overhead and a focused  volume oriented product strategy 
also  the favorable results of our restructuring activities and profit improvement plan a llowed us to shift our focus in fiscal to product development  sales and marketing initiatives  and delivery performance 
lastly  we began efforts to aggressively defending our design copyrights and have taken action to protect our creativity  and we believe these efforts are helping us retain and grow sales of certain upholstery fabrics 
although we are pleased with our performance in fiscal  we are currently facing significant pricing pressures and higher raw material costs 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal segment assets segment assets consist of accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and assets held for sale 
as of may   accounts receivable and inventory totaled million  compared to million at may  this change reflects the net sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal noted above 
at may   the upholstery fabrics segment had property  plant  and equipment totaling  this  represents property  plant  and equipment located in the us and china of  and  respectively 
during the second quarter of fiscal  assets with a carrying value of  were reclassified from held for sale see below paragraph 
as of may   the upholstery fabrics segment reported no carrying value associated with its property  plant  and equipment due to impairment charges incurred in fiscal see restructuring section below and the classification of property  plant  and equipment as assets held for sale 
at may  and may   this segment had assets held for sale with a carrying value of  and million  respectively 
due to the favorable results from our profit improvement plan and restructuring activities initiated in the second quarter of fiscal  management assessed the classification of upholstery fabric assets classified as held for sale during the second quarter of fiscal as a result of this assessment  upholstery fabric assets with a carrying value of  were reclassified from assets held for sale to held and used included in property  plant  and equipment on the may  consolidated balance sheet 
this carrying value of  represents these assets carrying amount before being classified as held for sale the third quarter of fiscal adjusted for depreciation expense tha t would have been recognized had these assets been classified as held and used  which is lower than these assets fair value at the date they were reclassified to held and used during the second quarter of fiscal 
consequently we recorded a charge totaling  in the second quarter of fiscal to depreciation expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
we expect the remaining carrying amount of  to be sold by the end of fiscal we determined that the carrying value of  did not exceed its fair value 
as a result  an impairment charge was not recorded in fiscal during fiscal  we received sales proceeds of  on assets classified as held for sale 
restructuring and related charges credits during fiscal  we recorded a restructuring and related credit of  of which a credit of  was for employee termination benefits  a credit of  was for sales proceeds received on equipment with no carrying value  a credit of  was for inventory markdowns  a credit of  was for lease termination and other exit costs  offset by a charge of  for other operating costs associated with closed plant facilities 
of this total credit  a charge of  was recorded to cost of sales and a credit of  was recorded to restructuring credit in the consolidated statement of operations 
during fiscal  total restructuring and related charges incurred were million  of which million was for write downs of equipment and buildings  million for inventory markdowns   for employee termination benefits   for lease termination and other exit costs  and  for other operating costs associated with closed plant facilities 
of these total charges  million was recorded in cost of sales   was recorded in selling  general  and administrative expenses  and million was recorded in restructuring expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
of these total charges  million and million represent non cash and cash charges  respectively 
a detailed explanation of each of our significant restructuring plans for fiscal and is presented below 
september upholstery fabrics on september   our board of directors approved changes to the upholstery fabric operations  including the consolidation of plant facilities in china and the reduction of excess manufacturing capacity 
these actions were in response to the extremely challenging industry conditions for upholstery fabrics 
the plant closings associated with this restructuring plan have been completed 
during fiscal  a restructuring credit of  was recorded for lease termination and other exit costs 
this  credit was recorded to restructuring credit in the consolidated statement of operations 
during fiscal  restructuring and related charges totaled million  of which million related to impairment charges on equipment and leasehold improvements  million for accelerated depreciation   for inventory markdowns   for lease termination and other exit costs   for other operating costs associated with closed plant facilities  and  for employee termination benefits 
the million accelerated depreciation charge represents the incremental depreciation expense to reflect revised depreciation estimates and useful lives for certain fixed assets that were to be used over a shortened useful life from the period the restructuring plan was announced until the respective plant facility was closed and operations ceased 
of this total charge  million and million were recorded in res tructuring expense and cost of sales  respectively  in the consolidated statement of operations 
december upholstery fabrics on december   our board of directors approved a restructuring plan within the upholstery fabrics segment to consolidate the company s us upholstery fabrics manufacturing facilities and outsource its specialty yarn production 
this process involved closing the company s weaving plant located in graham  north carolina  and closing the yarn plant located in lincolnton  north carolina 
we transferred certain production from the graham plant to our anderson  south carolina and shanghai  china plant facilities as well as a small portion to contract weavers 
during fiscal  we recorded a restructuring credit of  the  represents a credit of  for employee termination benefits  a credit of  for sales proceeds received for equipment with no carrying value  a credit of  for inventory markdowns  offset by a charge of  for lease termination and other exit costs  and a charge of  for other operating costs associated with closed plant facilities 
of this  restructuring credit  a credit of  was recorded in restructuring credit and a credit of  was recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
during fiscal  we further assessed the net realizable value of our inventory  recoverability of our property  plant  and equipment  and selling  general  and administrative expenses based on demand trends related to our us upholstery fabric operations 
this assessment was required based on the adverse economic conditions resulting from the depressed housing market  credit crisis  and decreased consumer spending that developed in the second quarter of fiscal  and which was more severe than we anticipated at the end of fiscal as a result  restructuring and related charges incurred were million  of which million related to impairment charges on a building and equipment   related to inventory markdowns   related to employee termination benefits   related to lease termination and other exi t costs  and  related to other operating costs associated with closed plant facilities 
of this total charge  million was recorded in restructuring expense   was recorded in cost of sales  and  was recorded in selling  general  and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
long lived asset impairments during fiscal  we did not incur any impairment charges regarding our upholstery fabric property  plant  and equipment 
during fiscal  we incurred impairment charges on property  plant  and equipment in connection with our restructuring activities 
these impairment charges totaled million and were recorded in restructuring expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
this million impairment charge includes million for fixed assets that were abandoned in connection with the consolidation of certain plant facilities in china and  to reflect the million selling price of the company s corporate headquarters 
also  during the course of the company s strategic review in the second quarter of fiscal of its upholstery fabrics business  we assessed the recoverability of the carrying value of our upholstery fabric fixed assets that were being held and used in operations 
this strategic review resulted in impairment losses of million and  for fixed assets located in china and the us  respectively 
in addition  we incurred impairment losses totaling  for assets held for sale associated with its u 
s upholstery fabric operations 
these losses reflect the amounts by which the carrying values of these fixed assets exceeded their estimated fair values determined by their estimated future discounted cash flows and quoted market prices 
management remains cautiously optimistic about the company s long term prospects in the upholstery fabrics business  especially in light of much improved financial performance of this segment 
while the recent improvements in this business are favorable indicators  we remain committed to taking additional steps if necessary to maintain the profitability of the company s upholstery fabrics operations  regardless of prevailing economic and business conditions 
we could experience additional inventory markdowns and further restructuring charges in the upholstery fabric operations if current favorable trends in profitability do not continue 
other income statement categories selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a for the company as a whole were million  or of net sales  for fiscal compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal  an increase of 
this increase in sg a expenses primarily pertains to an increase in stock based compensation expense reflecting an increase in the company s stock price and an increase in incentive compensation expense as a result of significantly improved financial performance 
interest expense income interest expense for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this trend reflects lower outstanding balances on our long term debt 
interest income for fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal this increase reflects our higher cash and short term investment balances in fiscal compared with other expense other expense for fiscal was  compared with  in fiscal this change primarily reflects fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for our subsidiary domiciled in canada 
as a result of the our increased cash and short term investment position in fiscal  we are currently trying to maintain a natural hedge by keeping an equal balance of our assets and liabilities denominated in canadian dollars 
we expect other expense to decrease in fiscal if we are able to maintain this natural hedge 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by asc topic  income taxes 
this approach requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which differences are expected to reverse  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and tax basis of an asset or liability 
if a change in the effective tax rate t o be applied to a timing difference is determined to be appropriate  it will affect the provision for income taxes during the period that the determination is made 
effective income tax rate we recorded income tax expense of million  or of income before income tax expense  in fiscal compared to income tax expense of million  or of loss before income tax expense in fiscal income tax expense for fiscal is different from the amount obtained by applying our statutory rate of to income before income taxes for the following reasons the income tax rate decreased for the reduction in the valuation allowance recorded against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets associated with our us and china operations 
this reduction in our valuation allowance is primarily due to us taxable income generated by the repatriation of undistributed earnings from our subsidiaries located in china and the resulting usage of us net operating loss carryforwards 
also  this reduction pertains to the realization on and projected realization of deferred tax assets created from tax versus book depreciation associated with the company s china operations 
the income tax rate decreased for the tax effects of foreign exchange losses on us denominated account balances in which income taxes are paid in canadian dollars 
in fiscal  the income tax rate increased for the tax effects of foreign exchange gains on us denominated account balances in which income taxes are paid in canadian dollars 
in fiscal and  the canadian foreign exchange rate in relation to the us dollar was very volatile due to changes in oil prices and global economic conditions 
the income tax rate decreased for taxable income subject to lower statutory income rates in foreign jurisdictions canada and china compared with the statutory income tax rate of for the united states 
the income tax rate increased for the recording of a deferred tax liability for estimated us income taxes that were paid upon repatriation of undistributed earnings from the company s subsidiaries located in china 
the income tax rate increased for an increase in unrecognized tax benefits 
the income tax rate increased for non deductible stock based compensation expense and other miscellaneous items 
the income tax benefit for fiscal is different from the amount obtained by applying our statutory rate of to loss before income taxes for the following reasons the income tax rate increased for a million non cash charge for the establishment of a valuation allowance against substantially all of the company s net deferred tax assets 
the income tax rate increased for an increase in unrecognized tax benefits 
the income tax rate increased for the tax effects of foreign exchange gains on us denominated account balances in which income taxes are paid in canadian dollars 
in fiscal  the canadian foreign exchange rate in relation to the us dollar was very volatile due to changes in oil prices and global economic conditions 
the income tax rate increased for the recording of a deferred tax liability for estimated us income taxes that were paid upon repatriation of undistributed earnings from the company s subsidiaries located in china 
the income tax rate increased for non deductible stock based compensation expense and other miscellaneous items 
deferred income taxes in accordance with asc topic  we evaluate our deferred income taxes to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
asc topic requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
since the company operates in multiple jurisdictions  we assess the need for a valuation allowance on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  taking into account the effects of local tax law 
based on this assessment  we recorded a valuation allowance of million at may  this valuation allowance of million consists of a full valuation allowance of million against our net deferred assets associated with our us op erations and a partial valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets associated with our china operations 
our net deferred tax asset regarding our us operations primarily resulted from the recording of the income tax benefit of us income tax loss carryforwards over the last several fiscal years  which totaled million at may  the cumulative us pre tax losses incurred over the last several fiscal years  the significant uncertainty in current and expected demand for furniture and mattresses  and the prevailing uncertainty in the overall economic climate  have made it very difficult to forecast our financial results associated with our us operations 
based on this significant negative evidence  we maintain our position that it is more likely than not that the us net deferred tax assets will not be fully recovered 
consequently  we recorded a full allowance of million against our us net deferred tax assets 
our net deferred tax asset regarding our china operations primarily pertains to the book versus tax basis difference associated with our china operations fixed assets 
this book versus tax basis difference resulted from our impairment losses and fixed asset write downs associated with our september upholstery fabrics restructuring plan see note 
in order for this net deferred tax asset to be realized  our china operations must have sufficient pre tax income levels to utilize tax depreciation expense each of the next four fiscal years 
due to the favorable results from our restructuring activities and profit improvement plan initiated in the second quarter of fiscal  our china operations have been restored to profitability  reporting pre tax income of million in fiscal although our china operations report ed pre tax income of million in fiscal  on a cumulative basis over the last three fiscal years  our china operations have substantially performed on a break even basis achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
the significant uncertainty in current and expected demand for furniture  and the prevailing uncertainty in the overall economic climate  has made it very difficult to forecast medium and long term financial results associated with our china operations 
based on the current economic conditions  we believe it is too uncertain to project pre tax income associated with our china operations after fiscal based on this significant positive and negative evidence  we recorded a partial valuation allowance of million against net deferred tax assets associated with our china operations for tax versus book depreciation that is expected to reverse beyond fiscal and we recognized an income tax benefit of  in fiscal for the reduction in this valuation allowance for the t ax versus book depreciation that is projected to reverse in fiscal due to cumulative losses associated with our operations in the us and china  we established a full valuation allowance against our us and china net deferred taxes totaling million in fiscal of this million valuation allowance  million and million pertained to our us and china operations  respectively 
in fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of million for the reduction of this valuation allowance 
this million decrease results from the realization of loss carryforwards associated with the company s us operations and the realization and projected realization of tax versus book depreciation associated with the company s china operations  as discussed above 
the recorded valuation allowance of million has no effect on our operations  loan covenant compliance  or the possible realization of the us income tax loss carryforwards in the future 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not that we will realize any of these us income tax loss carryforwards  an income tax benefit would be recognized at that time 
at may   the current deferred tax asset of  represents  and  from our operations located in canada and china  respectively 
at may   the non current deferred tax asset of  pertains to our operations located in china 
at may   the non current deferred tax liability of  pertains to our operations located in canada 
at may   the current deferred tax asset of  and the non current deferred tax liability of  pertained to our operations located in canada 
income tax payments  net of income tax refunds  were million in   in  and  in see notes and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details

at may  and april   this segment had assets held for sale with carrying values totaling  and  respectively 
effective january   we adopted a plan to sell certain older equipment related to the mattress fabrics segment that was being replaced by newer and more efficient equipment

the increase in the carrying value of the non compete agreements and goodwill pertains to the bodet horst acquisition 
at may  and april   property  plant and equipment totaled million and million  respectively 
this increase primarily reflects the completion of a million capital project and property  plant  and equipment purchased in connection with the bodet horst acquisition  offset by depreciation expense of million in fiscal the million balance at may   represents property  plant  and equipment located in the us of million and located in canada of million 
the million balance at april  represents property  plant  and equipment located in the us of million  located in canada of million  and corporate allocations of  bodet horst asset acquisition pursuant to an asset purchase agreement among the company  bodet horst usa  lp and bodet horst gmbh co

this purchase allowed us to have a vertically integrated manufacturing platform in all major product categories of the mattress fabrics industry 
the purchase involved the equipment  inventory  and intellectual property associated with the high point manufacturing operation  which had served as our primary source of knitted mattress fabric prior to the acquisition 
demand for this product line has grown significantly  as knits are increasingly being utiliz ed on mattresses at volume retail price points 
the purchase price for the assets was cash in the amount of million  which included an adjustment of  for changes in working capital as defined in the asset purchase agreement  and the assumption of certain liabilities

a detailed explanation of each of our significant restructuring plans for fiscal and is presented below 
september upholstery fabrics during fiscal  restructuring and related charges totaled million  of which million related to impairment charges on equipment and leasehold improvements  million for accelerated depreciation   for inventory markdowns   for lease termination and other exit costs   for other operating costs associated with closed plant facilities  and  for employee termination benefits 
the million accelerated depreciation charge represents the incremental depreciation expense to reflect revised depreciation estimates and useful lives for certain fixed assets that were to be used over a shortened useful life from the period the restructuring plan was announced until the respective plant facility was closed and operations ceased 
of this total charge  million and million were recorded in res tructuring expense and cost of sales  respectively  in the consolidated statement of operations 
no restructuring and related charges were incurred in fiscal  as this restructuring plan was initiated in the second quarter of fiscal december upholstery fabrics during fiscal  we further assessed the net realizable value of our inventory  recoverability of our property  plant  and equipment  and selling  general  and administrative expenses based on current demand trends related to our us upholstery fabric operations 
this assessment was required based on the adverse economic conditions resulting from the depressed housing market  credit crisis  and decreased consumer spending that developed in the second quarter of fiscal  and which was more severe than we anticipated at the end of fiscal as a result  restructuring and related charges incurred were million of which million related to impairment charges on a building and equipment   related to inventory markdowns   related to employee termination benefits   related to lease termination and ot her exit costs  and  related to other operating costs associated with closed plant facilities 
of this total charge  million was recorded in restructuring expense   was recorded in cost of sales  and  was recorded in selling  general  and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations

other income statement categories selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a for the company as a whole were million  or of net sales  for fiscal compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal  a decrease of 
this trend primarily reflected the company s restructuring efforts and profit improvement plan associated with its upholstery fabrics segment  partially offset by an increase of  in the provision for doubtful accounts in fiscal interest expense income interest expense for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this trend primarily reflected lower outstanding balances on existing long term debt and a decrease in interest rates  partially offset by interest expense incurred on the million unsecured note used to finance the bodet horst acquisition 
interest income for fiscal decreased to  from  in fiscal this trend reflected a significant reduction in money market interest rates during fiscal other expense other expense for fiscal was  compared with  in fiscal this change primarily reflected fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for our subsidiary domiciled in canada 
income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million  or of loss before income tax expense in fiscal compared to an income tax benefit of  or of income before income taxes in fiscal income tax expense for fiscal is different from the amount obtained by applying our statutory rate of to loss before income taxes for the following reasons the income tax rate increased for a million non cash charge for the establishment of a valuation allowance against substantially all of the company s net deferred tax assets

under a tax holiday in the people s republic of china  the company was granted an exemption from income taxes for two years commencing from the first profit making year on a calendar year basis and a reduction in income tax rates for the following three years 
calendar year was the first profit making year 
we were entitled to a income tax reduction through december  the income tax rate was reduced by for the tax effects of the tax holiday in china in fiscal this decrease compared with fiscal is due to lower pre tax income in fiscal for our china operations

handling costs the company records warehousing costs in selling  general and administrative expenses 
these costs were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
warehousing costs include the operating expenses of the company s various finished goods distribution centers  such as personnel costs  utilities  building rent and material handling equipment  and lease expense 
had these costs been included in cost of sales  gross profit would have been million  or  in fiscal  million  or  in fiscal  and million  or  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources liquidity our sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations  and amounts available under our unsecured revolving credit lines 
these sources have been adequate for day to day operations and capital expenditures 
we believe our present cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balance of million  cash flow from operations  and current availability under our unsecured revolving credit lines will be sufficient to fund our business needs and fiscal contractual obligations see below commitments table

cash flow from operations in fiscal primarily represented cash flow from earnings generated from the mattress fabrics segment and working capital reductions in both segments 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balance also reflects cash outlays for capital expenditures totaling million during fiscal  payments on long term debt of million  payments on vendor financed capital expenditures and a capital lease obligation totaling million  offset by cash proceeds received on the sale of common stock and equipment totaling million 
we reduced our total long term debt  including current maturities  to million at may  from million at may  this reduction primarily related to the last principal payment of million made in march on our prior unsecured term notes 
cash flow from operations and the sale of the corporate headquarters see below allowed us to substantially reduce total borrowings during fiscal during fiscal  we repaid million in long term debt  of which million related to principal payments due in march and june our long term debt balance was million and million at may  and april   respectively

all of our long term debt and line of credit agreements are unsecured 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balance may be adversely affected by factors beyond our control  such as weakening industry demand and delays in receipt of payment on accounts receivable 
corporate headquarters office space effective january   we sold our corporate headquarters building in high point  north carolina for a purchase price of million

on july   we entered into a fourteenth amendment to this revolving credit agreement 
this amendment extended the expiration date to august  it is management s intention to extend this revolving credit agreement

this amendment provided greater flexibility by increasing the capital expenditure limit on a cash basis from million to million for fiscal in addition  for any fiscal year after fiscal  capital expenditures are not to exceed the sum of million and such additional amount of capital expenditures that would not cause the company to be in noncompliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the agreement

as more fully disclosed in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company adopted certain provisions of asc topic  income taxes formerly known as financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which supplements sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
at may   the company had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits  of which million and million were classified as net non current deferred income taxes and income taxes payable long term 
the final outcome of these tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations  legal proceedings  competent authority proceedings  changes in regulatory tax laws  or interpretations of those tax laws  or expiration of statutes of limitation 
as a result of these inhe rent uncertainties  the company cannot reasonably estimate the timing of payment of these amounts 
of the million in total gross unrecognized tax benefits  million would not be subject to cash payments due to the company s us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
capital expenditures capital expenditures on an accrual and cash basis for fiscal were million 
the capital spending of million consisted of million for the mattress fabrics segment   for the upholstery fabrics segment  and  for unallocated corporate 
depreciation expense for fiscal was million  of which million related to the mattress fabrics segment and  related to the upholstery fabrics segment 
depreciation expense for the upholstery fabrics segment included a  charge related to the reclassification of certain upholstery fabric assets classified from held for sale to held and used included in property  plant  and equipment on the may  consolidated balance sheet 
for fiscal  we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately million  which we plan to fund from cash flow from operations 
planned capital expenditures for fiscal primarily relate to the mattress fabrics segment 
for fiscal  we currently expect depreciation expense to be approximately million  which primarily relates to the mattress fabrics segment 
accounts payable capital expenditures at may   we had total amounts due for capital expenditures totaling  of which  was vendor financed and  was non vendor financed 
the company s vendor financed arrangement bears interest with a fixed interest rate of 
during august  we prepaid and paid in full  on a vendor financed arrangement that had a fixed interest rate of 
the total outstanding amount of  is required to be paid in full in fiscal capital lease obligation in may  we entered into a capital lease to finance a portion of the construction of certain equipment related to our mattress fabrics segment 
the lease agreement contained a bargain purchase option and incurred interest at a rate of 
the lease agreement required total principal payments totaling million which commenced on july   and was paid in full by the end of fiscal this agreement was secured by equipment with a carrying value of million 
inflation any significant increase in our raw material costs  utility energy costs and general economic inflation could have a material adverse impact on the company  because competitive conditions have limited our ability to pass significant operating increases on to customers 
critical accounting policies us generally accepted accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
some of these estimates require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and as a result actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
due to the estimation processes involved  management considers the following summarized accounting policies and their application to be critical to understanding the company s business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from residential and commercial furniture and bedding manufacturers 
ownership of these manufacturers is increasingly concentrated and certain bedding manufacturers have a high degree of leverage 
as of may   accounts receivable from furniture manufacturers totaled approximately million  and accounts receivable from bedding manufacturers totaled approximately million 
additionally  as of may   the aggregate accounts receivable balance of the company s ten largest customers was million  or of trade accounts receivable 
one customer with in the upholstery fabrics segment represented of consolidated accounts receivable at may  no customers within the mattress fabrics segment represented more than of consolidated accounts receivable at may  we continuously perform credit evaluations of its customers  considering numerous inputs including customers financial position  past payment history  cash flows and management capability  historical loss experience  and economic conditions and prospects 
once evaluated  each customer is assigned a credit grade 
credit grades are adjusted as warranted 
significant management judgment and estimates must be used in connection with establishing the reserve for allowance for doubtful accounts 
while management believes that adequate allowances for doubtful accounts have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  it is possible that we could experience additional unexpected credit losses 
the reserve balance for doubtful accounts was million and million at may  and may   respectively 
inventory valuation 
we operate as a make to order and make to stock business 
although management closely monitors demand in each product area to decide which patterns and styles to hold in inventory  the increasing availability of low cost imports and the gradual shifts in consumer preferences expose the company to markdowns of inventory 
management continually examines inventory to determine if there are indicators that the carrying value exceeds its net realizable value 
experience has shown that the most significant indicator of the need for inventory markdowns is the age of the inventory and the planned discontinuance of certain patterns 
as a result  the company provides inventory valuation markdowns based upon set percentages for inventory aging categories  generally using six  nine  twelve and fifteen month categories 
while management believes that adequate markdowns for excess and obsolete inventory have been made in the consolidated financial statements  significant unanticipated changes in demand or changes in consumer tastes and preferences could result in additional excess and obsolete inventory in the future 
the reserve for inventory markdowns was million and million at may  and may   respectively 
long lived assets 
management reviews long lived assets  which consist principally of property  plant and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered 
recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset 
after the impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount shall be its new accounting basis 
assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell when the company has committed to a disposal plan  and are reported separately as assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the value of assets and result in an impairment charge 
goodwill 
management assesses goodwill for impairment at the end of each fiscal year or between annual tests if an event that occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying values 
at the end of fiscal  we tested for impairment of goodwill utilizing a two step approach 
in the first step  we estimated the fair market values of its reporting units mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics using a present value of future cash flows approach  subject to a comparison for reasonableness to its market capitalization at the date of valuation 
we used a discount rate equal to its average cost of funds to discount the expected future cash flows 
if the fair market value of a reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit was considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in the second step the implied fair market value of the goodwill would be estimated as the fair market value of the reporting unit used in the first step less the fair values of all other net tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded its implied fair market value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
based on the results of the fiscal impairment test  no impairment of goodwill was incurred and the second step of the impairment test was unnecessary 
additionally  the estimated fair value of the mattress fabric segment exceeded its carrying value by approximately million or 
in accordance with asc topic  goodwill and other intangible assets  a detailed determination of the fair value of the reporting unit may be carried forward from one year to the next if all of the following conditions are met a assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed since the most recent fair value determination may   b the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin  c based on analysis of events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination  the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less that the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is remote 
based on our analysis of the above criteria  we ca rried forward our fiscal detailed determination of the fair value of our reporting units to fiscal and therefore  no impairment of goodwill was incurred in fiscal the company s remaining goodwill at may   of million relates to the mattress fabrics segment 
although the company believes it has based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results 
restructuring charges 
in accordance with asc topic  exit or disposal cost obligations  a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity must be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for certain employee termination benefits that qualify under asc topic  nonretirement postemployment benefits 
in fiscal and  the upholstery fabric segment was under significant pressure from a variety of external forces  such as the current consumer preference for leather and suede furniture and the growing competition from imported fabrics and cut and sewn kits 
in an effort to reduce operating expenses and scale us productive capacity in line with current and expected demand trends  we executed restructuring initiatives during the past several years 
these restructuring initiatives have resulted in restructuring charges related to the remaining lease costs of the closed facilities  the write down of property  plant and equipment  workforce reduction and elimination of facilities 
severance and related charges are accrued at the date the restructuring is approved by the board of directors based on an estimate of amounts that will be paid to affected employees  in accordance with asc topic under asc topic  asset impairment charges related to the consolidation or closure of manufacturing facilities are based on an estimate of expected sales prices for the real estate and equipment 
other exit costs  which principally consist of charges for lease termination and losses from termination of existing contracts  equipment relocation costs and inventory markdowns that are related to the restructuring are accounted for in accordance with asc topic we reassess the individual accrual requirements at the end of each reporting period 
if circumstances change  causing current estimates to differ from original estimates  adjustments are recorded in the period of change 
restructuring charges  and adjustments of those charges  are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at income tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income loss in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate our deferred income taxes to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
asc topic requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
since the company operates in multiple jurisdictions  we assess the need for a valuation allowance on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  taking into account the effects of local tax law 
based on this assessment  we recorded a valuation allowance of million at may  this valuation allowance of million consists of a full valuation allowance of million against our net deferred assets associated with our us operations and a partial valuation a llowance of million against our net deferred tax assets associated with our china operations 
our net deferred tax asset regarding our us operations primarily resulted from the recording of the income tax benefit of us income tax loss carryforwards over the last several fiscal years  which totaled million at may  the cumulative us pre tax losses incurred over the last several fiscal years  the significant uncertainty in current and expected demand for furniture and mattresses  and the prevailing uncertainty in the overall economic climate  has made it very difficult to forecast our financial results associated with our us operations 
based on this significant negative evidence  we maintain our position that it is more likely than not that the us net deferred tax assets will not be fully recovered 
consequently  we recorded a full allowance of million against our us net deferred tax assets 
our net deferred tax asset regarding our china operations primarily pertains to the book versus tax basis difference associated with our china operations fixed assets 
this book versus tax basis difference resulted from our impairment losses and fixed asset write downs associated with our september upholstery fabrics restructuring plan see note 
in order for this net deferred tax asset to be realized  our china operations must have sufficient pre tax income levels to utilize tax depreciation expense each of the next four fiscal years 
due to the favorable results from our restructuring activities and profit improvement plan initiated in the second quarter of fiscal  our china operations have been restored to profitability  reporting pre tax income of million in fiscal although our china operations report ed pre tax income of million in fiscal  on a cumulative basis over the last three fiscal years  our china operations have substantially performed on a break even basis achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
the significant uncertainty in current and expected demand for furniture  and the prevailing uncertainty in the overall economic climate  has made it very difficult to forecast medium and long term financial results associated with our china operations 
based on the current economic conditions  we believe it is too uncertain to project pre tax income associated with our china operations after fiscal based on this significant positive and negative evidence  we recorded a partial valuation allowance of million against net deferred tax assets associated with our china operations for tax versus book depreciation that is expected to reverse beyond fiscal and we recognized an income tax benefit of  in fiscal for the reduction in this valuation allowance for the tax versus book depreciation that is projected to reverse in fiscal we adopted certain provisions of asc topic  these provisions were formerly known as financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which supplements sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we must recognize the tax impact from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax impact recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions are recorded as tax expense 
significant judgment is required in the identification of uncertain tax positions and in the estimation of penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions 
at may   the company had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits  of which million and million were classified as net non current deferred income taxes and income taxes payable long term  respectively  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our revolving credit lines 
our revolving credit line in the united states bears interest at the one month libor plus an adjustable margin based on the company s debt ebitda ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
our revolving credit line associated with our china subsidiaries bears interest at a rate determined by the chinese government 
at may   there were no borrowings outstanding under these revolving credit lines 
we are not exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
the company s unsecured term notes issued in connection with the bodet horst acquisition have a fixed interest rate of and the loan associated with the government of quebec is non interest bearing 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in the value of foreign currencies for our subsidiaries domiciled in china and canada 
on january   the company entered into a canadian dollar foreign exchange contract associated with its loan from the government of quebec 
the agreement effectively converted the canadian dollar principal debt payments at a fixed canadian dollar foreign exchange rate versus the united states dollar of 
this agreement was terminated in the first quarter of fiscal see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
additionally  we try to maintain a natural hedge by keeping an equal balance of our assets and liabilities denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries domiciled in china and canada  although there is no assurance that we will be able to continually maintain this natural hedge 
our foreign subsidiaries use the united states dollar as their functional currency 
a substantial portion of our imports purchased outside the united states are denominated in us dollars 
a change in either exchange rate at may   would not have had a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position
