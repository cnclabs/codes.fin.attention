item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents resellers 
we rely on many resellers worldwide that sell directly to end user customer 
our resellers include regional networking system resellers  resellers who focus on specific vertical markets  value added resellers  network integrators and wholesale resellers 
we provide training and support to our resellers and our resellers generally provide the first level of contact to end users of our products 
our relationships with resellers are generally on a non exclusive basis 
our resellers are not given rights to return inventory and do not automatically participate in any cooperative marketing programs 
we generally recognize product revenue from our reseller and end user customers at the time of shipment  provided other revenue recognition criteria are met 
when significant obligations or contingencies remain after products are delivered  such as installation or customer acceptance  revenue and related costs are deferred until such obligations or contingencies are satisfied 
see revenue recognition in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
field sales 
we have trained our field sales organization to support and develop leads for our resellers and to establish and maintain key accounts and strategic end user customers 
to support these objectives  our field sales force assists end user customers in finding solutions to complex network system and architecture problems  differentiates the features and capabilities of our products from competitive offerings  continually monitors and understands the evolving networking needs of enterprise and service provider customers  promotes our products and ensures direct contact with current and potential customers  assists our resellers to drive to closure business opportunities  and monitors the changing requirements of our customers 
as of june   our worldwide sales and marketing organization consisted of individuals  including directors  managers  sales representatives  and technical and administrative support personnel 
we have domestic sales offices located in states and international sales offices located in countries 
international sales international sales are an important portion of our business 
in fiscal  sales to customers outside of north america accounted for of our consolidated net revenue  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal these sales are conducted primarily through foreign based distributors and resellers managed by our worldwide sales organization 
in addition  we have direct sales to end user customers  including large global accounts 
the primary markets for sales outside of north america are countries in europe and asia

long lived assets see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for more information regarding our long lived assets 
marketing we continue to develop and execute on a number of marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of our products by communicating the value of our solutions to our existing and potential customers  our distribution channels and our resellers 
our marketing efforts include participation in industry tradeshows  technical conferences and technology seminars  preparation of competitive analyses  sales training  and publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals  a publicly available website  promotions  web based training courses  advertising and public relations 
we also submit our products for independent product testing and evaluation 

table of contents backlog our products are often sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancelable prior to shipment without significant penalties 
in addition  purchase orders are subject to changes in quantities of products and delivery schedules in order to reflect changes in customer requirements and manufacturing capacity 
our business is characterized by seasonal variability in demand and short lead time orders and delivery schedules 
actual shipments depend on the then current capacity of our contract manufacturers and the availability of materials and components from our vendors 
we believe that only a small portion of our order backlog is non cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non cancelable portion is not material 
accordingly  we do not believe that backlog at any given time is a meaningful indicator of future revenue 
seasonality like many of our competitors  we historically have experienced seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns  which generally adversely affect our first and third fiscal quarters 
this pattern should not be relied upon  however  as it has varied in the past 
customer service and support our customers seek high reliability and maximum uptime for their networks 
to that extent  we provide the following service offerings support services for end users  resellers and distributors 
we meet the service requirements of our customers and channel partners through our technical assistance centers  or tacs  located in santa clara  california  utrecht  netherlands  research triangle park  north carolina  and tokyo  japan 
our tac engineers and technicians assist in diagnosing and troubleshooting technical issues regarding customer networks 
development engineers work with the tacs to resolve product functionality issues specific to each customer 
professional services 
we provide consultative services to improve customer productivity in all phases of the network lifecycle planning  design  implementation  operations and optimization management 
our network architects develop and execute customized hardware deployment plans to meet individualized network strategies 
these activities may include the management and coordination of the design and network configuration  resource planning  staging  logistics  migration and deployment 
we also provide customized training and operational best practices documentation to assist customers in the transition and sustaining of their networks 
education 
our classes cover a wide range of topics such as installation  configuration  operation  management and optimization providing customers with the necessary knowledge and experience to successfully deploy and manage our products in various networking environments 
classes may be scheduled and available at numerous locations worldwide 
we deliver training using our staff  on line training classes and authorized training partners 
in addition  we make much of our training materials accessible free of charge on our internet site for customers and partners to use in self education 
we believe this approach enhances the market s ability to learn and understand the broad array of advantages of our products 
manufacturing we outsource the majority of our manufacturing and supply chain management operations as part of our strategy to maintain global manufacturing capabilities and to reduce our costs 
we conduct quality assurance  manufacturing engineering  document control and test development at our main campus in santa clara  california 
this approach enables us to reduce fixed costs and to flexibly respond to changes in market demand 
we have a relationship with flextronics international  ltd 
for the manufacture of some of our products in guadalajara  mexico 
flextronics manufacturing processes and procedures are iso certified 
we determine the components that are incorporated in our products and select the appropriate suppliers of such components 

table of contents we also maintain a relationship with alpha networks  inc headquartered in hsinchu  taiwan 
alpha networks is a global networking original design manufacturer odm leader with core competencies in areas such as ethernet  lan man  wireless  broadband and voip 
alpha networks manufacturing processes and procedures are iso certified 
we partner with alpha networks to design and build some of our products 
we have a relationship with benchmark electronics huntsville inc for the manufacture of some of our products in huntsville  alabama 
benchmark manufacturing processes and procedures are iso certified 
we determine the components that are incorporated in our products and select the appropriate suppliers of such components 
our wireless products are supplied under an oem supply agreement with symbol technologies  inc  a subsidiary of motorola  inc motorola 
motorola rebrands and customizes the wireless products for us to resell to customers 
motorola s manufacturing processes and procedures are iso certified 
motorola has made ongoing supply and support commitments during the term of the agreement and is required to provide support for a defined period of time after any termination of the agreement 
these manufacturers utilize automated testing equipment to perform product testing and burn in with specified tests 
together we rely upon comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls to assure the quality and reliability of our products 
we use our forecast of expected demand to determine our material requirements 
lead times for materials and components vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
we order most of our materials and components on an indirect basis through our contract manufacturer 
purchase commitments with our manufacturers are generally on a purchase order basis 
research and development the success of our products to date is due in large part to our focus on research and development 
we believe that continued success in the marketplace will depend on our ability to develop new and enhanced products employing leading edge technology 
accordingly  we are undertaking development efforts with an emphasis on increasing the reliability  performance and features of our family of products  and designing innovative products to reduce the overall network operating costs of customers 
our product development activities focus on solving the needs of enterprises  data centers  and service providers 
current activities include the continuing development of our innovative switching technology aimed at extending the capabilities of our products 
our ongoing research activities cover a broad range of areas  including  in particular  gigabit and higher speed ethernet  metro and internet routing  network security  network management software  datacenter equipment broadband access equipment and wireless networking equipment 
we continued to enhance the functionality of our modular operating system extremexos which has been designed to provide high reliability and availability 
this allows us to leverage a common operating system across different hardware and network chipsets 
as of june   our research and development organization consisted of individuals 
research and development efforts are conducted in several locations  including santa clara  california  raleigh  north carolina  and chennai  india 
our research and development expenses in fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents competition the market for network switches  which is part of the broader market for networking equipment  is extremely competitive and characterized by rapid technological progress  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
we believe the principal competitive factors in the network switching market are expertise and familiarity with network protocols  network switching and network management  product performance  features  functionality and reliability  price performance characteristics  timeliness of new product introductions  adoption of emerging industry standards  customer service and support  size and scope of distribution network  brand name  breadth of product offering  access to customers  and size of installed customer base 
we believe that we compete with our competitors with respect to many of the foregoing factors 
however  the market for network switching solutions is dominated by a few large companies  particularly cisco systems  inc in addition to cisco systems  we compete with public and private companies that offer switching solutions or provide alternative networking solutions  including  alcatel lucent  brocade communications systems  inc  hewlett packard company  huawei technologies corporation  juniper networks  inc and siemens enterprise communications gmbh co 
kg 
most of these competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  broader product lines and substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
based on our commitment to build a patent portfolio  we have in process a number of patent applications relating to our proprietary technology in the united states and in selected other countries 
with respect to trademarks  we have a number of pending and registered trademarks in the united states and abroad 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to  and distribution of  our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
in addition  we provide our software products to end user customers primarily under shrink wrap license agreements 
these agreements are not negotiated with or signed by the licensee  and thus these agreements may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
environment we maintain compliance with various regulations related to the environment  including the waste electrical and electronic equipment and restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and 
table of contents electronic equipment regulations adopted by the european union 
further  we are committed to energy efficiency in our product lines 
for example  certain of our products consume far less power than offerings from our major competitors 
accordingly  we believe this is an area that affords us a competitive advantage for our products in the marketplace 
to date  our compliance efforts with various us and foreign regulations related to the environment has not had a material effect on our operating results 
employees as of june   we employed people  including in sales and marketing  in research and development  in operations  in customer support and service  and in finance and administration 
we have never had a work stoppage and no personnel are represented under collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
we believe that our future success depends on our continued ability to attract  integrate  retain  train and motivate highly qualified personnel  and upon the continued service of our senior management and key personnel 
none of our executive officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement which mandates that the employee render services for any specific term 
the market for qualified personnel is competitive  particularly in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters is located

item a 
risk factors the following is a list of risks and uncertainties which may have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the risks and uncertainties set out below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face  and some are endemic to the networking industry 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future because a number of factors could negatively affect our financial results 
although we reported profits for fiscal  we have reported losses in some of our prior fiscal years 
in addition  in years when we reported profits  we were not profitable in each quarter during those years 
we anticipate continuing to incur significant sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses 
a high percentage of these expenses are fixed in the short term  so any delay in generating or recognizing revenue could result in a loss for a quarter or full year 
even if we are profitable  our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our stock to fall 
we may experience challenges or delays in generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons and our revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following we are dependent upon obtaining orders during a quarter and shipping those orders in the same quarter to achieve our revenue objectives  acceptance provisions in customer contracts  our ability to deliver installation or inspection services by the end of the quarter  changes in general and or specific economic conditions in the networking industry  seasonal fluctuations in demand for our products and services  particularly in asia and europe  the level of attrition of our employees  and of our sales force in particular  
table of contents a disproportionate percentage of our sales occurring in the last month of the quarter  our ability to ship products by the end of a quarter  reduced visibility into the implementation cycles for our products and our customers spending plans  our ability to forecast demand for our products  which in the case of lower than expected sales  may result in excess or obsolete inventory in addition to non cancelable purchase commitments for component parts  sales to the telecommunications service provider market  which represent a significant source of large product orders  are especially volatile and difficult to forecast  product returns or the cancellation or rescheduling of orders  our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements and manage product transitions  announcements and new product introductions by our competitors  our ability to develop and support relationships with enterprise customers  service providers and other potential large customers  our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions  fluctuations in warranty or other service expenses actually incurred  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products on a timely basis  increases in the prices of the components that we purchase  decreases in the prices of the products that we sell  our ability to manage and maintain our relationships with our manufacturing partners including our ability to achieve and maintain desired production volumes and quality levels for our products  the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which products are sold  impairment charges associated with long lived assets  restructuring costs associated with adjustments to the size of our operations  costs relating to possible acquisitions and the integration of technologies or businesses  the effect of amortization of purchased intangibles resulting from new transactions  costs relating to the recognition of share based payments  and the potential future adoption of certain accounting standards new to our business 
due to the foregoing factors  period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
intense competition in the market for networking equipment could prevent us from increasing revenue and achieving profitability 
the market for network switching solutions is intensely competitive and dominated primarily by cisco systems and a few other large companies 
most of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  broader product lines and substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources 
as a result  these competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
in addition  they have larger distribution channels  stronger brand names  access to more customers  a larger installed customer base and a greater ability to make 
table of contents attractive offers to channel partners and customers than we do 
for example  we have encountered  and expect to continue to encounter  many potential customers who are confident in and committed to the product offerings of our principal competitors  including cisco systems 
accordingly  these potential customers may not consider or evaluate our products 
when such potential customers have considered or evaluated our products  we have in the past lost  and expect in the future to lose  sales to some of these customers as large competitors have offered significant price discounts to secure these sales 
the pricing policies of our competitors impact the overall demand for our products and services 
some of our competitors are capable of operating at significant losses for extended periods of time  increasing pricing pressure on our products and services 
if we do not maintain competitive pricing  the demand for our products and services  as well as our market share  may decline 
from time to time  we may lower the prices of our products and services in response to competitive pressure 
when this happens  if we are unable to reduce our component costs or improve operating efficiencies  our revenue and margins will be adversely affected 
our success is dependent on our ability to continually introduce new products and features that achieve broad market acceptance 
the network equipment market is characterized by rapid technological progress  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
if we do not regularly introduce new products in this dynamic environment  our product lines will become obsolete 
these new products must be compatible and interoperate with products and architectures offered by other vendors 
we have and may in the future experience delays in product development and releases  and such delays have and could in the future adversely affect our ability to compete and our operating results 
when we announce new products or product enhancements that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products  customers may defer or cancel orders for our existing products 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by unexpectedly decreasing sales  increasing inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
even if we introduce new switching products  alternative technologies could achieve widespread market acceptance and displace the ethernet technology on which we have based our product architecture 
for example  developments in routers and routing software could significantly reduce demand for our products 
as a result  we may not be able to achieve widespread market acceptance of our current or future new products 
the unfavorable economic environment has and may continue to negatively impact our business and operating results 
the challenges and uncertainty currently affecting global economic conditions may negatively impact our business and operating results in the following ways customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services  customers may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  the amounts that they owe us which may adversely affect our cash flow  the timing of our revenue recognition and the amount of revenue  increased pricing pressure may result from our competitors aggressively discounting their products  accurate budgeting and planning will be difficult due to low visibility into future sales  forecasting customer demand will be more difficult increasing the risk of either excess and obsolete inventory if our forecast is too high or insufficient inventory to meet customer demand if our forecast is too low  and our component suppliers and contract manufacturers have been negatively affected by the economy which may result in product delays and changes in pricing and service levels 
if global economic conditions do not show continued improvement  we believe that we will experience material adverse impacts to our business and operating results 

table of contents claims of infringement by others may increase and the resolution of such claims may adversely affect our operating results 
our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patents  copyrights including rights to open source software  and other intellectual property rights 
because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field  the secrecy of some pending patents and the issuance of new patents at a rapid pace  it is not possible to determine in advance if a product or component might infringe the patent rights of others 
because of the potential for courts awarding substantial damages and the lack of predictability of such awards  it is not uncommon for companies in our industry to settle even potentially unmeritorious claims for very substantial amounts 
further  the entities with whom we have or could have disputes or discussions include entities with extensive patent portfolios and substantial financial assets 
these entities are actively engaged in programs to generate substantial revenue from their patent portfolios and are seeking or may seek significant payments or royalties from us and others in our industry 
litigation resulting from claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others has resulted and could in the future result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have received notices from entities alleging that we may be infringing their patents  and we are currently parties to patent litigation as described under part i  item  legal proceedings 
without regard to the merits of these or any other claims  an adverse court order or a settlement could require us  among other actions  to stop selling our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a royalty bearing license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or available at all  pay damages  or redesign those products that use the disputed technology 
in addition  our products include so called open source software 
open source software is typically licensed for use at no initial charge  but imposes on the user of the open source software certain requirements to license to others both the open source software as well as modifications to the open source software 
our use of open source software subjects us to certain additional risks for the following reasons open source license terms may be ambiguous and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products  open source software cannot be protected under trade secret law  suppliers of open source software do not provide the warranty  support and liability protections typically provided by vendors who offer proprietary software  and it may be difficult for us to accurately determine the developers of the open source code and whether the acquired software infringes third party intellectual property rights 
we believe that even if we do not infringe the rights of others  we will incur significant expenses in the future due to disputes or licensing negotiations  though the amounts cannot be determined 
these expenses may be material or otherwise adversely affect our operating results 
our operating results may be negatively affected by defending or pursuing claims or lawsuits 
we have and may in the future pursue or be subject to claims or lawsuits in the normal course of our business 
in addition to the intellectual property lawsuits described above  we are currently parties to securities and contract litigation as described in item legal proceedings 
regardless of the result  litigation can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal 
table of contents proceedings are difficult to predict 
an unfavorable resolution of a lawsuit in which we are a defendant could result in a court order against us or payments to other parties that would have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
even if we are successful in prosecuting claims and lawsuits  we may not recover damages sufficient to cover our expenses incurred to manage  investigate and pursue the litigation 
in addition  subject to certain limitations  we may be obligated to indemnify our current and former directors  officers and employees in certain lawsuits 
we do not maintain insurance coverage which will cover all of our litigation costs and liabilities 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  our business could suffer 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot ensure that the actions we have taken will adequately protect our intellectual property rights or that other parties will not independently develop similar or competing products that do not infringe on our patents 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to and distribution of our intellectual property and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise misappropriate or use our products or technology  which would adversely affect our business 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decrease  which may reduce gross margin and or revenue 
the network equipment industry has traditionally experienced an erosion of average selling prices due to a number of factors  including competitive pricing pressures  promotional pricing and technological progress 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures  excess inventories  increased sales discounts and new product introductions by us or our competitors 
we may experience substantial decreases in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 
to maintain our gross margin  we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements and continually reduce our product costs 
our failure to do so would likely cause our revenue and gross margins to decline 
when our products contain undetected errors  we may incur significant unexpected expenses and could lose sales 
network products frequently contain undetected errors when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are released to the marketplace 
in the past  we have experienced such errors in connection with new products and product updates 
we have experienced component problems in prior years that caused us to incur higher than expected warranty  service costs and expenses  and other related operating expenses 
in the future  we expect that  from time to time  such errors or component failures will be found in new or existing products after the commencement of commercial shipments 
these problems may have a material adverse effect on our business by causing us to incur significant warranty  repair and replacement costs  diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from new product development efforts  delaying the recognition of revenue and causing significant customer relations problems 
further  if products are not accepted by customers due to such defects  and such returns exceed the amount we accrued for defective returns based on our historical experience  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems 
the occurrence of system errors  whether or not caused by our products  could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses 
the occurrence of any such problems would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents we purchase several key components for products from single or limited sources and could lose sales if these suppliers fail to meet our needs 
we currently purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources and are dependent upon supply from these sources to meet our needs 
certain components such as tantalum capacitors  sram  dram  and printed circuit boards  have been in the past  and may in the future be  in short supply 
we have encountered  and are likely in the future to encounter  shortages and delays in obtaining these or other components  and this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer orders 
our principal sole source components include asics  merchant silicon  microprocessors  programmable integrated circuits  selected other integrated circuits  custom power supplies  and custom tooled sheet metal 
our principal limited source components include flash memory  drams and srams  printed circuit boards  and cams 
we use our forecast of expected demand to determine our material requirements 
lead times for materials and components we order vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
if forecasts exceed orders  we may have excess and or obsolete inventory  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
if orders exceed forecasts  we may have inadequate supplies of certain materials and components  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer delivery requirements and to recognize revenue 
generally  we do not have agreements fixing long term prices or minimum volume requirements from suppliers 
from time to time we have experienced shortages and allocations of certain components  resulting in delays in filling orders 
qualifying new suppliers to compensate for such shortages may be time consuming and costly  and may increase the likelihood of errors in design or production 
in addition  during the development of our products  we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our chipsets  which in turn has led to delays in product introductions 
similar delays may occur in the future 
furthermore  the performance of the components as incorporated in our products may not meet the quality requirements of our customers 
our dependence on three manufacturers for all of our manufacturing requirements could harm our operating results 
we primarily rely on three manufacturing partners to manufacture our products 
in addition  each of our products is manufactured by only one of these companies 
we have experienced delays in product shipments from our manufacturing partners in the past  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
these or similar problems may arise in the future  such as delivery of products of inferior quality  delivery of insufficient quantity of products  or the interruption or discontinuance of operations of a manufacturer  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
while we maintain strong relationships with 
table of contents our manufacturing partners  our agreements with these manufacturers are generally of limited duration and pricing  quality and volume commitments are negotiated on a recurring basis 
the failure to maintain continuing agreements with our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business 
we intend to introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require that we rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
as part of our cost reduction efforts  we will need to realize lower per unit product costs from our manufacturing partners by means of volume efficiencies and the utilization of manufacturing sites in lower cost geographies 
however  we cannot be certain when or if such price reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain such price reductions would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
our dependence on an oem for all of our wireless products could harm our operating results 
we rely on motorola to provide our wireless products 
if we experience delays in product shipments from our oem or if they experience delays from their suppliers  which in turn delays product shipments to our customers  our financial results could be negatively impacted 
problems such as delivery of products of inferior quality  delivery of insufficient quantity of products  or the interruption or discontinuance of operations of our oem  may arise in the future  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we depend upon international sales for a significant portion of our revenue which imposes a number of risks on our business 
international sales constitute a significant portion of our net revenue 
our ability to grow will depend in part on the expansion of international sales 
our international sales primarily depend on the success of our resellers and distributors 
the failure of these resellers and distributors to sell our products internationally would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenue 
there are a number of risks arising from our international business  including longer accounts receivable collection cycles  difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas  difficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  the payment of operating expenses in local currencies  which exposes us to risks of currency fluctuations  higher credit risks requiring cash in advance or letters of credit  difficulties in safeguarding intellectual property  political and economic turbulence  terrorism  war or other armed conflict  natural disasters and epidemics  potential adverse tax consequences  compliance with regulatory requirements of foreign countries  including compliance with rapidly evolving environmental regulations  and compliance with us laws and regulations pertaining to the sale and distribution of products to customers in foreign countries  including export controls and the foreign corrupt practices act 
substantially all of our international sales are us dollar denominated 
future increases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
in 
table of contents the future  we may elect to invoice some of our international customers in local currency  which would expose us to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the particular local currency 
if we do so  we may decide to engage in hedging transactions to minimize the risk of such fluctuations 
we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the impact of payment of operating expenses in local currencies to some of our operating foreign subsidiaries 
however  if we are not successful in managing these foreign currency transactions  we could incur losses from these activities 
we must continue to develop and increase the productivity of our indirect distribution channels to increase net revenue and improve our operating results 
our distribution strategy focuses primarily on developing and increasing the productivity of our indirect distribution channels 
if we fail to develop and cultivate relationships with significant channel partners  or if these channel partners are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results could suffer 
many of our channel partners also sell products from other vendors that compete with our products 
our channel partners may not continue to market or sell our products effectively or to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
we may not be able to successfully manage our sales channels or enter into additional reseller and or distribution agreements 
our failure to do any of these could limit our ability to grow or sustain revenue 
our operating results for any given period have and will continue to depend to a significant extent on large orders from a relatively small number of channel partners and other customers 
however  we do not have binding purchase commitments from any of them 
a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to a significant reseller  distributor or other customer could harm our business  operating results and financial condition because our expense levels are based on our expectations as to future revenue and to a large extent are fixed in the short term 
under specified conditions  some third party distributors are allowed to return products to us and unexpected returns could adversely affect our results 
the sales cycle for our products is long and we may incur substantial non recoverable expenses or devote significant resources to sales that do not occur when anticipated 
our products represent a significant strategic decision by a customer regarding its communications infrastructure 
the decision by customers to purchase our products is often based on the results of a variety of internal procedures associated with the evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of new technologies 
accordingly  the product evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle  typically ranging from three months to longer than a year  and as a result  our ability to sell products is subject to a number of significant risks  including risks that budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews by customers will result in the loss of potential sales  there may be substantial variation in the length of the sales cycle from customer to customer  making decisions on the expenditure of resources difficult to assess  we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management time in an attempt to initiate or increase the sale of products to customers  but not succeed  if a sales forecast from a specific customer for a particular quarter is not achieved in that quarter  we may be unable to compensate for the shortfall  which could harm our operating results  and downward pricing pressures could occur during the lengthy sales cycle for our products 

table of contents if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our goals 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  service and operations personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment contracts with these individuals who mandate that they render services for any specific term  nor do we carry life insurance on any of our key personnel 
we have experienced and may in the future experience significant turn over in our executive personnel 
in addition  retention has generally become more difficult for us  in part because the exercise price of most of the stock options granted to many of our employees is below the market price 
as a result  we experienced high levels of attrition 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing  service  finance and operations personnel 
the market for these personnel is competitive  especially in the san francisco bay area  and we have had difficulty in hiring employees  particularly engineers  in the timeframe we desire 
companies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we have from time to time been involved in claims like this with other companies and  although to date they have not resulted in material litigation  we do not know whether we will be involved in additional claims in the future 
we could incur substantial costs in litigating any such claims  regardless of the merits 
failure of our products to comply with evolving industry standards and complex government regulations may adversely impact our business 
if we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards and government regulations  we may not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply 
the network equipment industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid changes in technology and customers requirements and evolving industry standards 
as a result  our success depends on the timely adoption and market acceptance of industry standards  and timely resolution of conflicting us and international industry standards  and our ability to influence the development of emerging industry standards and to introduce new and enhanced products that are compatible with such standards 
in the past  we have introduced new products that were not compatible with certain technological standards  and in the future  we may not be able to effectively address the compatibility and interoperability issues that arise as a result of technological changes and evolving industry standards 
our products must also comply with various us federal government regulations and standards defined by agencies such as the federal communications commission  standards established by governmental authorities in various foreign countries and recommendations of the international telecommunication union 
in some circumstances  we must obtain regulatory approvals or certificates of compliance before we can offer or distribute our products in certain jurisdictions or to certain customers 
complying with new regulations or obtaining certifications can be costly and disruptive to our business 
for example  we expended significant resources and expenses in order to comply with the european union s directive ec waste electrical and electronic equipment and directive ec on restriction on the certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 
if we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards or government regulations  we will not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our net revenue or achieving profitability 

table of contents changes in effective tax rates including from the release of the valuation allowance recorded against our net us deferred tax assets  or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns or change in ownership  could adversely affect our results 
our future effective tax rates may be volatile or adversely affected by changes in our business or us or foreign tax laws  including the partial or full release of the valuation allowance recorded against our net us deferred tax assets  expiration of or lapses in the research and development tax credit laws  transfer pricing adjustments  tax effects of stock based compensation  or costs related to restructurings 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
although we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes  there is no assurance that such determinations by us are in fact adequate 
changes in our effective tax rates or amounts assessed upon examination of our tax returns may have a material  adverse impact on our cash flows and our financial condition 
our future effective tax rate in particular could be adversely affected by a change in ownership pursuant to us internal revenue code section if a change in ownership occurs  it may limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses to offset our us taxable income 
if us taxable income is greater than the change in ownership limitation  we will pay a higher rate of tax with respect to the amount of taxable income that exceeds the limitation 
this would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
on june   we amended our rights agreement to mitigate against the possibility of a section change in ownership with the objective of preserving our tax attributes 
if we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes  our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed 
our ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with regulations requires an effective planning and management process 
we need to continue improving our existing  and implement new  operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
any delay in the implementation of  or disruption in the transition to  new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could harm our ability to record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis  or to forecast future results 
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the sec  affect our nasdaq listing  and adversely affect our stock price 
the securities and exchange commission  as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on our internal control over financial reporting 
although we review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the section requirements  if our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented  designed  operated or reviewed  or if the independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements  rules and or regulations differently from our interpretation  then they may decline to attest to management s assessment or may issue an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting because of the existence of one or more material weaknesses 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which ultimately could negatively impact our stock price 
compliance with laws  rules and regulations relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
federal securities laws  rules and regulations  as well as nasdaq rules and regulations  require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures  impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements  set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members 
table of contents and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers  chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations 
these laws  rules and regulations and the interpretation of these requirements are evolving  and we are making investments to evaluate current practices and to continue to achieve compliance 
as a result  our compliance programs have increased and will continue to increase general and administrative expenses and have diverted and will continue to divert management time and attention from revenue generating activities 
our headquarters and some significant supporting businesses are located in northern california and other areas subject to natural disasters that could disrupt our operations and harm our business 
our corporate headquarters are located in silicon valley in northern california 
historically  this region has been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  fires and floods  which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our property 
we have contract manufacturers located in mexico and taiwan where similar natural disasters and other risks may disrupt the local economy and pose physical risks to our property and the property of our contract manufacturer 
in addition  the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruptions to the economies of the us and other countries 
if such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders for our products  our business and operating results will suffer 
we currently do not have redundant  multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster  terrorist act or other catastrophic event 
in the event of such an occurrence  our business would suffer 
failure to successfully expand our sales and support teams or educate them in regard to technologies and our product families may harm our operating results 
the sale of our products and services requires a concerted effort that is frequently targeted at several levels within a prospective customer s organization 
we may not be able to increase net revenue unless we expand our sales and support teams in order to address all of the customer requirements necessary to sell our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate employees into our company or to educate current and future employees in regard to rapidly evolving technologies and our product families 
a failure to do so may hurt our revenue growth and operating results 
we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders  cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities 
as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that we believe would complement our current product offerings  augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities  or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt  assume contingent liabilities  or expend significant cash 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or the price of our common stock 
moreover  even if we do obtain benefits in the form of increased sales and earnings  these benefits may be recognized much later than the time when the expenses associated with an acquisition are incurred 
this is particularly relevant in cases where it is necessary to integrate new types of technology into our existing portfolio 
table of contents and new types of products may be targeted for potential customers with which we do not have pre existing relationships 
acquisitions and investment activities also entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and or products  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment transaction  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  the potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations  and substantial charges for the amortization of certain purchased intangible assets  deferred stock compensation or similar items 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies  or personnel that we might acquire in the future  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may need additional capital to fund our future operations and  if it is not available when needed  our business will be adversely impacted 
we believe that our existing working capital and cash available from credit facilities and future operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  if cash from future operations is insufficient  or if cash is used for acquisitions or other currently unanticipated uses  we may need additional capital 
the development and marketing of new products and the expansion of reseller and distribution channels and associated support personnel requires a significant commitment of resources 
in addition  if the markets for our products develop more slowly than anticipated  or if we fail to establish significant market share and achieve sufficient net revenue  we may continue to consume significant amounts of capital 
as a result  we could be required to raise additional capital 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of the shares held by existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  such securities may provide the holders certain rights  preferences  and privileges senior to those of common stockholders  and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
we cannot assure you that additional capital  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
we have entered into long term lease agreements for several facilities that are currently vacant and may be difficult to sublease due to current real estate market conditions 
we have certain long term real estate lease commitments carrying future obligations for non cancelable lease payments 
reductions in our workforce and the restructuring of operations since fiscal have resulted in the need to consolidate certain of these leased facilities  located primarily in northern california  for which we recorded a reversal of excess facilities charges  net of approximately million in fiscal  million expense reversal  net in fiscal  million expense in fiscal  million expense in fiscal  and million expense in fiscal we may incur additional charges for excess facilities as a result of additional reductions in our workforce or future restructuring of operations 
we will continue to be responsible for all carrying costs of these facilities until such time as we can sublease these facilities or terminate the applicable leases based on the contractual terms of the lease agreements  and these costs may have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents our stock price has been volatile in the past and our stock price may significantly fluctuate in the future 
in the past  our common stock price has fluctuated significantly 
this could continue as we or our competitors announce new products  our results or those of our customers or competition fluctuate  conditions in the networking or semiconductor industry change  or when investors  change their sentiment toward stocks in the networking technology sector 
in addition  fluctuations in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may make our stock attractive to momentum  hedge or day trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stock rapidly  exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction  particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent an acquisition of extreme  which could decrease the value of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
although we believe these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law and our stockholder rights plan  which is described below  will provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders 
our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan  under which we declared and paid a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of may  under the plan  each right will entitle stockholders to purchase a fractional share of our preferred stock for 
each such fractional share of the new preferred stock has terms designed to make it substantially the economic equivalent of one share of common stock 
initially the rights will not be exercisable and will trade with our common stock 
generally  the rights may become exercisable if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer upon consummation of which such person or group would beneficially own or more of our common stock 
when the rights become exercisable  our board of directors has the right to authorize the issuance of one share of our common stock in exchange for each right that is then exercisable

item legal proceedings we may from time to time be party to litigation arising in the course of our business  including  without limitation  allegations relating to commercial transactions  business relationships or intellectual property rights

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we develop and sell network infrastructure equipment and offer related services contracts for extended warranty and maintenance to our enterprise  data center and metropolitan telecommunications service provider customers 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of our networking equipment and related service contracts 
in fiscal  our revenue decreased million  gross profit decreased million  operating profit decreased million and net income decreased million as compared to fiscal we believe that understanding the following key developments is helpful to an understanding of our operating results for fiscal supply chain constraints we use our forecast of expected demand to determine our material requirements 
lead times for materials and components we order vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  customer orders exceeded our forecast  especially with respect to certain products 
in addition  our contract manufacturers and their component suppliers had significantly reduced their capacity due to the world wide economic slowdown  and therefore lead times significantly increased during the first fiscal quarter across our supply chain as our contract manufacturers and their component suppliers struggled to meet increasing demands 
as a result  we were unable to deliver products based on customer requests 
this adversely affected our revenue and sales for the first quarter of fiscal since we were unable to deliver products in that quarter in a timely manner and certain customers cancelled orders or chose other vendors based on product availability 
we have made substantial progress with our suppliers to improve timely delivery of our products to meet customers demands in the second quarter through the fourth quarter of fiscal we continue to work to manage our forecast and supply chain in light of our customers demands as accurately as possible 
impact of the global economic developments in addition to issues with our supply chain  we believe that the credit market crisis  global recession and other challenges affecting global economic conditions were the significant drivers of our financial performance during fiscal sales in the united states and some european countries were most impacted as a result of the weak global economy and the global credit crisis in the financial market  while sales in asia were only minimally impacted by global economic developments and grew during the period 
we believe that limited access to credit  conservative purchasing patterns and delays or cancellation of it infrastructure plans in the face of continued uncertainty regarding the global economy  may continue to negatively impact overall demand for networking solutions  including ethernet equipment 
we have taken and plan to continue to take other steps to manage our business in the current economic environment 
for example  we have managed from time to time our contingent work force  scheduled shutdown weeks  reduced travel and other discretionary spending  and controlled all hiring activities 
increasing demand for bandwidth we believe that the continued increase in demand for bandwidth will over time drive future demand for high performance ethernet solutions 
wide spread adoption of electronic communications in all aspects of our lives  proliferation of next generation converged mobile devices and deployment of triple play services to residences and businesses alike  continues to generate demand for greater network performance across broader geographic locations 
in parallel to these transformational forces within society and the community at large  the accelerating adoption of internet and intranet cloud solutions within business enterprises is enabling organizations to offer greater business scalability to improve efficiency and through more effective operations  improve profitability 
in 
table of contents order to realize the benefits of these developments  customers require additional bandwidth and high performance from their network infrastructure at affordable prices 
as the economy continues its paced recovery  we are already seeing the initial indications that the ethernet segment of the networking equipment market will return to growth as enterprise  data center and carrier customers continue to recognize the performance and operating cost benefits of ethernet technology 
expanding product portfolio we believe that continued success in our marketplace is dependent upon a variety of factors that includes  but is not limited to  our ability to design  develop and distribute new and enhanced products employing leading edge technology 
during fiscal  we further extended our ethernet product portfolio through the addition of the summit x family of products targeted at data center customers  a further set of modules for the blackdiamond family and the next release of the extremexos modular operating system  release industry developments the market for network infrastructure equipment is highly competitive and dominated by a few large companies 
the difficult economic climate has further driven consolidation of vendors within the ethernet networking market and with vendors from adjacent markets  including storage  security  wireless and voice applications 
we believe that the underpinning technology for all of these adjacent markets is ethernet 
as a result  independent ethernet switch vendors are being acquired or merged with larger  adjacent market vendors to enable them to deliver complete and broad solutions 
as a result  we believe that  as an independent ethernet switch vendor  we must provide products that  when combined with the products of our large strategic partners  create compelling solutions for end user customers

adjustments to share based compensation expense during fiscal we were notified by our third party software provider that it had made certain changes to how its software program calculates stock based compensation expense 
specifically  the prior version of this software that we had been using calculated stock based compensation expense by incorrectly applying a weighted average forfeiture rate to the vested portion of stock option awards until the grant s final vest date  rather than calculating stock based compensation expense based upon the actual vested portion of the grant date fair value  resulting in an understatement of stock based compensation expense in certain periods prior to the grant s final vest date 
consequently  we identified errors in the calculation of stock based compensation expense for fiscal years ended june   july  and july  the errors identified relate only to the timing of stock based compensation expense recognition 
we determined that the cumulative error from the understatement of stock based compensation expense related to the periods discussed above totaled million through june  the impact of the errors on the fiscal years ended june   july  and july   is to decrease net income by million for each year 
management has determined that the impact of this error is not material to the previously issued annual and interim financial statements 
accordingly  the annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending june  include the cumulative adjustment to increase stock based compensation expense by million or per share to correct these errors 
we do not believe the correction of these errors is material to the annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending june  critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates  assumptions and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience  market trends and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe the critical accounting policies stated below  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents share based payments we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of option award and employee stock purchase plan espp on the date of grant with the weighted average assumptions 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected term of espp represents the contractual life of the espp purchase period 
the risk free rate based upon the estimated life of the option and espp is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
expected volatility is based on both the implied volatilities from traded options on our stock and historical volatility on our stock 
we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our expected dividend yield is zero 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
our estimated forfeiture rate in fiscal based on our historical forfeiture experience is approximately 
we modified our estimated forfeiture rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal and recognized the cumulative effect of the change  as a decrease in compensation expense  in that quarter of approximately million 
we use the straight line method for expense attribution  and we estimate forfeitures and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
revenue recognition we allocate revenue to each element of multiple element arrangements that include products containing software that is more than incidental using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements 
we determine vendor specific objective evidence of fair value based on the price charged when the item is sold separately 
under the residual method  we first allocate the revenue for a multiple element arrangement to the undelivered elements based on their vsoe of fair value  and the remainder of the arrangement fee to the delivered elements 
we derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our networking equipment  with the remaining revenue generated from service fees relating to the service contracts  professional services  and training on our products 
we generally recognize product revenue from our value added resellers  non stocking distributors and end user customers at the time of shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price of the product is fixed or determinable and collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured 
in instances where the criteria for revenue recognition are not met  revenue is deferred until all criteria have been met 
revenue from service obligations under service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual service period 
service contracts typically range from one to two years 
our total deferred product revenue was million and million as of june  and june   respectively 
our total deferred revenue for services  primarily from service contracts  was million as of june  and million as of june  service contracts typically range from one to two years 
shipping costs are included in cost of product revenues 
we make certain sales to partners in two distribution channels  or tiers 
the first tier consists of a limited number of independent distributors that sell primarily to resellers and  on occasion  to end user customers 
we defer recognition of revenue on all sales until the distributors sell the product  as evidenced by monthly sales out reports that the distributors provide to us 
we grant these distributors the right to return a portion of unsold inventory for the purpose of stock rotation 
we also grant these distributors certain price protection rights 
the distributor related deferred revenue and receivables are adjusted at the time of the stock rotation return or price reduction 
we also provide distributors with credits for changes in selling prices  and allow distributors to participate in cooperative marketing programs 
we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these exposures based upon our contractual obligations 
in connection with cooperative advertising programs  we do not meet the criteria in our accounting policy for recognizing the expenses as marketing expenses and accordingly  the costs are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 

table of contents the second tier of the distribution channel consists of a large number of third party value added resellers that sell directly to end users 
for product sales to value added resellers  we do not grant return privileges  except for defective products during the warranty period  nor do we grant pricing credits 
accordingly  we recognize revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the value added reseller  which is generally upon shipment 
we reduce product revenue for cooperative marketing activities that may occur under contractual arrangements that we have with our resellers 
we provide an allowance for sales returns based on our historical returns  analysis of credit memo data and our return policies 
the allowance for sales returns was million as of june  and june  for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable 
the provision for returns is charged to net revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  and was  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
if the historical data that we use to calculate the estimated sales returns and allowances does not properly reflect future levels of product returns  these estimates will be revised  thus resulting in an impact on future net revenue 
we estimate and adjust this allowance at each balance sheet date 
inventory valuation our inventory balance was million as of june   compared with million as of june  we value our inventory at lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
we provide inventory allowances based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts 
the allowance is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and charged to the provision for inventory  which is a component of cost of sales 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
any written down or obsolete inventory subsequently sold has not had a material impact on gross margin for any of the periods disclosed 
inventory write downs charged to cost of product revenue were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal accrued warranty networking products may contain undetected hardware or software errors when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are released to the marketplace 
in the past  we had experienced such errors in connection with products and product updates 
our standard hardware warranty period is typically months from the date of shipment to end users and days for software 
for certain access products  we offer a limited lifetime hardware warranty commencing on the date of shipment from us and ending five years following the our announcement of the end of sale of such product 
upon shipment of products to our customers  including both end users and channel partners  we estimate expenses for the cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty and accrue a liability through charges to cost of product revenue for this amount 
our accrued warranty balance was million as of june  and june  the determination of our warranty requirements is based on our actual historical experience with the product or product family  estimates of repair and replacement costs and any product warranty problems that are identified after shipment 
we estimate and adjust this accrual at each balance sheet date in accordance with changes in these factors 
in fiscal  we recorded million for a change in estimate resulting from losses identified related to a failure in one of our products  and recovered in a settlement all estimated costs related to this issue from our outside design manufacturer 
the cost of new warranties issued that was charged to cost of product revenue was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal 
table of contents accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million and million as of june  and june   respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts for trade accounts receivable as of june  was million  compared to million as of june  we continually monitor and evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for bad debts in general and administrative expense when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends in the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
we mitigate some collection risk by requiring most of our customers in the asia pacific region  excluding japan and australia  to pay cash in advance or secure letters of credit when placing an order with us 
our provision for doubtful accounts was an expense of  in fiscal  expense of million in fiscal and expense of million in fiscal deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we make an assessment of the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not believed to be likely  a valuation allowance is established 
we provided a full valuation allowance against all of our us federal and state net deferred tax assets in fiscal in the amount of million in accordance with our policy 
in fiscal  the valuation allowance increased by million to million  and in fiscal  the valuation allowance decreased by million to million 
we have not provided a valuation allowance against any of our non us deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period was given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our us losses during those periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our us federal and state net deferred tax assets 
this valuation allowance will be evaluated periodically and can be reversed partially or totally if business results have sufficiently improved to support realization of our deferred tax assets 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we had unrecognized tax benefits of million as of june  if fully recognized in the future  million would impact our effective tax rate  and million would result in adjustments to deferred tax assets and corresponding adjustments to the valuation allowance 
we do not anticipate any material changes to our uncertain tax positions during the next twelve months 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings  including negotiations regarding potential licenses from third parties who have notified us that they believe our products may infringe certain patents 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter  whether litigation or licensing negotiation  and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals  if any  are based only on the most current and dependable information available at any given time 
as additional information becomes available  we may reassess the potential liability from pending claims and litigation and the probability of claims being successfully asserted against us 
as a result  we 
table of contents may revise our estimates related to these pending claims and litigation 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows in the future

historically  these securities provided liquidity to investors through their interest rate reset feature ie  interest rates on these securities are reset through a bidding process or auction at frequent  pre determined intervals typically every to days 
at each reset  investors could either rollover and maintain their holdings or liquidate them at par value 
since february  auctions related to our ars have failed as a result of the deterioration of the credit markets  rendering these securities illiquid 
on november   we accepted an offer the ubs rights offer from ubs ag ubs  providing us with certain rights related to our ars the rights 
the rights permit us to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value  which is defined as the price equal to the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  at any time during the period of june  through july  conversely  ubs has the right  in its discretion  to purchase or sell our ars at any time until july   so long as we receive payment at par value upon any sale or disposition 
as of june   ubs exercised its rights to call back the ars at par for million and issuers redeemed million of ars at par 
on june   we sold the remaining ars balance of million at par under the rights 
on july   we received million plus accrued interest in cash from ubs for the ars settlement 
in october  we entered into a secured line of credit with ubs  collateralized by our ars held by ubs 
the maximum amount of credit available under this line of credit is million 
when we accepted the ubs rights offer in november  the terms of the ubs no net cost loan program were applied to this line of credit 
under this program  the interest rate on this secured credit facility will be equivalent to the interest rate earned by us on the ars  resulting in no net interest cost to us 
as of june   there was no outstanding borrowing under this line of credit 
on june   we exercised our ubs rights to redeem the remaining ars at par 
upon exercising the ubs rights  this line of credit was terminated 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and cash available from credit facilities and future operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued a new accounting standards update for fair value measurements and disclosures 
a reporting entity should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of 
table of contents level and level and describe the reasons for the transfers 
a reporting entity should separately disclose information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements for level reconciliation disclosures 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for financial statements issued interim or annual financial periods ending after december   with the exception for the reconciliation disclosures for level  which are effective for financial statements issued interim or annual financial periods ending after december  the adoption of the new accounting standards update did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or financial disclosures

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  other non government debt securities and money market funds 
as of june   we held a variety of interest bearing ars that represent investments in pools of student loans 
these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our holdings in ars investments and auctions for our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
on november   we accepted the ubs rights offer from ubs  providing us with rights related to our ars 
the rights permit us to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value  which is defined as the price equal to the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  at any time during the period of june  through july  conversely  ubs has the right  in its discretion  to purchase or sell our ars at any time until july   so long as we receive payment at par value upon any sale or disposition 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we reclassified our entire balance of ars from marketable securities to short term securities in our consolidated balance sheet 
the reclassification is a result of the put option being due within less than one year from the balance sheet date 
beginning in  we began to sell our ars under the rights 
as of june   ubs exercised its rights to call back the ars at par for million and issuers redeemed million of ars at par 
on june   we sold the remaining ars balance of million at par under the rights 
on july   we received million plus accrued interest in cash from ubs for the ars settlement 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact its valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities  discount rates and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  we may be required to record impairment charges in future quarters 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of june  and june  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are generally not subject to market risk 
included within short term investments as of june  within this table is our ars portfolio held at ubs 
maturing in three months or less three months to one year greater than one year total fair value in thousands june  included in short term investments weighted average interest rate included in marketable securities weighted average interest rate 
table of contents maturing in three months or less three months to one year greater than one year total fair value in thousands june  included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rate included in marketable securities weighted average interest rate we accumulate unrealized gains and losses on our available for sale debt securities  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of its balance sheets 
such an unrealized gain or loss does not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period 
if the fair value of an available for sale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis  an other than temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where we intend to sell the instrument  it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument that is  a credit loss exists 
if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the available for sale debt instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis  we recognize an other than temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments amortized cost basis and its fair value 
for available for sale debt instruments that are considered other than temporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss  if we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors 
the credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between the debt instrument s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows 
the remaining difference between the debt instrument s fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive income loss 
exchange rate sensitivity currently  substantially all of our sales and the majority of our expenses are denominated in united states dollars and  as a result  we have experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
while we conduct some sales transactions and incur certain operating expenses in foreign currencies and expect to continue to do so  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant  in part because of our foreign exchange risk management process discussed below 
foreign exchange forward contracts we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings as other income expense 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of gains and losses generated by the foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain operating expenses and remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in japanese yen  the euro  the swedish krona  the indian rupee and the british pound 
these derivatives do not qualify as hedges 
at june   these forward foreign currency contracts had a notional principal amount of million and fair value was million 
these contracts have maturities of less than days 
changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange forward contracts are offset largely by remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses from operations were a loss of million in fiscal  a loss of million in fiscal and a loss of million in fiscal
