overview sciclone pharmaceuticals nasdaq scln is a profit focused  global specialty pharmaceutical company with a substantial international business  based primarily in the people s republic of china china  and with a product portfolio of novel therapies for cancer and infectious diseases 
our strategy is focused on international sales growth  a cost containing clinical development strategy  and overall expense management 
zadaxin  our brand of thymalfasin or thymosin alpha and our primary product  is sold in over countries for the treatment of the hepatitis b virus hbv and the hepatitis c virus hcv  certain cancers and as a vaccine adjuvant 
we believe our current cash and investment position and the gross profit from our product sales provide the financial resources to execute on our strategy for continued growth in our international business and for development of our pipeline of late stage product candidates 
we plan to expand our commercial operations  currently located primarily in china  with the goal of becoming a significant pharmaceutical company in china s rapidly growing pharmaceutical market 
a key part of our strategy is to leverage our decade of experience in china and to grow our international business by adding commercial stage or near term commercial stage products to our portfolio 
we believe we are well positioned to in license additional therapeutics for our international business with a focus on china  in part because of our opportunity to commercialize these products utilizing our well established sales and marketing organization in china 
furthermore  our international growth strategy may include additional partnerships and merger and acquisition transactions for products 
we have successfully in licensed two products that are part of this international commercial growth strategy  dc bead tm and ondansetron rapidfilm tm 
our dc bead product candidate is a novel treatment for advanced liver cancer which is currently approved in countries worldwide  including europe and the us we have commercialization rights for this product in china 
we commenced a small local registration trial in the first quarter of  which is expected to enroll approximately advanced liver cancer patients at three sfda certified liver cancer treatment centers 
the primary endpoint is safety and the secondary endpoint is efficacy  as measured by tumor response 
if the trial results are positive  we believe we may receive regulatory approval for dc bead by the end of our second in licensed product candidate as part of this international commercial growth strategy  is ondansetron rapidfilm 
we have commercialization rights for this product candidate in china and vietnam 
ondansetron rapidfilm  currently being evaluated for regulatory approval in europe  is an oral thin film formulation of ondansetron  a serotonin ht receptor antagonist commonly used to treat and prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy  radiotherapy and surgery 
we plan to file for product registration with the state food and drug administration of china sfda in we believe we may receive regulatory approval in china in our clinical development strategy is focused on our portfolio of novel product candidates for cancer and infectious diseases and includes scv and thymalfasin 
scv is being developed for the delay of onset of severe oral mucositis in patients receiving chemoradiation therapy for the treatment of cancers of the head and neck and for the treatment of hcv 
thymalfasin is being developed in an ongoing clinical trial for enhancement of influenza hn vaccination in immuno compromised patient populations  and for stage iv melanoma 

table of contents as part of this clinical development strategy  we are moving forward our clinical development program for scv  a small molecule synthetic peptide with immunomodulating properties  which is being studied in two indications oral mucositis and hcv 
we are currently conducting a phase multicenter  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  dose ranging study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of scv for the delay of onset of severe oral mucositis in subjects receiving chemoradiation therapy for the treatment of cancers of the head and neck 
the primary efficacy endpoint is delay of onset and severity of severe oral mucositis 
we completed enrollment of this trial in the second half of and expect to report results in the first quarter of the second component of the scv clinical development project is for the treatment of hcv 
this multicenter  multidose  open label study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunomodulatory effects of scv as a monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin in non cirrhotic patients with genotype chronic hcv who have relapsed after at least weeks of treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin 
we expect to report results by the end of during our previous phase a clinical trial of scv designed to evaluate the effect of scv on hcv viral load  as well as on other measures of immune response  scv demonstrated activity in some treated patients in the higher dosage groups  and the decrease in viral load in these patients was accompanied by an increase in a biomarker which is usually correlated with an immunological response against hcv 
additionally  scv was shown to be generally safe and well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities or serious adverse events reported 
we continue to seek development opportunities with zadaxin thymalfasin focused on vaccine enhancement and melanoma 
in the fourth quarter of  our partner sigma tau finanziaria  spa sigma tau initiated a study in italy to evaluate zadaxin s thymalfasin ability to enhance immune response to the mf adjuvanted hn influenza monovalent vaccine  focetria from novartis 
the study  being conducted in hemodialysis patients reached full enrollment after two days  and in early  we reported promising preliminary results from this study regarding zadaxin s ability to enhance response to hn vaccine 
zadaxin is currently approved in italy and more than other countries as an enhancer for the influenza vaccine in immune compromised patients 
in addition  we continue to seek a partner for a phase trial to evaluate thymalfasin for use as a therapy for stage iv melanoma  but we do not intend to proceed with the trial unless we reach agreement with a partner 
sciclone s clinical development strategy is to focus on driving cost efficient phase and development of promising compounds while seeking development partners for costly phase trials  allowing us to achieve the potential upside of our portfolio of drug candidates 
we believe our cash and investments as of december  and ongoing revenue generating business operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next months 
our results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and we may report quarterly losses in the future 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates general we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united sates  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and 
table of contents expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the relevance of our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of delivery 
there are no significant customer acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on our part  except for sales to a new market where acceptance requirements have to be met 
sales to importing agents or distributors are recognized at time of shipment when title to the product is transferred to them 
importing agents or distributors do not have contractual rights of return except under limited terms regarding product quality 
however  we are expected to replace products that have expired or are deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered 
we estimate expected returns primarily on historical patterns 
historically  we have had no product returns of damaged  defective or expired product 
as such  no amount was accrued for product returns as of december  and in the respective consolidated balance sheets 
payments by the importing agents and distributors are not contingent upon sale to the end user by the importing agents or distributors 
amounts invoiced relating to arrangements where collectibility is uncertain and revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized as the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
cash equivalents and investments we record investments at fair value  as determined by available information on the consolidated balance sheet date 
an investment is considered impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost 
if  after consideration of all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of its investment  impairment is determined to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
fair value of financial instruments we record our financial assets including cash equivalents and accrued liabilities at cost  which approximates fair value due to their short term nature 
investments in marketable securities and our put option are recorded at their estimated fair value 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the three levels of input are level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
where quoted prices are available in an active market  we determine fair value based upon quoted market prices  and classify these values in level of the valuation hierarchy 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based upon observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities and are classified in level of the valuation hierarchy 

table of contents when quoted prices and observable inputs are unavailable  fair values are based on internally developed cash flow models and are classified in level of the valuation hierarchy 
the internally developed cash flow models primarily use  as inputs  estimates for interest rates and discount rates including yields of comparable traded instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors  amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the assets 
these inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets including assumptions about risk developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment  and may affect the valuation of the assets being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments  when appropriate 
we record our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of various factors 
when estimating the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider historical payment patterns of our customers  the circumstances of each individual customer and their geographic region including a review of the local economic environment  the age of the accounts receivable balances  credit quality of our customers  and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay 
at december   no allowance for doubtful accounts was considered necessary 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis and include amounts related to materials  labor and overhead 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current inventory levels 
if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels and demand were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may be required which could negatively impact our gross margins and results of operations 
if obsolete items are observed and there are no alternate uses for the inventory  we will record a write down to net realizable value in the period that the impairment is first recognized 
accrued expenses we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations and investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional services 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with selected service providers and make adjustments  if necessary 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on estimates of work performed or the level of patient enrollment and activities according to the protocols and agreements 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under certain contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses to the actual services received and efforts expended 
we monitor planned protocols  work performed  patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible and adjust estimates accordingly 
stock based compensation stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the fair value of the award using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably as the awards vest over the requisite service period  which is generally one or four years 
we value certain target stock price based options using the 
table of contents monte carlo simulation options pricing model and recognize expense over the service periods for each of the vesting portions of these awards which are six or eight years 
the option pricing models require the use of certain subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of the market price of the underlying stock and the expected term of the award 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
expected term is derived from historical data on employee exercises and terminations  or the contractual life of the award for target stock price based options 
we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  valuation assumptions used to value stock based compensation of awards granted in future periods may change 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  our deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
the tax years remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject 
results of operations product sales were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and our revenue growth was attributable to a higher volume of zadaxin due to further market penetration in china and modest price increases from the to periods 
for the year ended december   we believe there was also increased demand for zadaxin as a result of the hn flu virus 
sales to customers in china are denominated in us dollars and accounted for approximately   and of product sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  shanghai lingyun and china national pharmaceutical foreign trade corporation accounted for and of our sales  respectively  and two others importer accounted for of our sales 
in  shanghai lingyun and china national pharmaceutical foreign trade corporation accounted for and of our sales  respectively  and one other importer accounted for of our sales 
in  shanghai lingyun and china national pharmaceutical foreign trade corporation accounted for and of our sales  respectively  and one other importer accounted for of our sales 
no other customers accounted for more than of sales in those periods 
as of december   approximately million or of our accounts receivable were attributable to four customers in china 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  and generally do not require collateral from our customers 
gross margin was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin for the year ended december   compared to the years ended december  and  was attributable to higher sales of zadaxin resulting in volume discounts and lower per vial production costs  and was also attributable to lower royalty expense in the period 
in addition  we recorded a charge of  associated with our finished goods inventory related to vials made obsolete due to labeling requirements arising from our renewed import license in no significant charges were recorded by us associated with our product inventory during the year ended december  we estimate that our future cost of product sales will increase for the year ending december  in relation to an expected increase in the level of zadaxin sales 
we expect cost of product sales and hence gross margin to vary from year to year  depending upon the level of zadaxin sales  the absorption of product related fixed costs  and any charges associated with excess or expiring finished product inventory 
research and development r d expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease of million  or  in r d expenses for the year ended december   compared to the corresponding period of  was primarily 
table of contents related to the discontinuation of our rp clinical trial that occurred in the year ended december   offset partially by increased expense related to our scv phase clinical trials for the treatment of oral mucositis and hcv 
further  we made a million milestone payment upon first patient dosing in the rp phase clinical trial that occurred during the year ended december   and there was no corresponding payment in these decreases were partially offset by a million license fee payment related to our licensing agreement with apr applied pharma research sa apr that occurred during the year ended december  the increase of million  or  in r d expenses for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   related to our phase clinical trials for rp and scv  and to the development planning for a late stage clinical trial for melanoma 
the increase included approximately million for clinical trial management  statistical services and investigator expenses  an increase of approximately million for drug development and manufacturing costs related to the scale up for rp and purchase of gemcitabine for the rp clinical trial  and manufacturing of scv and ribavirin for the scv clinical trial  a million milestone payment upon first patient dosing in the rp phase clinical trial  an increase in compensation and benefits expense and recruiting fees due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel  and an increase in consulting and travel expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million of acquisition and legal costs related to the acquisition of exclusive rights for the united states and canada to develop and commercialize rp recorded during the year ended december  the major components of r d expenses include salaries and other personnel related expenses  including associated stock based compensation  facility related expenses  depreciation of facilities and equipment  license related fees  services performed by clinical research organizations and research institutions and other outside service providers  and the sharing of certain costs for the development of zadaxin by our partner  sigma tau 
the initiation and continuation of our current clinical development programs has had and is expected to continue to have a significant effect on our research and development expenses 
although it is not possible to determine the total cost expected to be incurred in any particular year for each clinical trial due to the uncertain nature of the clinical trial process  we expect that our future costs for the year ending december  relating to research and development of our programs will decrease primarily due to the discontinuation of our rp phase clinical trial which we announced in october  and the conclusion of our scv phase trial for the treatment of oral mucositis for which we expect to report results in the first quarter of  partially offset by our ongoing phase clinical trial for scv for the treatment of hcv 
the actual costs incurred in future periods will vary depending in particular upon timeline and design for further clinical trials and final decisions regarding the timing and expense sharing arrangements for these trials 
an expansion or significant extension of our clinical development programs may require us to seek additional capital resources 
we are evaluating opportunities to acquire or in license the marketing rights to proprietary products in china  which may result in increased research and development expenses due to license fee payments or other expenses related to in licensing a new product in the future 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses of million or for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to an increase of million in conference and seminar expenses  an increase of million in compensation and benefits expense as a result of increased bonus and sales incentives and an increase in the number of sales personnel  and an increase of million in rent and business tax expense  all related to our expanding sales efforts 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses of million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to an increase of million in conferences and medical education seminar expenses  an increase of million in salesforce incentives  an increase of million in compensation and benefits expense due to an increase in the number of 
table of contents sales personnel  and an increase of million in travel and entertainment expenses  all related to our expanding sales and marketing efforts 
we expect sales and marketing expenses for the year ending december  to be higher than those incurred for the year ended december  due to increased sales efforts  primarily in china 
general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during the year ended december   general and administrative expenses decreased  or compared to the year ended december  although we incurred increased expenses related to business development efforts in china  the increases were offset by decreased accounting and legal fees 
general and administrative expenses increased million or for the year december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in severance costs of approximately million related to the departure of a former officer  an increase in accounting and professional fees of approximately million  an increase in legal fees of approximately million  an increase in employment recruiting costs of approximately million  and a net increase in compensation and benefits related expenses due to an increase in headcount for the year ended december   offset partially by a decrease in stock based compensation expense 
we expect general and administrative expenses for the year ending december  will be comparable to general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  interest and investment income was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease for the year ended december  compared to the years ended december  and  resulted from lower cash and investments balances and lower returns due to a declining interest rate environment in the and periods 
interest and investment expense was million   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense for the year ended december   compared to the years ended december  and  resulted from the amortization of loan origination fees related to our silicon valley bank line of credit that was established in november provision for income tax of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  relates to our foreign operations in china 
the increases resulted from an increase in operating activities in china and an increase in the statutory tax rate in china from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  we expect the provision for income tax to increase for the year ending december   compared to the year ended december   due to increased operating activities in china and an increased statutory tax rate in china of in income taxes we have not recorded any us federal or state income tax expense for the years ended december    and undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately million at december  these earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested and accordingly  no deferred us income taxes have been provided thereon 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that expire in the years through the difference between the cumulative losses for financial reporting purposes and federal income tax purposes is primarily attributable to losses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries 
at december   we had federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately million that expire in the years through because of the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code  a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods 
as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future income tax liabilities 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources days sales outstanding in accounts receivable  using the average receivables method  were   and days in   and  respectively 
the majority of our sales are to customers in china where our accounts receivable collections have standard credit terms ranging from to days 
during the fourth quarter of  our largest customer in china agreed to payment terms of days instead of days in order to procure from us increased volume of zadaxin and a volume discount 
this change resulted in a reduction in our days sales outstanding in and compared to we believe that the day credit terms with our largest customer in china will continue into the foreseeable future 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash and investments  including million and million  respectively  of ars recorded at fair value as trading securities 
the ars are investments with contractual maturities generally between years whose underlying assets are student loans that are substantially backed by the federal government with interest rates resetting approximately every days through an auction process 
at the end of each reset period  investors may sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
disruptions in the credit markets have adversely affected the market for ars 
however  we do not believe that the underlying securities or collateral have been permanently affected and we continue to earn interest on our ars 
in november  we accepted an auction rate securities rights offer the rights offer from ubs ag under which  in return for a general release of claims and the grant of a right to ubs ag to purchase our ars at any time for full par value  we received the right to require ubs ag to purchase at par value our ars beginning in june the rights 
the rights are non transferable 
upon acceptance  we granted ubs ag the sole discretion and right to sell or dispose of  and or enter orders in the auction process with respect to the eligible ars on our behalf without prior notification to us from ubs ag  as long as we receive a payment at par upon any sale or disposition 
we expect to sell our ars under the rights 
however  if the rights are not exercised before july   they will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy our ars 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and primarily reflected the net income loss for the period  adjusted for non cash items such as stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization expense and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
for the year ended december   such changes included a million increase in accounts receivable  compared to the year ended december  related to increased sales and a reduction in payment terms that occurred at the end of fiscal with our largest customer in china from days to days 
in addition  inventory levels increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  to meet expected sales demands

these consist of purchase obligations with manufacturers 
this amount represents a discretionary accrued bonus payable to our chief executive officer as of december  based on the achievement of performance targets over the years in november  sciclone and its subsidiaries  spil and spil china as borrowers  entered into a loan and security agreement and an unconditional guaranty and security agreement with silicon valley bank the credit facility 
the credit facility is a line of credit that permits borrowing up to million for a term of months  subject to certain sublimits  including million for letters of credit 
the credit facility is secured by a first priority secured interest in all of our assets  other than intellectual property 
the credit facility also requires us to obtain a credit insurance policy insuring certain foreign account receivable assets 
sciclone pharmaceuticals  inc  as the parent of spil and spil china  is the guarantor of the credit facility 
the credit facility expires in november  and upon termination all amounts borrowed must be repaid in full 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility

we are also required to meet certain operating covenants that limit our ability to incur liabilities  create liens  make capital expenditures  pay dividends or distributions  make investments  and dispose of assets and to carry credit insurance 
in november  we received a limited waiver to the credit facility to waive certain minimum fees and interest payments  and to waive the requirement to maintain a credit insurance policy 
we are currently in compliance with the credit facility after giving effect to the limited waiver 
in may  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec under which we may offer and sell up to million of our securities  plus an additional million that we could sell under an immediately effective related registration statement  assuming we continue to meet the sec s eligibility requirements for primary offerings on form s we believe that our existing cash and investments and ongoing revenue generating business operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next months 
we have no current commitments to offer and sell any securities that may be offered or sold pursuant to our registration statement 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we would be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies  product candidates or marketing territories 
additional financing or collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available when needed either at all or  on favorable terms 
we intend to continue to explore alternatives for financing to provide additional flexibility in managing our operations  in licensing or acquiring new products  particularly in china  and funding our clinical trials 
the 
table of contents unavailability or the inopportune timing of any financing could prevent or delay our long term product development and commercialization programs  either of which could hurt our business 
we cannot assure you that funds from financings will be sufficient to conduct and complete further clinical trials or to acquire or in license additional products 
the need  timing and amount of any such financing would depend upon numerous factors  including the level of zadaxin sales  the timing and amount of manufacturing costs related to zadaxin  the availability of complementary products  technologies and businesses  the initiation and continuation of preclinical and clinical trials and testing  the timing of regulatory approvals  developments in relationships with existing or future collaborative parties  the status of competitive products  and various alternatives for financing

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in money market funds  certificates of deposit  term deposits  us treasury  or government agency notes 
in the past  we also invested in highly rated  auction rate securities 
the auction rate securities are classified as trading securities as of december   and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with realized gains or losses reported as income loss 
all of our investments mature within one year from date of purchase except for our auction rate securities  which we have the right to sell at par value  at our sole discretion  anytime during the period from june  through july   and our italian state bonds which mature in our investment securities may be subject to interest rate risk and could decrease in value if market interest rates rise 
to minimize this risk  we primarily hold securities that are short term in duration and maintain an average maturity of less than one year 
we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant and a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact to the total value of our investment portfolio at december  we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
we determined the fair market values of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs level and level inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs level inputs when measuring fair value 
we categorized our million par value ars as level in short term investments due to the failures in the markets to provide quoted market prices for the ars securities as well as the lack of any correlation to these instruments to other observable market data 
we valued these securities using a pricing model 
significant inputs that went into the model were the credit quality of the issuer  the percentage and types of guarantees such as federal family education loan program ffelp  
table of contents the probability of the auction succeeding or the security being called  an illiquidity discount factor  and tax status 
at december   the ars were recorded at their determined fair value of million and the loss of million had been realized in our financial statements 
changes in the assumptions of the model based on dynamic market conditions could have a significant impact on the valuation of these securities  which may lead us in the future to take further losses or gains for these securities 
we have recorded our put option at its fair value of million in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  we estimate the fair value of the put option based on a discounted cash flow model 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  estimates for discount rates using yields of comparable traded instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other risk factors  and amount of cash flows for the expected holding period 
these inputs reflect our assumptions about risk  developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
changes in the assumptions of the model based on dynamic market conditions could have a significant impact on the valuation of this asset  which may lead us in the future to record gains or losses for this asset 
substantially all our sales and most of our manufacturing costs to date have been in us dollars 
however  some of our purchases with contract manufacturers are denominated in euros and costs of our marketing efforts in china are paid in local currency 
in addition  we have certain cash balances denominated in euros 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations  and we do not hedge against the risk associated with such fluctuations 
consequently  changes in exchange rates could result in material exchange losses and could unpredictably  materially and adversely affect our operating results and stock price 
such losses have been insignificant to date
