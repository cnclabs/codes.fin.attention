in the md a  net interest income  net interest margin  and the efficiency ratio are presented on an fte basis and the quarterly ratios are presented on an annualized basis 
the fte basis adjusts for the tax favored status of income from certain loans and investments 
we believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources 
we also present diluted earnings per common share excluding goodwill and intangible impairment charges 
we believe the exclusion of the impairment charges is more reflective of normalized operations and allows better comparability with peers throughout the industry 
additionally  we present a return on average realized common shareholders equity  as well as an roe 
we also present a roa less net realized and unrealized securities gains losses and an roa 
the return on average realized common shareholders equity and roa less net realized and unrealized securities gains losses exclude realized securities gains and losses and the coke dividend  from the numerator  and net unrealized securities gains from the denominator 
we present a tangible efficiency ratio and a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio  which excludes the effect of intangible assets costs 
we believe these measures are useful to investors because  by removing the effect of intangible asset costs the level of which may vary from company to company  it allows investors to more easily compare our efficiency and capital adequacy to other companies in the industry 
we also present a tangible book value per common share ratio which excludes the after tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets 
these measures are utilized by management to assess our financial performance and capital adequacy

within our geographic footprint  we operate under four business segments retail and commercial  corporate and investment banking  household lending  and wealth and investment management  with the remainder in corporate other and treasury

executive overview while many economists have declared the recession to be over or at least abating by the end of  the economic environment during adversely impacted our financial performance and will likely continue to impact our performance into  particularly related to credit which tends to lag economic cycles 
we recognize that the beginning of a recovery is just that  a beginning  and history tells us that  looking over the long term  it will take time before economic stabilization meaningfully translates into bottom line results for traditional banks 
asset quality  revenues and ultimately earnings improvement will need time to gain traction and the timing will be largely dependent upon the strength and sustainability of the economic recovery  both of which remain uncertain at the end of regardless of when economists determine the end of the recession  the economy remains weak  as evidenced by many key economic indicators 
notably  the national unemployment rate rose steadily during the year to finish at as of december  which is up from a high of at the end of more specifically  the unemployment rate exceeds within many of our markets 
furthermore  it is believed that the national unemployment rate will remain elevated during much of additionally  home prices remain depressed and continued to decline throughout the year in some of our more significant markets 

table of contents the federal reserve  the fdic  and us government undertook steps during the year to strengthen the capital of financial institutions  stimulate lending  and inject liquidity into the financial markets 
among the steps taken by the government agencies  the tlgp was extended into late  billions of mbs were purchased in the open market  trillions of debt obligations were issued  and benchmark interest rates were kept at record low levels throughout the year 
as came to a close  the us government and bank regulators were discussing how to reduce their involvement as a financial intermediary in the markets due to the markets having exhibited some signs of stability 
most notably  the government is assessing when to discontinue some of its support programs including its ongoing purchases of mortgage backed assets 
this reduction in support could cause mortgage interest rates to rise which would result in a potential reduction in mortgage originations  decrease in value of mortgage loans and securities  and an overall slowing of the housing market 
concurrently  the financial services industry is entering a new phase in its relationship with regulatory authorities as the regulators debate new regulations and requirements that would affect our business  some in a negative way 
see additional discussion of risks associated with potential new regulations in item  business  under the heading government supervision and regulation and item a  risk factors in this k 
during  the federal bank regulatory agencies completed a review  called the scap  commonly referred to as the stress test  of the capital needs through the end of of the nineteen largest us bank holding companies 
the federal reserve announced the results of the scap on may  the federal reserve advised us that  based on the scap review  we presently have and are projected to continue to have tier capital well in excess of the amount required to be well capitalized through the forecast period under both the baseline scenario and the more adverse than expected scenario more adverse as estimated by the us treasury 
the scap s more adverse scenario represents a hypothetical scenario that involves a recession that is longer and more severe than consensus expectations and results in higher than expected credit losses  but is not a forecast of expected losses or revenues 
the federal reserve advised us that based on the more adverse scenario that it required us to adjust the composition of our tier capital by increasing the tier common equity portion by billion 
the common equity increase prescribed by the federal reserve is necessary to maintain tier common equity at of risk weighted assets under the more adverse scenario  as specified by a new regulatory standard that was introduced as part of the stress test 
this increase satisfied the regulatory request that we have an increased mix of common equity as a percentage of tier capital  to serve as a buffer against higher losses than generally expected  and allow us to remain well capitalized and able to lend to creditworthy borrowers should such losses materialize 
our actual credit losses were significantly less than the projections utilized in the scap process 
during the second quarter  in response to the scap  we successfully completed our capital plan and initiatives  generating billion of capital and exceeding the target of billion established by the federal reserve 
the transactions utilized to raise the capital included the issuance of common stock  the repurchase of certain preferred stock and hybrid debt securities  and the sale of visa class b shares 
these capital raising transactions increased tier common equity by billion and were the driving factor in the increase in our tier common equity ratio to at december  compared to at december  during the second quarter  we completed all required capital initiatives and believe that relative to the more adverse scenario  additional capital will be achieved through lower credit losses than projected by scap 
as a result of the successful capital plan and initiatives  we have the ability and desire to repay the us government for funds borrowed in the form of preferred stock issued by us under the cpp 
however  our repayment of tarp funds is predicated on approval by our primary regulator  the federal reserve 
see additional discussion of scap and the capital plan and initiatives in the capital resources section of this md a 
despite the challenging economic environment  we continue to operate from a position of strength and are focused on growing revenue  improving expense efficiency  increasing the profitability of the balance sheet  investing for the future  and prudently managing credit 
to this end  we remain acutely focused on clients  improving service quality and front line execution  controlling expenses  and managing risk 
during the year  revenue was soft  loan demand was down  credit costs were higher  and asset quality was weak 
we are seeing sustained economic weakness that has reduced demand for loans as clients have focused on capital preservation and debt reduction  while accessing the debt markets in lieu of bank loans 
however  we have also experienced positive operating trends in many of our businesses that included strong deposit growth  improved funding mix  significant expansion of net interest margin  positive fee income growth in certain areas  continued strong expense management  and credit trends that improved during the last half of specifically  in the last quarter of  we experienced declining net charge offs and early stage delinquencies  stabilizing nonperforming loans  and a lesser increase in the alll 
we believe our strong foundation coupled with our client focused execution  risk mitigation capabilities  and the long term economic prospects of our markets position us to deliver improving financial performance as the operating environment improves 
the difficult economic environment during negatively impacted our financial performance as we realized a net loss available to common shareholders of billion  or per common share 
the net loss during the year was primarily a result of goodwill impairment taken during the first quarter and increased provisioning for credit losses during the year 
the first quarter non cash goodwill impairment charge attributable to common shareholders was million  after tax  or per common share  while the provision for credit losses increased by million  after tax  or per common share 

table of contents while was a year of poor credit performance as most notably evidenced by our higher allowance for loan losses  provision for credit losses  net charge offs  and nonperforming assets  asset quality trends improved in the final quarter of when compared to the previous quarter as evidenced by the decline in credit losses and early stage delinquencies and stabilization of nonperforming loans 
in addition  our reserve build decreased during each consecutive quarter during the year with the fourth quarter allowance for loan losses having increased by only from the prior quarter 
however  absolute asset quality issues remain centered in the residential real estate related portfolios  including residential mortgages  home equity products  and residential construction 
in addition  we experienced some weakness in our commercial client base  particularly those in more cyclically sensitive industries  and in our small business portfolio  and we expect that we will continue to see stress in asset quality in the commercial portfolio 
the billion increase in net charge offs during the year was primarily related to residential mortgages  large corporate borrowers in economically cyclical industries  and the resolution of loan workouts related to the home builder portfolio 
our nonperforming loans grew by billion during  which is a result of the economic environment causing increased client defaults on their loans and extended disposition times on our consumer loans secured by residential real estate 
given the extended timelines to foreclose  especially in florida  we expect that our nonperforming loan levels will remain elevated throughout however  during the second half of  the level of increases in nonperforming loans moderated as compared to the increases seen during the first six months of the year 
this moderation in nonperforming loans  the first since the credit crisis began in  was mainly due to a reduction in nonaccrual commercial loans as the result of charge offs recognized during the second half of the year and the transfer of certain commercial loans out of nonaccrual due to improved performance 
we have implemented numerous loss mitigation efforts and are working to effectively manage elevated levels of nonperforming loans 
while not a primary driver of the improvement  our proactive mortgage loan modification programs have had a positive influence on these delinquency and nonperforming loan trends 
we have seen a billion increase in accruing restructured loans during  which is due to us taking proactive steps to responsibly modify loans in order to mitigate loss exposure related to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty 
we are aggressively pursuing modifications when there is a reasonable chance that the modification will allow the client to continue to remain in their home 
although  when there has been a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support even a modified loan  we are strongly encouraging short sales and deed in lieu arrangements and relocation to more affordable housing 
see additional discussion of credit and asset quality in the loans  allowance for credit losses  provision for credit losses  and nonperforming assets sections of this md a 
despite the net losses in  our capital and liquidity positions are stronger at the end of compared to prior year as evidenced by the growth during the year in our capital and liquidity ratios and growth in deposits 
our tier common equity ratio improved to from at december  in addition  our tier capital ratio increased to which is a basis point increase from at december  these improvements were the result of the capital raising transactions during the second quarter of  as well as lower risk weighted assets from a reduction in loans and unfunded commitments 
we also have substantial available liquidity as the inflows of high quality deposits have largely been retained in cash and invested in high quality government backed securities 
see additional discussion of our capital and liquidity position in the capital resources and liquidity risk sections of this md a 
during the year  we experienced a significant increase in consumer and commercial deposits as evidenced by an increase in average deposits compared to the prior year 
growth has occurred in all deposit products with money market and ddas comprising the majority of the increase 
this record level of deposits was driven by the industry wide trend of clients seeking the security of bank deposits  however  we believe our improved products and pricing  enhanced client service  and the live solid 
bank solid 
brand advertising specifically assisted us in attracting new clients and expanding existing relationships 
further  through an intense focus on improved execution  we have been successful in improving client satisfaction  acquisition  and retention 
additionally  as a result of the increase in these core deposits  we have been able to reduce our exposure to foreign deposits and higher cost brokered deposits by billion  or  since december  as well as higher cost long term debt by billion  or  over this same period 
while we witnessed solid growth in core deposits during  it has moderated during the latter part of the year  causing us to believe that it may further moderate going forward as the economy improves 
despite the moderation in total deposit growth  the mix of deposits continues to shift towards lower cost transaction accounts 
during the year  average loans declined billion  or  and total loans at december  were down from prior year 
our aggressive effort to reduce exposure to construction lending  as evidenced by the decline in average balances versus the previous year  was a primary driver of the decline in average loans during the year 
in addition  we reduced our exposure to residential real estate loans as evidenced by the billion  or  decrease in average residential real estate loans in the decline in the remaining loan categories is primarily due to weak loan demand as a result of the economic environment  which has caused clients to be focused on capital preservation and an allocation of excess funds for debt reduction 
the trend of declining line of credit utilization among our mid size and larger corporate clients continued due to improved access to capital markets and lower working capital needs 
we remain focused on extending credit to qualified borrowers as businesses and consumers work through the current economic downturn 
despite the reduction in our overall loan portfolio  new loan originations  commitments  and renewals of commercial and consumer loans were approximately billion during  with residential mortgage originations leading the way 

table of contents we increased our securities available for sale holdings during the year  resulting in a increase in the year end balance compared to prior year end 
this increase was led by the increase in our holdings of us treasury and agency securities by over billion in light of the increased liquidity from higher deposits and lower loan balances 
in addition  agency mbs increased by over billion 
this increase was related to sales during the year where we had the opportunity to manage the portfolio s duration by selling bonds at a gain and repositioning the mbs portfolio into securities that we believe have higher relative value 
as a result of the securities sales  we realized million in net gains during the year 
fte net interest income was billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the year ended december  fte total revenue was down to billion for the year ended december  as a result of soft revenue generation in certain areas and substantially lower securities gains compared to the prior year 
net interest margin in decreased six basis points when compared to the prior year primarily as a result of decreased loan pricing that outpaced the decreased deposit pricing during the year 
total noninterest expense increased by million  or  in  primarily driven by the million non cash goodwill impairment charge recognized during the year 
provision for credit losses was billion for the year ended  an increase of billion from the prior year 
the provision for loan losses was million higher than net charge offs of billion for the year 
the alll increased million  or  from december  and was of total loans not carried at fair value compared to as of december  net charge offs to average loans were for the year ended compared to for nonperforming assets rose during the year to billion at year end compared to billion at the end of last year 
the average shareholders equity to average total assets ratio and the tangible equity to tangible assets ratio both improved from and at december  to and  respectively  at december  we recorded million in dividends and accretion during related to preferred stock issued to the us treasury under the cpp compared to million during see additional discussion of our financial performance in the consolidated financial results section of this md a

earning asset yields declined basis points from to  and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities over the same period decreased basis points 
throughout  we experienced an upward net interest margin trend  from in the first quarter to in the fourth quarter 
the combination of liabilities re pricing at lower rates and an increase in client deposits  as well as improved deposit mix  enabled a reduction in higher cost sources of funding while loans and earning assets declined more rapidly  offsetting some of the benefit 
loan and deposit pricing are the primary opportunities to generate additional margin expansion in  while the primary risks relate to the possibility that nonperforming assets will rise and loan demand will remain sluggish 
our current expectation for net interest margin in the near term is for some compression 
a full quarter s impact of holding billion in us treasury securities and the first quarter consolidation of selected off balance sheet entities  are expected to have a small negative impact on margin which may be partially offset by improvements in deposit pricing 
additionally  we expect to experience a seasonal decline in deposits 

table of contents average earning assets decreased billion  or  from average loans decreased billion  or 
the decline is attributable to a billion  or  reduction in real estate construction loans  a billion  or  reduction in real estate family residential loans  and a billion  or  reduction in commercial loans 
the decreases in real estate construction  family residential loans and commercial loans were partially offset by increases in the commercial real estate loan portfolio of billion  or  as well as a billion  or  increase in nonperforming and restructured loans 
to offset the decline in loans  average securities available for sale increased billion  or  from due to a billion increase in mbs and a billion increase in us treasury and agency securities 
yields on average earning assets declined basis points from to driven by declines in market interest rates 
our loan portfolio yielded for the year  down basis points from a large percentage of our commercial loans are variable rate indexed to one month libor 
in order to manage interest rate risk  we utilized receive fixed pay floating interest rate swaps to hedge interest income in a declining rate environment 
that interest rate risk management strategy along with increased swap related notional balances billion of additional floating rate commercial loans were swapped to fixed rate and lower rates in resulted in swap income increasing from million in to million in while the underlying loans swapped to fixed are classified as both commercial real estate and commercial  all of the swap income is recorded as interest on commercial loans 
the classification of all swap income in the commercial loan category  combined with the increased notional value of received fixed swaps and the declining balance of commercial loans  produced a significantly smaller decline in reported commercial loan yields as compared to underlying rate indices 
in addition  loan related interest income was augmented in by our loan pricing initiatives 
average interest earning trading assets declined by billion  or 
despite the decline in trading assets  we continue to use this portfolio as part of our overall asset liability management  however  the size and nature of trading assets will fluctuate over various economic cycles 
average lhfs were billion during  an increase of from the prior year 
the increase in lhfs occurred as a result of increased mortgage loan production 
average consumer and commercial deposits increased billion  or  in compared to this growth consisted of increases of billion  or  in money market accounts  billion  or  in demand deposits  billion  or  in now accounts  and million  or  in time deposits 
deposit growth was the result of marketing campaigns  competitive pricing  and clients increased preference for the security of insured deposit products 
however  a portion of the deposit growth is related to the industry wide flight to the safety of insured deposits and reduced client demand for sweep accounts due to the low interest rate environment 
the overall growth in consumer and commercial deposits allowed for a reduction in other funding sources  including billion of brokered deposits  billion of foreign deposits  and billion of long term debt 
overall  average interest bearing liabilities declined billion  or 
we continue to pursue deposit growth initiatives to increase our presence in specific markets within our footprint 
competition for deposits remains strong  and as a result  deposit pricing pressure remains across our footprint 
despite these challenging market conditions  we have used a combination of regional and product specific pricing initiatives to balance margin and volume  while still growing our average deposit balances 
we continue to believe that we are also benefiting from a number of actions taken to improve marketplace awareness and client service 
the live solid 
bank solid 
branding campaign continues to be very well received and we believe it is helping drive client acquisition 
we also continue to refine pricing tactics to be competitive while maintaining deposit rates that are attractive to our clients 
notwithstanding these deposit generation successes  some of the deposit growth is due to seasonality and the economic environment 
deposit balances are expected to decline modestly in the first quarter related to seasonality  and further over time as the economy improves 
during  the interest rate environment was characterized by lower rates  yet a steeper yield curve versus more specifically  the fed funds target rate averaged  a decrease of basis points  the prime rate averaged  a decrease of basis points  one month libor averaged  a decrease of basis points  five year swaps averaged  a decrease of basis points  and ten year swaps averaged  a decrease of basis points 
rates paid on deposits  our most significant funding source  tend to track movements in one month libor  while our fixed rate loan yields tend to track movements in the five year swap rate 
however  due to the competition and customer demands surrounding deposits  deposit pricing has reached an effective floor in some products  as evidenced by the basis point decline in the average rate paid on interest bearing consumer and commercial deposits versus the basis point decline noted in one month libor 
foregone interest income from nonperforming loans reduced net interest margin by basis points for as average nonaccrual loans increased billion  or from see additional discussion of our expectations for future levels of credit quality in the allowance for credit losses  provision for credit losses  and nonperforming assets sections of this md a

this increase was partially offset by higher amortization of msrs due to an increase in prepayments  as well as a decline in the fair value of msrs 
mortgage production related income increased million  or  compared to  primarily due to a billion  or  increase in production volume that was partially offset by a million increase in mortgage repurchase related losses compared to the increase in production volume during was due in large part to increased refinancing activity  which we do not expect to remain at this level in the near term 
mortgage repurchase related losses increased from million in to million in as a result of increased repurchase requests from government sponsored agencies 
as discussed in more detail in note  reinsurance arrangements and guarantees  to the consolidated financial statements  we provide standard representations and warranties when loans are sold to third party investors 
if it is later determined that such representations have been breached  the investor will request that we either purchase the nonperforming loan or reimburse the investor for the loss incurred 
although mortgage repurchase reserves are established at the time of sale  actual credit losses have exceeded the original estimates and we are recognizing higher losses 
we update our loss estimate by analyzing the population of loans sold by vintage and product in relation to our recent experience and expected repurchase levels and as a result  the reserve for the repurchase of mortgage loans has increased 
a shift in the volume of repurchase requests occurred during the course of from loans originated and sold prior to during the latter half of  the majority of our repurchase requests pertained to loans originated and sold in we believe ultimate losses on newer vintages  specifically and later  may be lower than older vintages 
the elimination of alt a loan products  tighter credit and underwriting guidelines  and enhanced processes have reduced the risk profile and  therefore  the repurchase risk exposure of loans originated and sold since in addition  loans sold in recent years have lower original loan to values and are subject to less home price depreciation which should reduce loss severities 
while mortgage repurchase related losses are expected to remain elevated during  the shift towards loans originated and sold 
table of contents in more recent years gives us reason to believe that successful repurchase requests by investors and loss severities will decline 
the level of losses and reserves during are dependent primarily upon the continued shift in request volume to newer vintages and no significant deterioration in the overall asset quality of the previously sold loans as indicated by borrower payment performance 
net securities gains of billion for included a million gain on the sale and contribution of a portion of our investment in coke common stock in addition to a million gain on the sale of mbs held in conjunction with our risk management strategies associated with economically hedging the value of msrs

trading account profits losses and commissions decreased million compared to  primarily due to million in mark to market losses on our public debt and related hedges carried at fair value during compared with gains of million in the losses during were caused by an improvement in our credit spreads 
these losses were partially offset by million in market valuation losses recorded during on our investments in certain illiquid abs compared to small gains in as our exposure to these investments has been substantially reduced through sales  maturities  and write downs 
additionally  during  we recorded a million loss related to our expected repurchase of certain ars

offsetting these decreases in were increases in personnel expense  outside processing and software  regulatory assessments  visa litigation expense  debt extinguishment costs  and other economically cyclical expenses 
amortization impairment of intangible assets increased million in the primary driver of the increase was a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million recorded in the first quarter of related to the household lending  commercial real estate  and affordable housing businesses 
the impairment resulted from continued deterioration in real estate markets and the macro economy  which placed downward pressure on the fair value of our mortgage and commercial real estate related businesses  and caused the significant decline in our market capitalization during the first quarter 
the impairment charge had no impact on our regulatory capital and tangible equity ratios

credit related costs include operating losses  credit and collection services  other real estate expense and mortgage reinsurance expense 
these expenses decreased million  or  from operating losses decreased million  or  compared to primarily due to a change in classification related to borrower misrepresentation and claim denials

other real estate expense increased million  or  in compared to this increase was due to a 
table of contents million increase in valuation related losses on oreo properties and a million increase in property expenses  partially offset by net gains of million on the sale of properties 
mortgage reinsurance reserve expense  which pertains to our mortgage reinsurance subsidiary  twin rivers  decreased from million in to million in as a result of losses reaching or approaching our loss limits within the insurance contracts in twin rivers loss exposure arises from third party mortgage insurers transferring a portion of their first loss exposure when losses by mortgage origination year exceed certain thresholds 
credit and collection services expense increased million  or  in compared to due to increased collection and loss mitigation activity 
marketing and customer development expense decreased million  or  in  compared to the same period in the decrease was due to a reduction in corporate advertising and donations expense as a result of the million contribution of coke stock to the suntrust foundation made in the third quarter of and the related impact of reducing our ongoing contributions 
most of the remaining decrease related to a decline in customer development and promotion expenses 
personnel expenses in increased by million  or  from the same period in the slight increase in personnel expense is attributable to pension costs increasing from million in to million in resulting from an increase in the pension obligation due to market valuation assumptions 
the increase in pension costs were offset by a decline in salaries expense of million from to reflecting a reduction of approximately  full time equivalent employees since december  to  as of december  personnel expense was also impacted by an increase in incentive compensation primarily related to improved performance in certain businesses 
outside processing and software increased million  or  compared to primarily due to our contracting with a third party in the third quarter of to provide certain check and related processing operations 
regulatory assessments expense grew from million in to million in as a result of higher fdic insurance premium rates and increased deposit balances  as the fdic sought to replenish the insurance fund 
also contributing to the increase in was the fdic special assessment recorded in the second quarter of the special assessment was a charge that the fdic levied on all banks to assist in replenishing their reserves 
our portion of that assessment was million 
in the fourth quarter of  we prepaid three years of expected fdic premiums in accordance with a newly enacted regulatory requirement 
the total premium of million will be amortized into expense over the next three years 
the assessment will also increase in as a result of a three basis point increase which is effective january  other future assessments or taxes may occur on financial institutions as a result of legislative developments and the support of the current administration 
visa litigation expense increased by million in compared to the same period in this increase is related to a million reversal  during  of a portion of the accrued liability associated with the visa litigation as a result of the funding by visa of the litigation escrow account  partly offset by accruals based on the resolution of certain visa related matters 
net loss on debt extinguishment increased from million in to million in the increase resulted primarily from early termination fees for fhlb advances repaid during the fourth quarter of resulting in a million loss  net of gains on the early extinguishment of other long term debt 
these advance terminations were part of the initiative we took to take advantage of the strong liquidity position we currently benefit from to repay wholesale funding and improve margin 
other noninterest expense increased million  or  in compared to the increase was due primarily to write downs of million related to affordable housing properties in as compared to million of related charges in also contributing to the increase was a million increase in unfunded commitment expenses compared to  primarily related to increased loss exposure to unfunded commitments extended to a few large corporate clients and some migration in risk ratings 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began recording expense related to unfunded commitment reserves in the provision for credit losses instead of noninterest expense 
the expense which was included in the provision for credit losses during the fourth quarter of amounted to million 
partially offsetting the increase were gains from the current year sale of corporate assets and the successful resolution of specific contingent items in other operating expenses remain well controlled as a result of our ongoing commitment to improving efficiency

the decrease was primarily driven by reduced loan demand in the commercial portfolio  as well as a reduction in our exposure to residential real estate  especially construction related 
the portfolio is diversified by product  client  and geography throughout our footprint  and has relatively low exposure to unsecured consumer loan products

we continue to enhance our collections and default management processes 
from a risk management perspective  there is virtually no line availability remaining in higher risk segments ie  lines originated by third parties and lines in florida exceeding current ltv 
overall  this portfolio displayed stable asset quality metrics  however  the portfolio continues to under perform 
the commercial loan portfolio decreased billion  or  from december  and comprises of total loans at december  the reduction in the commercial portfolio resulted primarily from a continued trend of declining line of credit utilization among our mid size and larger corporate clients due to lower working capital needs and enhanced access to the capital markets 
the pace of decline did slow during the fourth quarter 
the portfolio is diversified by industry  geography  client segment  and collateral  and continues to perform reasonably well overall 
the commercial real estate portfolio was billion  or of total loans  an increase of million  or  from december  the increase was attributable to the natural migration of loans maturing from the construction real estate loan portfolio into mini perm financing

we have reduced the level of risk in the construction portfolio by aggressively managing our construction exposure 
this reduction is evident from the billion  or  decline in outstanding balances since december commercial related construction loans represent of the total construction portfolio and credit performance remains acceptable overall 
performance of residential construction related loans remained weak  however  during the fourth quarter days delinquencies declined 
we continue to be proactive in our credit monitoring and management processes to provide early warning for problem loans in the portfolio 
for example  we use an expanded liquidity and contingency analysis to provide a thorough view of borrower capacity and their ability to service obligations in a steep market decline 
we also have strict limits and exposure caps on specific projects and borrowers for risk diversification 
due to the lack of new construction projects and the completion of many that were previously started  the aggregate amount of interest reserves that we are obligated to fund is down from prior periods 
the indirect consumer portfolio was billion  or of total loans  at december   up million  or  from december  the increase is partially attributable to new vehicle sales triggered by the federal government cash for clunkers incentive program 
this portfolio is experiencing a reduced level of charge offs compared to and is benefiting from lower fuel prices  stabilized used car values  and natural turnover into newly underwritten vintages 
the direct consumer portfolio was billion  or of total loans  at december   down million  or  from december  student loans  which are mostly government supported  made up billion  or approximately of the direct consumer portfolio

during the second quarter of  the company revised its method of calculating this ratio to include  within the nonperforming loan amount  only loans measured at amortized cost 
previously  this calculation included nonperforming loans measured at fair value or the lower of cost or market 
the company believes this is an improved method of calculation due to the fact that the allowance for loan losses relates solely to the loans measured at amortized cost 
nonperforming loans measured at fair value or the lower of cost or market that have been excluded from the calculation were million  which increased the calculation approximately basis points as of december  amounts excluded in years prior to were immaterial and resulted in no basis point change in the respective calculation 
prior to  borrower misrepresentation fraud and denied insurance claim losses were recorded as operating losses in the consolidated statements of income loss 
these credit related operating losses totaled million and million during the year ended december  and  respectively

this ratio is calculated using the allowance for loan and lease losses 

table of contents allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses consists of the alll as well as the reserve for unfunded commitments 
we continuously monitor the credit quality of our loan portfolio and maintain an alll sufficient to absorb current probable and estimable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
we are committed to the timely recognition of problem loans and maintaining an appropriate and adequate alll 
in addition to the review of credit quality through ongoing credit review processes  we employ a variety of modeling and estimation techniques to measure credit risk and construct an appropriate alll 
numerous asset quality measures  both quantitative and qualitative  are considered in estimating the alll 
our alll committee has the responsibility of affirming the allowance methodology and assessing significant risk elements in order to determine the appropriate level of allowance for the inherent losses in the loan portfolio at the point in time being reviewed 
the multiple factors evaluated include internal risk ratings  net charge off trends  collateral values and geographic location  borrower fico scores  delinquency rates  nonperforming and restructured loans  origination channel  product mix  underwriting practices  and economic trends 
these credit quality factors are incorporated into various loss estimation models and analytical tools utilized in our alll process and or are qualitatively considered in evaluating the overall reasonableness of the alll 
the factors that have the greatest quantitative impact on the estimated alll tend to be internal risk rating trends  recent net charge off trends  delinquency rates  and loss severity levels ie  collateral values 
other factors such as nonperforming or restructured loans tend to have a more isolated impact on subsets of loans in the loan pools 
also impacting the alll is the estimated incurred loss period  which tends to be approximately one year for consumer related loans and between one and one quarter to three years for wholesale related loans 
during periods of economic stress  the incurred loss period tends to contract 
the alll process excludes loans measured at fair value as subsequent mark to market adjustments related to loans measured at fair value include a credit risk component 
starting in third quarter  the alll includes results from a recently enhanced residential mortgage loss forecast model 
the model utilizes more granular loan specific information  as well as home price index changes at the metropolitan statistical area level to estimate incurred losses and loss severities 
the enhanced modeling capabilities  as well as declines in the home price index  resulted in increases to average loss severity estimates related to residential mortgage loans  which partially contributed to the increase in the alll 
at december   the alll was  million  which represented of period end loans not carried at fair value 
this compares with an alll of  million  or of period end loans not carried at fair value  as of december  the year over year increase of million in the alll is comprised of quarterly increases of million december  to march   million march  to june   million june  to september   and million september  to december  which reflects a declining trend in alll increases as a result of stabilizing leading asset quality indicators 
the year over year increase in alll reflects  among other items  the current economic downturn  decreasing home prices  and higher losses in the residential and commercial real estate related portions of the loan portfolio 
future changes in the alll will depend significantly on credit quality indicators  which are highly influenced by the broader economy 
the majority of the increase in the allowance for loan losses pertained to the residential real estate related portion of the loan portfolio and specific reserves for residential developers 
in the first quarter of  we began classifying losses associated with borrower misrepresentation and insurance claim denials in the alll 
previously  these fraud related losses were recorded in operating losses within noninterest expense 
these losses are now being recorded in the alll since we believe that borrower credit related issues due to the deteriorating economic environment have become the predominant contributor to the losses 
realized losses on these loans are reflected as charge offs 
our alll framework has two basic elements specific allowances for loans individually evaluated for impairment and a component for pools of homogeneous loans not individually evaluated 
the first element of the alll analysis involves the estimation of allowance specific to individually evaluated impaired loans including accruing and nonaccruing restructured commercial and consumer loans 
in this process  specific allowance is established for larger commercial impaired loans based on an analysis of the most probable sources of repayment  including discounted cash flows  liquidation of collateral  or the market value of the loan itself 
restructured consumer loans are also evaluated in this element of the estimate 
as of december   the specific allowance related to commercial impaired loans individually evaluated and restructured consumer loans totaled million  compared to million as of december   million of this increase is driven by the loan modification efforts on consumer and residential loans 
specific reserves associated with larger commercial loans individually evaluated increased million to million at december  this increase is primarily driven by deterioration in loans to residential builders 
the second element of the alll  the general allowance for homogeneous loan pools not individually evaluated  is determined by applying allowance factors to pools of loans within the portfolio that have similar risk characteristics 
the general allowance factors are determined using a baseline factor that is developed from an analysis of historical net charge off experience and expected losses 
expected losses are based on estimated probabilities of default and loss given default derived from our internal risk rating process 
these baseline factors are developed and applied to the various loan pools 
adjustments may be made to baseline reserves for some of the loan pools based on an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data 
these influences may include elements such as changes in credit underwriting  concentration risk  macroeconomic conditions  and or recent observable asset quality trends 

table of contents we continually evaluate our alll methodology seeking to refine and enhance this process as appropriate  and it is likely that the methodology will continue to evolve over time 
as of december   the general allowance totaled  million 
this compares to a general allowance totaling  million as of december  the increase was primarily driven by declining home prices and the associated deterioration in credit quality of the residential mortgage and home equity lines of credit portfolios 
increases to the commercial related reserves were driven by higher expected loss factors 
our charge off policy meets or exceeds regulatory minimums 
losses on unsecured consumer loans are recognized at days past due compared to the regulatory loss criteria of days 
secured consumer loans  including residential real estate  are typically charged down to net realizable value at and days delinquent  depending on the collateral type  in compliance with ffiec guidelines 
commercial loans and real estate loans are typically placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest is past due for days or more unless the loan is both secured by collateral having value sufficient to discharge the debt in full and the loan is in the legal process of collection 
accordingly  secured loans may be charged down or reserves established to the estimated value of the collateral with previously accrued unpaid interest reversed 
subsequent reserves and or charge offs may be required as a result of changes in the market value of collateral or other repayment prospects 
initial reserves and or charge off amounts are based on valuation estimates derived from either appraisals  broker price opinions  or other market information 
generally  updated appraisals are received within days of the foreclosure process 
however  collateral values are updated and reviewed periodically based on market information from multiple sources 
net charge offs during were billion  an increase of billion from net charge offs to average loans ratio was and as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in net charge offs reflects the effects of the housing crisis and related economic downturn 
the largest increases were seen in residential mortgage million  commercial million  real estate construction million and home equity lines million 
we do not originate subprime consumer real estate loans  however lower residential real estate values and recessionary economic conditions have affected borrowers of higher credit quality 
construction net charge offs increased due to the resolution of loan workouts in the residential builder construction portfolio 
the increase in commercial net charge offs was driven by relatively fewer  but larger credits in unrelated  economically cyclical industries as well as small businesses 
during the fourth quarter of  net charge offs declined across most loan categories  except residential construction  which increased as a result of continued workout activities 
overall  our outlook is for elevated net charge offs in the near term  particularly related to residential mortgages associated with loans migrating to foreclosure  with the possibility that improvement could begin in the second half of depending on the strength and pace of economic recovery 
the ratio of the alll to total nonperforming loans decreased to as of december  from as of december  the decline in this ratio was due to a billion increase in nonperforming loans compared to  driven primarily by increases in residential mortgage and real estate construction nonperforming loans  partially offset by the million increase in the alll 
the increase in nonperforming loans was driven primarily by deteriorating economic conditions and declining home values in most markets that we serve as well as home builders and commercial loans in economically sensitive businesses 
we write down residential nonperforming loans to the expected value of the underlying collateral  less estimated selling costs as measured at the time the loan is days past due 
declines  if any  in the collateral value of the nonperforming loans subsequent to the initial charge off are captured in the alll and then recognized as additional charge offs upon foreclosure 
the charge off is applied against the alll  therefore  the relationship between alll and nonperforming loans becomes less correlated since the carrying value of such charged off nonperforming loans has already recognized losses that are estimated to be realized at that point in time 
another factor that impacts the alll to nonperforming loans ratio is that most of the nonperforming loans have some amount of net residual value  therefore  while the entire loan is classified as nonperforming  only the amount of estimated losses that has not already been charged off would be captured in the alll 
product mix of nonperforming loans and the related charge off practices are relevant considerations in the evaluation of alll coverage of nonperforming loans 
the reserve for unfunded commitments was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
lending commitments such as letters of credit and binding unfunded loan commitments are assessed similarly to funded wholesale loans except utilization assumptions are considered 
larger nonperforming unfunded commitments and letters of credit are individually evaluated for loss content 
the million increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments reflects the deterioration in the overall economy and credit conditions during the year 
we do not anticipate this level of growth to continue during unless the economic environment deteriorates significantly 
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses  relating to funded loans  as well as the provision for unfunded commitments 
the provision for loan losses is the result of a detailed analysis estimating an appropriate and adequate alll 
the provision for loan losses during totaled billion  an increase of billion  or  from the increase in the provision for loan losses is primarily driven by elevated losses and increases in alll due to 
table of contents deteriorating asset quality conditions in the residential related and wholesale portfolios 
we expect net charge offs and the provision for loan losses to remain at elevated levels until we experience a sustained improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
the amount of future growth in the alll is highly correlated to unemployment levels  changes in home prices within our markets  especially florida  as well as sustained improvement in our portfolio specific credit quality indicators

we experienced slight declines in total nonperforming assets and total nonperforming loans over the last six months of as well as a decline in early stage delinquencies 
the slight decline in total nonperforming loans was primarily related to commercial and construction loans  partially offset by increases in residential mortgages and commercial real estate loans 
of the billion in nonaccruing loans  approximately is related to residential real estate 
residential mortgages and home equity lines represent of total nonaccruals 
the increase in nonperforming assets is largely related to the housing correction and related decline in the values of residential real estate 
the nonperforming assets are also affected by the time it takes to complete the foreclosure process  especially in judicial jurisdictions 
the asset quality of the residential mortgage portfolio showed signs of stabilization and moderating growth in nonperforming loans during the fourth quarter  although on an absolute basis  this portfolio continues to perform poorly 
we have noted an increase in the amount of time it takes us to foreclose upon residential real estate collateral in certain states  primarily florida  which we believe is primarily due to delays in the judicial foreclosure process 
we apply rigorous loss mitigation processes to these nonperforming loans to ensure that the asset value is preserved to the greatest extent possible  despite these efforts  it is likely we will realize additional losses on these nonperforming assets in the future 
nonperforming residential mortgages are primarily collateralized by one to four family residential properties 
approximately of the nonperforming loans relate to properties in our footprint  approximately of such nonperforming loans are in florida 
approximately of the nonperforming residential mortgages have been on nonaccrual status for at least six months 
we have reached a point where growth in residential mortgage nonperforming loans has slowed as we are approaching the equilibrium point where the nonperforming loan outflow from foreclosures is offsetting the inflow from new nonperforming loans 
approximately of the nonperforming home equity lines were from lines originated by third parties  lines in florida with combined ltvs greater than  or lines in other states with combined ltvs greater than 
beginning in  we tightened the underwriting standards applicable to many of the residential loan products offered 
nonaccrual construction loans were billion  an increase of million  or  from december  approximately of the nonperforming construction loans are secured by residential real estate  specifically  million 
table of contents construction to perm  million residential construction  and million in residential land  acquisition  and development properties 
beginning in september  underwriting standards were tightened for new loan originations in the construction to perm portfolio 
at this point  we believe that the residential construction nonperforming loans are at or near their peak 
the vast majority of the problem loans in the portfolio have been identified and are in the workout process 
as a result  charge offs will remain elevated  but declining  over the next two to three quarters as we continue workout activities 
nonaccrual commercial loans were million  up million  or  from december  the increase was driven primarily by loans to a few larger commercial borrowers in economically cyclical industries together with loans to mid size borrowers 
commercial loan charge offs  early stage delinquency and nonperforming loans declined in the fourth quarter 
we continue to see some stress in more cyclically sensitive industries and in our small business portfolio 
nonaccrual commercial real estate loans increased by million  or  to million compared to december  the increase occurred in a variety of property types  including office and hotel 
the composition of commercial real estate nonaccruals is split almost equally between owner occupied and investor owned loans 
early stage delinquencies days past due were stable to declining in almost all of our non residential secured consumer portfolios 
the exception was in the consumer direct portfolio  which is largely comprised of federally guaranteed or privately insured student loans  and which drove the increase 
excluding student loans  the early stage delinquency ratio for the consumer direct portfolio was 
total early stage delinquencies declined to as of december  from as of september  and as of december  in order to maximize the collection of loan balances  we evaluate accounts that experience financial difficulties on a case by case basis to determine if their terms should be modified 
we are aggressively pursuing modifications when there is a reasonable chance that the modification will allow the client to continue servicing the debt 
for residential real estate secured loans  if the client demonstrates a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support even a modified loan  we strongly encourage short sales and deed in lieu arrangements 
accruing loans with modifications that are deemed to be economic concessions resulting from borrower difficulties are reported as tdrs 
nonaccruing loans that are modified and demonstrate a history of repayment performance in accordance with their modified terms are reclassified to accruing restructured typically after six months of repayment performance 
nonaccruing restructured loans were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
accruing restructured loans were billion at december   an increase of billion  or  from december  of these tdrs  are first and second lien residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit  and not commercial or commercial real estate loans 
at december   specific reserves included in the alll for all consumer real estate tdrs accruing and nonaccruing were million 
in addition  we have already recorded approximately million in charge offs on the nonaccruing tdrs and also have million in mark to market adjustments on tdrs carried at fair value 
these loans are primarily residential related and are being restructured in a variety of ways to help our clients remain in their homes and mitigate potential additional loss to us 
the primary restructuring methods offered to our clients are reductions in interest rates and extensions in terms 
the increase in loan modifications also impacted the moderation in nonperforming loan growth and early stage delinquencies 
within the accruing tdr portfolio  of loans are current on principal and interest and of the total tdr portfolio is current 
not all restructurings will ultimately result in the complete collection of principal and interest  as modified 
we anticipate that some of the restructured loans will default  which could result in incremental losses to us  which has been factored into our overall alll estimate 
the level of re defaults will be affected by future economic conditions 
generally  once a consumer loan becomes a tdr  it is probable that the loan will likely continue to be reported as tdr until it ultimately pays off in most circumstances 
interest income on nonaccrual loans  if recognized  is recorded using the cash basis method of accounting 
during and  this amounted to million and million  respectively 
for and  estimated interest income of million and million  respectively  would have been recorded if all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms 
interest income on restructured loans that have met their performance criteria and have been returned to accruing status is recognized according to the terms of the restructuring 
during  this amounted to million 
for  estimated interest income of million would have been recorded if all loans returned to accruing status had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms 
during  the difference between income under original contractual terms and the modified terms for restructured loans was insignificant 
as of december   accruing loans past due ninety days or more increased by million  or  from december  to billion 
included in this accruing loan population are million and million of loans at december  and december   respectively  that have been sold to gnma and are fully insured by the fha and the va 
when loans are sold to gnma  we retain an option to repurchase the loans when they become delinquent 
as such  we are required to record these loans on our balance sheet when our option becomes exercisable 
also included in the accruing loans past due ninety days or more as of december  and december  were million and million  respectively  of student loans which were federally guaranteed at various levels between and 

table of contents oreo as of december  was million  an increase of million  or  from december  the growth consists of a million increase in construction related properties primarily driven by residential construction of million and commercial properties of million  acquired through foreclosure offset by a net decrease of million in residential homes 
the amount of inflows and outflows has increased over the past several quarters as nonperforming loans migrate through the resolution process 
most of our oreo properties are located in georgia  florida  and north carolina

selected financial instruments carried at fair value certain financial instruments such as trading securities  derivatives  and securities available for sale are required to be carried at fair value 
companies are also permitted to elect to carry specific financial instruments at fair value to avoid some of the complexities of hedge accounting and more closely align the economics of their business with their results of operations without having to explain a mixed attribute accounting model 
based on our balance sheet management strategies and objectives  we have elected to carry certain other financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
these instruments include all  or a portion  of the following debt  residential mortgage loans  brokered deposits  and trading loans 
we record changes in these instruments fair values through earnings and economically hedge and or trade these assets or liabilities in order to manage the instrument s fair value volatility and economic value

table of contents trading assets and liabilities trading assets decreased billion  or  since december  the majority of the decrease consisted of a billion reduction in trading debt securities  which was primarily driven by the sale in the first quarter of of approximately billion of our agency trading portfolio that consisted of fhlb floating rate notes 
the sale of these securities was completed primarily to reduce low yielding securities and improve margin 
cp decreased million from million at december  to million at december  the decrease is primarily due to the discontinuation of the federal reserve bank of boston s abcp mmmf liquidity facility program that was implemented in which allowed eligible depository institutions  bank holding companies  and affiliated broker dealers to purchase certain abcp from certain mmmf 
other debt securities decreased million during the year ended december  of this decrease  million was the result of the temporary suspension and wind down of the trs business 
see note  certain transfers of financial assets  mortgage servicing rights and variable interest entities  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our trs business 
derivative assets and liabilities also decreased in by billion and billion  respectively  of which billion and million  respectively  was driven by the movements in fair values of interest rate based derivatives including million in terminated interest rate swaps on fhlb advances that were repaid in the first quarter of in addition  million of the decrease in derivative assets was due to the decline in fair value of our cash flow hedges related to the probable forecasted sale of coke common shares  which change in fair value also increased the derivative liabilities by million 
the termination of trs transactions resulted in the decrease of derivative assets and liabilities during of million and million  respectively 
the remaining decrease in derivative assets and liabilities was primarily due to the partial termination of cross currency swaps hedging foreign denominated debt and the changes in fair value of those hedge positions still outstanding 
certain abs were purchased during the fourth quarter of from affiliates and certain ars were purchased primarily in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of the securities acquired during the fourth quarter of included sivs that are collateralized by various domestic and foreign assets  residential mbs including alt a and subprime collateral  cdo  and commercial loans  as well as super senior interests retained from company sponsored securitizations 
during the year ended december   we recognized approximately million in net market valuation gains related to these abs 
through sales  maturities and write downs  we reduced our exposure to these distressed assets by approximately billion since the acquisition in the fourth quarter of  reducing the exposure at december  to approximately million 
during  we received approximately million in sales proceeds and million in payments related to securities acquired during the fourth quarter of we continue to actively evaluate our holdings of these securities with the objective of opportunistically lowering our exposure to them 
in addition  we expect paydowns to continue on many of the residential mbs 
all but a small amount of the remaining acquired asset portfolio consists of sivs undergoing enforcement proceedings and  therefore  any significant reduction in the portfolio will largely depend on the status of those proceedings 
during the second quarter of  one of our three remaining sivs liquidated as a result of the completion of enforcement proceedings  this liquidation resulted in proceeds of million and a realized gain of million  due to the liquidation value being slightly above our recorded fair value  that was recorded in trading account profits losses and commissions in the consolidated statements of income loss for the year ended december  during  we received approximately million in partial payments on the remaining sivs undergoing enforcement 
while further losses are possible  our experience during and reinforces our belief that we have appropriately written these assets down to fair value as of december  the estimated market value of these securities is based on market information  where available  along with significant  unobservable third party data 
as a result of the high degree of judgment and estimates used to value these illiquid securities  the market values could vary significantly in future periods 
see difficult to value financial assets and liabilities included in this md a for more information 
the amount of ars recorded in trading assets at fair value totaled million at december  and million at december  the majority of these ars are preferred equity securities  and the remaining securities consist of abs backed by trust preferred bank debt or student loans

the fund received a cash payment for the accrued interest along with a million note that we issued 
ridgeworth  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  is the investment adviser to the fund 
the lehman brothers security went into default when lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september we took this 
table of contents action in response to the unprecedented market events during the third quarter and to protect investors in the fund from losses associated with this specific security 
when purchased by the fund  the lehman brothers security was rated a p and was a tier eligible security 
during  we recorded a pre tax market valuation loss of million as a result of the purchase 
during  we sold this security  recognizing a gain for the year of million 
we evaluated this transaction under the applicable accounting guidance and concluded that we were not the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidation of the fund was not appropriate

difficult to value financial assets and liabilities the broad credit crisis that was triggered by the subprime loan melt down intensified throughout and  as the broader economy continued to worsen  the credit and liquidity markets became dysfunctional 
the second half of was marked by turmoil in the financial sector  with the failure or government induced acquisitions of several large banks and investment banks  increased unemployment  and further declines in real estate values 
additional liquidity adjustments were made on many securities  and wider spreads caused valuing our level financial instruments to become even more difficult 
initially in  we saw continued volatility with the credit crisis further eroding liquidity and investor confidence  however  we began to experience the return of some stability in certain financial markets throughout the majority of in spite of some improvement in the market  record high mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures led to further downward pressure on certain private residential mortgage backed products 
as a result  loss projections used by investors to estimate cash flows of these products more than doubled during the year  particularly for vintage private mbs 
fair value is the estimated price using market based inputs or assumptions that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
current market conditions have led to diminished  and in some cases  non existent trading in certain of the financial asset classes that we own 
we are required to consider observable inputs  to the extent available  in the fair value estimation process  unless that data results from forced liquidations or distressed sales 
when available  we will obtain third party broker quotes or use observable market assumptions  as these levels of evidence are the strongest support for fair value  absent current market activity in that specific security or a similar security 
despite our best efforts to maximize the use of relevant observable inputs  the current market environment has generally diminished the observability of trades and assumptions that have historically been available 
as such  the degree to which significant unobservable inputs have been utilized in our valuation procedures has increased over the past two years  largely with respect to certain types of loans and securities 
this decrease in observability of market data began in the third quarter of and continued to persist in certain markets in however  we have begun to observe increased trading activity in certain markets  such as corporate debt markets both primary and secondary and the market for small business administration instruments  which has provided corroborating evidence for our estimates of fair value 
the lack of liquidity  as evidenced by significant decreases in the volume and level of activity in certain markets  creates additional challenges when estimating the fair value of certain financial instruments 
generally  the assets and liabilities most affected by the lack of liquidity are those classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
this lack of liquidity has caused us to evaluate the performance of the underlying collateral and use a discount rate commensurate with the rate a market participant would use to value the instrument in an orderly transaction  but that also acknowledges illiquidity premiums and required investor rates of return that would be demanded under current market conditions 
the discount rate considered the capital structure of the instrument  market indices  and the relative yields of instruments for which third party pricing information and or market activity was available 
in certain instances  the interest rate and credit risk components of the valuation indicated a full return of expected principal and interest  however  the lack of liquidity resulted in wide ranges of discounts in valuing level securities 
the current illiquid markets are requiring discounts of this degree to drive a market competitive yield  as well as account for the anticipated extended tenor 
the discount rates selected derived reasonable prices when compared to i observable transactions  when available  ii other securities on a relative basis  iii the bid ask spread of non binding broker indicative bids and or iv our professional judgment 
for certain securities  particularly non investment grade mbs  a reasonable market discount rate could not be determined using those methodologies and  therefore  dollar prices were established based on market intelligence 
pricing services and broker quotes were obtained when available to assist in estimating the fair value of level instruments 
the number of quotes we obtained varied based on the number of brokers following a particular security  but we generally 
table of contents attempt to obtain two to four quotes to determine reasonableness and comparability on a relative basis  however  the ability to obtain reasonable and reliable broker quotes or price indications continues to be challenging 
we gained an understanding of the information used by third party pricing sources to develop their estimated values 
the information obtained from third party pricing sources was evaluated and relied upon based on the degree of market transactions supporting the price indications and the firmness of the broker quotes 
in most cases  the current market conditions caused the broker quotes to be indicative and the price indications and broker quotes to be supported by very limited to no recent market activity 
in those instances  we weighted the third party information according to our judgment of it being a reasonable indication of the instrument s fair value 
generally  pricing services values and broker quotes obtained on level instruments were indications of value based on price indications  market intelligence  and proprietary cash flow modeling techniques  but could not otherwise be supported by recent trades due to the illiquidity in the markets 
these values were evaluated in relation to other securities  and other broker indications  as well as our independent knowledge of the security s collateral 
we believe that we evaluated all available information to estimate the value of level instruments 
the continued decline in the amount of third party information available necessitates the further use of internal models when valuing level instruments 
all of the techniques used and information obtained in the valuation process provides a range of estimated values  which were evaluated and compared in order to establish an estimated value that  based on management s judgment  represented a reasonable estimate of the instrument s fair value 
it was not uncommon for the range of value of these instruments to vary widely  in such cases  we selected an estimated value that we believed was the best indication of value based on the yield a market participant in this current environment would expect 
beginning in the first quarter of  management established a level valuation working group to evaluate the available information pertaining to certain securities and ultimately develop a consensus estimate of the instrument s fair value 
the process involves the gathering of multiple sources of information  including broker quotes  values provided by pricing services  trading activity in other similar securities  market indices  and internal cash flow and pricing matrix estimates 
participation in this working group includes the business or functional area that manages the instrument  market risk  and finance  including the independent price verification function 
pricing estimates are derived on most illiquid instruments weekly and at a minimum monthly  and the working group formally reviews the pricing information at least quarterly 
these reviews may include assessing an instrument s classification in the fair value hierarchy based on the significance of the unobservable assumptions used to estimate the fair value 
we used significant unobservable inputs to fair value  on a recurring basis  certain trading assets  securities available for sale  portfolio loans accounted for at fair value  irlcs  lhfs  msrs and certain derivatives

table of contents securities available for sale and trading assets our level securities available for sale totals approximately billion at december   including fhlb and federal reserve bank stock  as well as certain municipal bond securities  some of which are only redeemable with the issuer at par and cannot be traded in the market  as such  no significant observable market data for these instruments is available 
these nonmarketable securities total approximately million at december  level trading assets total approximately million at december  the remaining level securities  both trading assets and available for sale securities  are predominantly private mbs and collateral debt obligations  including interests retained from company sponsored securitizations or purchased from third party securitizations and investments in sivs 
we have also increased our exposure to bank trust preferred abs  student loan abs  and municipal securities due to our purchase of certain ars as a result of failed auctions 
for all of the level securities  little or no market activity exists for either the security or the underlying collateral and therefore the significant assumptions used to value the securities are not market observable 
approximately half of the collateral in the remaining level securities includes direct or repackaged exposure to residential mortgages which is predominantly secured by vintage prime first lien mortgage loans  however  there is also exposure to prime first and second lien mortgages  as well as subprime first and second lien mortgages that were originated from through level trading liabilities consists of the coke derivative valued at approximately million at december  ars purchased since the auction rate market began failing in february have been considered level securities due to the significant decrease in the volume and level of activity in these markets which has necessitated the use of significant unobservable inputs into our valuations 
we classify ars as securities available for sale or trading securities 
as of december   the fair value of ars purchased is approximately million in trading assets and million in available for sale securities 
ars include municipal bonds  nonmarketable preferred equity securities  and abs collateralized by student loans or trust preferred bank obligations 
under a functioning market  ars could be remarketed with tight interest rate caps to investors targeting short term investment securities that repriced generally every to days 
unlike other short term instruments  these ars do not benefit from backup liquidity lines or letters of credit and  therefore  as auctions began to fail  investors were left with securities that were more akin to longer term  year  illiquid bonds  with the anticipation that auctions will continue to fail in the foreseeable future 
the combination of materially increased tenors  capped interest rates and general market illiquidity has had a significant impact on the risk profiles of these securities and has resulted in the use of valuation techniques and models that rely on significant inputs that are largely unobservable 
we saw a reduction in our level portfolios during due to sales  paydowns  transfers of assets from level to level  and or continued deterioration in values of certain securities  in particular  private mbs 
at december   we hold assets in two sivs that are in receivership and are carried at a fair value of approximately million 
our holdings of siv assets decreased by million during  due to settlements or partial paydown of approximately million  offset by gains of approximately million 
the gain resulted primarily from the improvement in the cash positions of the sivs as well as modest improvements in the value of the underlying assets 
our level portfolio has experienced a significant number and amount of downgrades during this time of economic turmoil 
while our level municipal securities and equity securities are of high credit quality  certain vintages of private mbs have suffered from deterioration in credit quality leading to downgrades 
at december   our private mbs contained approximately million of vintage securities available for sale and trading securities and approximately million of vintage securities available for sale and trading securities that had been downgraded to non investment grade levels by at least one nationally recognized rating agency 
the vast majority of these securities had high investment grade ratings at the time of origination or purchase 
all of these securities that are classified as available for sale are also included as part of our quarterly otti evaluation process 
see note  securities available for sale  to the consolidated financial statements for details regarding impairment recognized through earnings on private mbs during the year ended december  residual and other retained interests classified as securities available for sale or trading securities are valued based on internal models that incorporate assumptions  such as prepayment speeds  estimated credit losses  and discount rates which are generally not observable in the current markets 
generally  we attempt to obtain pricing for our securities from a third party pricing provider or third party brokers who have experience in valuing certain investments 
this pricing may be used as either direct support for our valuations or used to validate outputs from our own proprietary models 
we evaluate third party pricing to determine the reasonableness of the information relative to changes in market data such as any recent trades we executed  market information received from outside market participants and analysts  and or changes in the underlying collateral performance 
when actual trades are not available to corroborate pricing information received  we will use industry standard or proprietary models to estimate fair value  and will consider assumptions such as relevant market indices that correlate to the underlying collateral  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity rates  and discount rates 
due to the continued illiquidity and credit risk of level securities  these market values are highly sensitive to assumption changes and market volatility 
in many instances  pricing assumptions for level securities may fall within 
table of contents an acceptable range of values 
in those cases  we attempt to consider all information to determine the most appropriate price within that range 
improvements may be made to our pricing methodologies on an ongoing basis as observable and relevant information becomes available to us 
sales  trading and settlement activity were scarce in for many of our level securities  however  we maintained consistency in our pricing methodology and processes  and incorporated any relevant changes to the valuation assumptions needed to ensure a supportable fair value for these illiquid securities  based on market conditions at december  during the year ended december   we recognized through earnings million in net losses related to trading assets and securities available for sale classified as level while we believe we have utilized all pertinent market data in establishing an appropriate fair value for our securities  current market conditions result in wide price ranges used to evaluate market value 
while it is difficult to accurately predict the ultimate cash value of these securities  we believe the amount that would be ultimately realized if the securities were held to settlement or maturity will generally be greater than the current fair value of the securities classified as level this assessment is based on the current performance of the underlying collateral  which is experiencing elevated losses but generally not to the degree that correlates to current market values  which is pressured downward in this market due to liquidity issues and other broad macroeconomic conditions 
it is reasonably likely that this market volatility will continue as a result of a variety of external factors  including but not limited to economic conditions  the sale of assets under government sponsored programs  the restructuring of sivs  and third party sales of securities  some of which could be large scale 
during the year ended december   our level assets were temporarily increased due to the purchase of approximately billion of three pillars cp which was then transferred out of level to level due to increased market trading levels subsequent to our purchases which ultimately reduced our outstanding amount to zero as of december  we continued to see a reduction in other level trading assets and securities available for sale as the net result of purchases  sales  issuances  settlements  maturities  and paydowns 
included in this net reduction were purchases of level ars totaling million  of which million was classified as trading securities and million was classified as securities available for sale 
no other significant purchases of level trading assets or available for sale securities were added 
we also redeemed stock in the fhlb of approximately million which is classified as level available for sale securities 
a modest amount of available for sale securities were transferred into level consisting of municipal bonds for which no observable activity exists 
we also transferred us treasury and federal agency trading securities out of level consisting of small business administration securities for which the volume and level of observable trading activity had significantly decreased in prior quarters  but for which we began to observe limited increases in such activity during the three months ended march  and significant increases in such activity during the rest of this level of activity provided us with sufficient market evidence of pricing  such that we did not have to make any significant adjustments to observed pricing  nor was our pricing based on unobservable data 
as such  this portfolio was transferred out of level most derivative instruments are level or level instruments  except for the irlcs  the visa litigation related derivative  discussed below  and the agreements we entered into related to our investment in coke common stock  which are level instruments 
because the value of the agreements is primarily driven by the embedded equity collars on the coke common shares  a black scholes model is the appropriate valuation model 
most of the assumptions are directly observable from the market  such as the per share market price of coke common stock  interest rates  and the dividend rate on coke common stock 
volatility is a significant assumption and is impacted both by the unusually large size of the trade and the long tenor until settlement 
the agreements carry scheduled terms of approximately six and a half and seven years from the effective date  and as such  the observable and active options market on coke does not provide for any identical or similar instruments 
as a result  we receive estimated market values from a market participant who is knowledgeable about coke equity derivatives and is active in the market 
based on inquiries of the market participant as to their procedures as well as our own valuation assessment procedures  we have satisfied ourselves that the market participant is using methodologies and assumptions that other market participants would use in arriving at the fair value of the agreements 
at december   the agreements were in a liability position to us of approximately million 
loans and loans held for sale level loans are primarily non agency residential mortgage loans held for investment or lhfs for which there is little to no observable trading in either the new issuance or secondary loan markets as either whole loans or as securities 
prior to the non agency residential loan market disruption  which began during the third quarter of and continues  we were able to obtain certain observable pricing from either the new issuance or secondary loan market 
however  as the markets deteriorated and certain loans were not actively trading as either whole loans or as securities  we began employing the same alternative valuation methodologies used to value level residential mbs to fair value the mortgage loans 
during the years ended december  and  we transferred million and million  respectively  of loans that were previously designated as held for sale to held for investment  as they were determined to be no longer 
table of contents marketable 
of these amounts  million during the year ended december   and million during the year ended december  were lhfs reported at fair value and will continue to be reported at fair value as loans held for investment 
on may   we acquired of the outstanding common shares of gb t 
we elected to account for million of the acquired loans  which were classified as nonaccrual  at fair value 
upon acquisition  the loans had a fair value of million 
these loans are primarily commercial real estate loans which do not trade in an active secondary market  and as such  are considered level instruments 
as these loans are all classified as nonperforming  cash proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral is the expected source of repayment for the majority of these loans 
in order to fair value these loans  we utilized market data  when available  as well as internal assumptions  to derive fair value estimates of the underlying collateral 
during the year ended december   we recorded through earnings a gain of million on these loans compared to a loss of million on these loans during the year ended december  on december   primarily as a result of paydowns  payoffs  and transfers to oreo  the loans had a fair value of million 
other intangible assets we record msrs at fair value on both a recurring and non recurring basis 
see note  fair value election and measurement  to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the valuation methodology  underlying assumptions and validation procedures performed 
other assets liabilities  net during the second quarter of  in connection with our sale of visa class b shares  we entered into a derivative contract whereby the ultimate cash payments received or paid  if any  under the contract are based on the ultimate resolution of litigation involving visa 
the value of the derivative is estimated based on our expectations regarding the ultimate resolution of that litigation  which involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity 
as a result  the value of the derivative liability was classified as a level instrument 
see note  reinsurance arrangements and guarantees  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the fair value methodology and assumptions related to our irlcs is described in note  fair value election and measurement  to the consolidated financial statements 
long term debt we elect to carry a portion of our publicly issued  fixed rate debt at fair value 
the debt consists of a number of different issuances that carry coupon rates ranging from to  resulting in a weighted average rate of  and maturities from may  through april   resulting in a weighted average life of years 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized net losses of million and net gains of million  respectively  in noninterest income associated with fair value changes in the debt and related derivatives and trading securities that provide an economic offset to the change in the value of the debt 
credit spreads widened throughout and the first quarter of in connection with the continued deterioration of the broader financial markets and a number of failures in the financial services industry 
however  credit spreads tightened throughout the remainder of after the scap results were published and additional capital was raised 
further fluctuations in our credit spreads are likely to occur in the future based on instrument specific and broader market conditions 
to mitigate the prospective impact of spread tightening  we completed the repurchase of approximately million of our publicly traded long term debt during the year ended december  no fair value public debt was repurchased during the year ended december  to mitigate the impact of fair value changes on our debt due to interest rate movement  we generally enter into interest rate swaps  however  at times  we may also purchase fixed rate agency mbs to achieve this offset in interest rates 
there were no agency mbs held as of december  for this purpose 
we have historically used quotes from a third party pricing service as our primary source for valuation and have deemed such quotes as reasonable estimates of fair value by utilizing broker quotes and or institutional trading data  when available  as corroborating evidence 
secondary trading activity had begun to increase in the first quarter of and we observed continued increases in the volume and level of activity in the secondary markets through the fourth quarter of in addition  we observed issuances in the primary markets of similar securities 
because we had a sufficient amount of observable market pricing upon which to base our valuation  we utilized that data as the primary source for valuing the fixed rate debt 
given that observable market data was used  we transferred our fixed rate debt out of level as of the end of the second quarter 

table of contents overall  the financial impact of the level financial instruments did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital 
we acquired billion of certain abs from affiliates during the fourth quarter of using our existing liquidity position  and since purchasing the securities  we have received approximately billion in cash consideration from paydowns  settlements  sales  and maturities of these securities 
some fair value assets are pledged for corporate borrowings or other liquidity purposes 
most of these arrangements provide for advances to be made based on the market value and not the principal balance of the assets  and therefore whether or not we have elected fair value accounting treatment does not impact our liquidity 
if the fair value of assets posted as collateral declines  we will be required to post more collateral under our borrowing arrangements which could negatively impact our liquidity position on an overall basis 
for purposes of computing regulatory capital  mark to market adjustments related to our own creditworthiness for debt accounted for at fair value are excluded from regulatory capital 
investment in common shares of the coca cola company background we have owned common shares of coke since  when one of our predecessor institutions participated in the underwriting of coke s ipo and received common shares of coke in lieu of underwriting fees 
these shares have grown in value over the past years and have been classified as available for sale securities  with unrealized gains  net of tax  recorded as a component of shareholders equity 
because of the low accounting cost basis of these shares  we have accumulated significant unrealized gains in shareholders equity 
as of december   as a result of the transactions undertaken in discussed herein  we owned million coke shares with an accounting cost basis of  and a fair market value of approximately billion 
we commenced a comprehensive balance sheet review initiative in early in an effort to improve liquidity and capital efficiency 
as part of this initiative  we began to formally evaluate the capital efficiency of our holdings of coke common shares  as we were prohibited from including the market value of our investment in coke common shares in tier capital in accordance with federal reserve capital adequacy rules 
executed multi step strategy as we reported in connection with our financial results for the quarter ended june   we sold million coke common shares  or approximately of our holdings at that time  in an open market sale 
at that time  we also announced publicly that we were evaluating various strategies to address our remaining coke common shares 
in the second and third quarters of  we completed the following three part strategy with respect to our remaining million common shares of coke i a market sale of million shares  ii a charitable contribution of approximately million shares to the suntrust foundation and iii the execution of the agreements on million shares 
our primary objective in executing these transactions was to optimize the benefits we obtained from our long term holding of this asset  including the capital treatment by bank regulators 
i 
market sale during the second quarter of  we sold million coke common shares in the market 
these sales  which resulted in an increase of approximately million to tier capital  generated approximately million in net cash proceeds and an after tax gain of approximately million that was recorded in our financial results for the quarter ended june  this transaction resulted in foregone annual dividend income of approximately million  after tax  and gave rise to a current tax liability with a marginal rate of just over 
ii 
contribution to the suntrust foundation in july  we contributed approximately million coke common shares to the suntrust foundation  which was reflected as a contribution expense of million in our financial results for the quarter ended september  as the gain from this contribution is non taxable  the only impact to our net income was the release of the deferred tax liability of approximately million net of valuation allowance 
this contribution increased tier capital in the third quarter by approximately million 
this gain and resultant increase to tier capital were reflected in our third quarter results  as we had not made any commitments or entered into any other transactions as of june  that would have required us to record this contribution in the second quarter 
this contribution will result in foregone annual dividend income of approximately million  after tax 
we expect this contribution to act as an endowment for the suntrust foundation to make grants to charities operating within our footprint for years to come and reduce our ongoing charitable contribution expense 
this transaction was treated as a discrete item for income tax provision purposes and significantly lowered the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 
table of contents iii 
the agreements the final piece of the strategy related to the remaining million coke common shares and was executed in july we entered into the agreements  which were comprised of two variable forward agreements and share forward agreements effective july  with a major  unaffiliated financial institution the counterparty collectively covering our million coke shares 
under the agreements  we must deliver to the counterparty at settlement of the variable forward agreements either a variable number of coke common shares or a cash payment in lieu of such shares 
the counterparty is obligated to settle the agreements for no less than approximately per share  or approximately billion in the aggregate the minimum proceeds 
the share forward agreements give us the right  but not the obligation  to sell to the counterparty  at prevailing market prices at the time of settlement  any of the million coke common shares that are not delivered to the counterparty in settlement of the variable forward agreements 
the agreements effectively ensure that we will be able to sell our million coke common shares at a price no less than approximately per share  while permitting us to participate in future appreciation in the value of the coke common shares up to approximately per share and approximately per share  under each of the respective agreements 
during the terms of the agreements  and until we sell the million coke common shares  we generally will continue to receive dividends as declared and paid by coke and will have the right to vote such shares 
however  the amounts payable to us under the agreements will be adjusted if actual dividends are not equal to amounts expected at the inception of the derivative 
contemporaneously with entering into the agreements  the counterparty invested in senior unsecured promissory notes issued by suntrust bank and suntrust banks  inc collectively  the notes in a private placement in an aggregate principal amount equal to the minimum proceeds 
the notes carry stated maturities of approximately ten years from the effective date and bear interest at one month libor plus a fixed spread 
the counterparty pledged the notes to us and we pledged the million coke common shares to the counterparty  securing each entity s respective obligations under the agreements 
the pledged coke common shares are held by an independent third party custodian and the counterparty is prohibited under the agreements from selling  pledging  assigning or otherwise using the pledged coke common shares in its business 
we generally may not prepay the notes 
the interest rate on the notes will be reset upon or after the settlement of the agreements  either through a remarketing process or based upon dealer quotations 
in the event of an unsuccessful remarketing of the notes  we would be required to collateralize the notes and the maturity of the notes may accelerate to the first anniversary of the settlement of the agreements 
however  we presently believe that it is substantially certain that the notes will be successfully remarketed 
the agreements carry scheduled settlement terms of approximately seven years from the effective date 
however  we have the option to terminate the agreements earlier with the approval of the federal reserve 
the agreements may also terminate earlier upon certain events of default  extraordinary events regarding coke and other typical termination events 
upon such early termination  there could be exit costs or gains  such as certain breakage fees including an interest rate make whole amount  associated with both the agreements and the notes 
such costs or gains may be material but cannot be determined at the present time due to the unlikely occurrence of such events and the number of variables that are unknown 
however  the payment of such costs  if any  will not result in us receiving less than the minimum proceeds from the agreements 
we expect to sell all of the coke common shares upon settlement of the agreements  either under the terms of the agreements or in another market transaction 
see note  derivative financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the transactions 
the federal reserve determined that we may include in tier capital  as of the effective date of the agreements  an amount equal to the minimum proceeds minus the deferred tax liability associated with the ultimate sale of the million coke common shares 
accordingly  the agreements resulted in an increase in tier capital during the third quarter of approximately million 

table of contents deposits table composition of average deposits year ended december percent of total dollars in millions noninterest bearing now accounts money market accounts savings consumer time other time total consumer and commercial deposits brokered deposits foreign deposits total deposits average consumer and commercial deposits increased during by billion  or  compared to with the growth concentrated in noninterest bearing dda  now  and money market accounts 
the increase was partially offset by declines in savings and consumer time account balances 
during  deposits increased and our deposit mix improved as a result of our marketing efforts  pricing discipline with respect to interest bearing deposits  improving operational execution  as well as an industry wide flight to the safety of insured deposits 
consumer and commercial deposit growth is one of our key initiatives  as we focus on deposit gathering opportunities across all lines of business throughout the geographic footprint 
all regions within which we operate exhibited deposit growth during deposit growth was accomplished through a judicious use of competitive rates in select products and select geographies 
other initiatives to attract deposits included innovative product and features offerings  enhanced programs and initiatives like regional pricing  new and retention oriented money offers  more customer targeted offers  and advanced analytics that leverage product offerings with customer segmentation 
we continued to leverage the live solid

branding and marketing campaign to improve our visibility in the marketplace 
it is designed to speak to what is important to clients in the current environment and to inspire customer loyalty and capitalize on some of the opportunities presented by the new banking landscape 
notwithstanding these deposit generation successes  some of the deposit growth is due to seasonality and the economic environment 
deposit balances are expected to decline modestly in the first quarter related to seasonality  and further over time as the economy improves 
average brokered and foreign deposits decreased by billion  or  during compared to the decrease was due to our ability to grow deposits and  in turn  reduce our reliance upon wholesale funding sources 
as of december   securities pledges as collateral for deposits totaled billion 
in november  the fdic created the tlgp to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks  thrifts  and certain holding companies via its dgp  and by providing full coverage of non interest bearing deposit transaction accounts and capped now accounts  regardless of dollar amount via its tagp 
as of october   banks are no longer eligible to issue additional debt under the tlgp 
we have opted not to participate in the tagp beyond december  other short term borrowings and long term debt other short term borrowings decreased billion  or  from december  to billion at december  during november and december of  we purchased billion in three month funding under the taf in support of the federal reserve s initiative 
during the first quarter of  our core deposit growth allowed us to discontinue the use of this source of short term funding which was the primary cause for the overall decrease during the year 
long term debt decreased billion  or  from december  to billion at december  the change in long term debt was primarily the result of the repayment of billion of fhlb advances  billion of which were at fair value 
repayment was assisted by the growth during the year of our core deposit portfolio 
additionally  we repurchased approximately million of parent company junior subordinated notes and approximately million of parent company debt matured during in the first quarter of  we issued million of unsecured senior floating rate notes maturing in under the terms of the tlgp

the tier common equity  tier capital  and total capital ratios improved from   and  respectively  at december  to   and  respectively  at december  the primary drivers of the increase were the successful completion of our capital plan during the second quarter of and a billion  or  reduction in risk weighted assets 
the reduction in risk weighted assets was due primarily to the billion decline in loans held for investment 
also contributing to the reduction was a reduction in unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit during the year 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system  the federal reserve banks  the fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency completed  in may  the scap review of the potential capital needs through the end of of the nineteen largest us bank holding companies 
the federal reserve advised us that based on the scap review  we presently have and are projected to continue to have tier capital well in excess of the amount required to be well capitalized through the forecast period under both the baseline scenario and the more adverse than expected scenario more adverse as prepared by the us treasury 
the scap s more adverse scenario represented a hypothetical scenario that involves a recession that is longer and more severe than consensus expectations and results in higher than expected credit losses  but is not a forecast of expected losses or revenues 
the federal reserve advised us in may  based on the more adverse scenario  that we needed to adjust the composition of our tier capital by increasing the tier common equity portion by billion 
the additional common equity was necessary to maintain tier common equity at of risk weighted assets under the more adverse scenario  as specified by a new regulatory standard that was introduced as part of the stress test 
they also intend the additional common equity to serve as a buffer against higher losses than generally expected and to allow such bank holding companies to remain well capitalized and able to lend to creditworthy borrowers should such losses materialize 
our actual credit losses were significantly less than the projections utilized in the scap process 
as a result of the federal reserve establishing this capital target  we successfully completed a capital plan during the second quarter of that adjusted the composition of our tier capital by increasing the portion that is composed of tier common equity 
the capital plan consisted of various transactions that generated an additional billion in tier common 
table of contents equity  billion of which was raised in the second quarter 
the transactions utilized to increase our tier common equity consisted of the issuance of common stock  gains realized upon the purchase of certain of our preferred stock and hybrid debt securities  and the sale of visa class b shares 
the common stock offering raised billion in tier common equity  the purchase of hybrid debt securities created an addition to tier common equity of million  and the gain in connection with sale of the visa class b shares resulted in an addition to tier common equity of million 
while increasing our total and tier capital  the results of the common stock offering also diluted our common share count and related book value per share 
the million new shares issued in the common offering significantly contributed to the decrease from prior year end  to  in our book value per common share and the decrease from prior year end in our tangible book value per common share to at december  we declared and paid common dividends totaling million during the year ended december   or per common share  compared to billion  or per common share  during in addition  we declared dividends payable during the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively  on our series a preferred stock 
further  during the years ended december  and  we declared dividends payable of million and million  respectively  to the us treasury on the series c and d preferred stock issued to the us treasury 
during the year  we reduced the common share dividend to per share  per quarter where it remained as of the most recent common share dividend declaration in december it is not likely that we will increase our dividend until we have returned to profitability and obtained the consent of our applicable regulators as further described below 
in connection with the issuances of the series a preferred stock of suntrust banks  inc  the fixed to floating rate normal preferred purchase securities of suntrust preferred capital i  the enhanced trust preferred securities of suntrust capital viii  and the trust preferred securities of suntrust capital ix collectively  the issued securities  we entered into rccs

we executed each of the rcc in favor of the holders of certain debt securities  who are initially the holders of our subordinated notes due the rccs are more fully described in current reports on form k filed on september   november   december   and march  in connection with the issuance of the series c and d preferred stock of suntrust banks  inc we agreed to certain terms affecting repurchase  redemption  and repayment of the preferred stock and restriction on payment of common stock dividends  among other terms 
we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to increase the dividend as a result of participating in the us treasury s cpp 
generally  we may not pay a regular quarterly cash dividend more than per share of common stock prior to november   unless either i we have redeemed the series c and series d preferred stock  ii the us treasury has transferred the series c and series d preferred stock to a third party  or iii the us treasury consents to the payment of such dividends in excess of such amount 
additionally  if we increase our quarterly dividend above per share prior to the tenth anniversary of our participation in the cpp  then the exercise price and the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants issued in connection with our participation in the cpp will be proportionately adjusted 
the amount of such adjustment will be determined by a formula and depends in part on the extent to which we raise our dividend 
the formulas are contained in the warrant agreements 
there also exists limits on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to suntrust banks  inc the parent company 
substantially all of our retained earnings are undistributed earnings of the bank  which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities 
there was no capacity for payment of cash dividends to the parent company under these regulations at december  included with the issuance of the series c and d preferred stock was issuance of ten year warrants to the treasury to purchase approximately million and million shares of our common stock at initial exercise prices of and 
the preferred stock and related warrants were issued at a total discount of approximately million  which will be accreted into us treasury preferred dividend expense using the effective yield method over a five year period from each respective issuance date

to manage the major risks that we face and to provide reasonable assurance that key business objectives will be achieved  we have established an enterprise risk governance process and the suntrust enterprise risk program 
moreover  we have policies and various risk management processes designed to effectively identify  monitor and manage risk 
we continually refine and enhance our risk management policies  processes and procedures to maintain effective risk management and governance  including identification  measurement  monitoring  control  mitigation and reporting of all material risks 
over the last several years  we have enhanced risk measurement applications and systems capabilities that provide management information on whether we are being appropriately compensated for the risk profile we have adopted 
we balance our strategic goals  including revenue and profitability objectives  with the risks associated with achieving our goals 
effective risk management is an important element supporting our business decision making 

table of contents corporate risk management s focus is on synthesizing  assessing  reporting and mitigating the full set of risks at the enterprise level  and providing senior management with a holistic picture of the organization s risk profile 
we have implemented an enterprise risk management framework that has improved our ability to manage our aggregate risk profile 
at the core of the framework is our risk vision and risk mission 
risk vision to deliver sophisticated risk management capabilities that are consistent with those of top tier financial institutions and that support the needs of suntrust business units 
risk mission to measure  monitor and manage risk throughout suntrust to ensure that risk at the transaction  portfolio and institution levels is viewed consistently in order to optimize risk adjusted return decision making 
the board of directors is wholly responsible for oversight of our corporate risk governance process 
the risk committee of the board assists the board of directors in executing this responsibility 
the cro reports to the chief executive officer and is responsible for the oversight of the corporate risk management organization as well as the risk governance processes 
the cro provides overall leadership  vision and direction for our enterprise risk management framework 
in addition  the cro provides regular risk assessments to the risk committee of the board and to the full board of directors  and provides other information to executive management and the board  as requested 
the risk governance framework incorporates a variety of senior management risk related committees 
these committees are responsible for ensuring effective risk measurement and management in their respective areas of authority 
these committees include crc  alco  prac  and the suntrust enterprise risk program steering committee 
the crc is chaired by the cro and supports the cro in measuring and managing our aggregate risk profile 
the crc consists of various senior executives and meets on a monthly basis 
organizationally  we measure and oversee risk according to the three traditional risk disciplines of credit risk  market risk including liquidity risk and operational risk including compliance risk 
credit risk programs are overseen by the chief wholesale credit officer and the chief retail credit officer 
market risk programs are overseen by the chief market risk officer 
operational risk programs are overseen by the chief operational risk officer 
the three risk disciplines are overseen on a consolidated basis under our enterprise risk management framework  which also takes into consideration legal and reputation risk factors 
the suntrust enterprise risk program continues to ensure that the approach and plans for risk management are aligned to the vision and mission of corporate risk management 
in addition  the suntrust enterprise risk program s goal is to ensure our future compliance with the basel ii capital accord 
key objectives of the suntrust enterprise risk program include incorporating risk management principles that encompass our values and standards and that are designed to guide risk taking activity  maximizing performance through the balance of risk and reward and leveraging initiatives driven by regulatory requirements to deliver capabilities to better measure and manage risk 
credit risk management credit risk refers to the potential for economic loss arising from the failure of clients to meet their contractual agreements on all credit instruments  including on balance sheet exposures from loans and leases  investment securities  contingent exposures from unfunded commitments  letters of credit  credit derivatives  and counterparty risk under derivative products 
as credit risk is an essential component of many of the products and services we provide to our clients  the ability to accurately measure and manage credit risk is integral to maintain both the long run profitability of our lines of business and our capital adequacy 
the credit risk management group manages and monitors extensions of credit risk through initial underwriting processes and periodic reviews which then maintain underwriting standards in accordance with credit policies and procedures 
the corporate risk review unit conducts independent risk reviews to ensure active compliance with all policies and procedures 
credit risk management periodically reviews our lines of business to monitor asset quality trends and the appropriateness of credit policies 
in addition  total borrower exposure limits are established and concentration risk is monitored 
credit risk is partially mitigated through purchase of credit loss protection via third party insurance and use of credit derivatives such as credit default swaps 
borrower counterparty obligor risk and facility risk are evaluated using our risk rating methodology  which has been implemented in all lines of business 
we use various risk models in the estimation of expected and unexpected losses 
these models incorporate both internal and external default and loss experience 
to the extent possible  we collect internal data to ensure the validity  reliability  and accuracy of our risk models used in default and loss estimation 

table of contents we have made a commitment to maintain and enhance comprehensive credit systems in order to meet business requirements and comply with evolving regulatory standards 
as part of a continuous improvement process  credit risk management evaluates potential enhancements to our risk measurement and management tools  implementing them as appropriate along with amended credit policies and procedures 
operational risk management we face ongoing and emerging risks and regulations related to the activities that surround the delivery of banking and financial products 
coupled with external influences such as market conditions  fraudulent activities  disasters  security risks  country risk  and legal risk  the potential for operational and reputational loss has increased significantly 
we believe that effective management of operational risk defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events plays a major role in both the level and the stability of the profitability of the institution 
our operational risk management function oversees an enterprise wide framework intended to identify  assess  control  quantify  monitor  and report on operational risks company wide 
these efforts support our goals in seeking to minimize operational losses and strengthen our performance by optimizing operational capital allocation 
operational risk management is overseen by our chief operational risk officer  who reports directly to the cro 
the corporate governance structure also includes a risk manager and support staff embedded within each line of business and corporate function 
these risk managers also report indirectly to the chief operational risk officer and are responsible for execution of the operational risk management program within their areas 
market risk management market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  commodity prices  and other relevant market rates or prices 
interest rate risk  defined as the exposure of net interest income and mve to adverse movements in interest rates  is our primary market risk  and mainly arises from the structure of the balance sheet 
we are also exposed to market risk in our trading activities  coke common stock  msrs  loan warehouse and pipeline  and debt carried at fair value 
the alco meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our open positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk 
the policies established by alco are reviewed and approved by our board 
market risk from non trading activities the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk  both within policy limits approved by the board and within narrower guidelines established by alco 
these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short term and long term horizons 
the major sources of our non trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities  changes in the shape of the yield curve  and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options 
we measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models 
one of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis  which is used to model net interest income from assets  liabilities  and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures 
this analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a two year time horizon 
key assumptions in the simulation analysis and in the valuation analysis discussed below relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads  the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments 
this analysis incorporates several assumptions  the most material of which relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non contractual maturities 
as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance  we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios 
the analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates  rate shocks  basis risk analysis  and yield curve twists 
each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about client behavior in an interest rate scenario 
specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on net interest income levels and sensitivities 

table of contents the sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in net interest income due to an instantaneous basis point move in benchmark interest rates 
estimated changes set forth below are dependent upon material assumptions such as those previously discussed 
the net interest income profile reflects a fairly neutral interest rate sensitivity position with respect to an instantaneous basis point change in rates 
economic perspective rate change basis points estimated change in net interest income over months december  december  the recognition of interest rate sensitivity from an economic perspective above is different from a financial reporting perspective below due to certain interest rate swaps that are used as economic hedges for fixed rate debt 
the above profile includes the recognition of the net interest payments from these swaps  while the profile below does not include the net interest payments 
the swaps are accounted for as trading assets and therefore  the benefit to income due to a decline in short term interest rates will be recognized as a gain in the fair value of the swaps and will be recorded as an increase in trading account profits losses and commissions from a financial reporting perspective 
financial reporting perspective rate change basis points estimated change in net interest income over months december  december  the difference from december  to december  seen above in both the economic and financial reporting perspectives related to a basis point shock is primarily due to the significant decline in our higher cost fixed rate funding and brokered deposits year over year as well as a reduction in floating rate assets 
we also perform valuation analysis  which is used for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analysis 
whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon  valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions 
the valuation of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows  the net of which is referred to as mve 
the sensitivity of mve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet 
similar to the net interest income simulation  mve uses instantaneous changes in rates 
mve values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model 
as with the net interest income simulation model  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the mve analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios 
as of december   the mve profile indicates modest changes with respect to an instantaneous basis point change in rates 
rate shock basis points estimated change in mve december  december  while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario  we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact 
since mve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments  the change in mve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon ie  the current fiscal year 
further  mve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth  changes in product mix  changes in 
table of contents yield curve relationships  and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates 
the net interest income simulation and valuation analyses do not include actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates 
trading activities trading instruments are used as part of our overall balance sheet management strategies and to support client requirements through our broker dealer subsidiary 
product offerings to clients include debt securities  loans traded in the secondary market  equity securities  derivatives and foreign exchange contracts  and similar financial instruments 
other trading activities include acting as a market maker in certain debt and equity securities and related derivatives 
typically  we maintain a securities inventory to facilitate client transactions 
also in the normal course of business  we assume a limited degree of market risk in hedging strategies 
we have developed policies and procedures to manage market risk associated with trading  capital markets and foreign exchange activities using a var approach that determines total exposure arising from interest rate risk  equity risk  foreign exchange risk  spread risk  and volatility risk 
for trading portfolios  var measures the estimated maximum loss from a trading position  given a specified confidence level and time horizon 
var exposures and actual results are monitored daily for each trading portfolio 
our var calculation measures the potential losses using a confidence level with a one day holding period 
this means that  on average  losses are expected to exceed var two or three times per year 
we had zero backtest exceptions to our overall var during the last twelve months 
the following table displays high  low  and average var for the years ended december  and dollars in millions average var high var low var the lower average var during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily due to sales  paydowns and maturities of acquired illiquid assets 
trading assets net of trading liabilities averaged billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
trading assets net of trading liabilities were billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
declines in average and ending trading assets net of trading liabilities is primarily due to balance sheet management activities and the reduction in acquired illiquid assets 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost 
we mitigate this risk by attempting to structure our balance sheet prudently and by maintaining diverse borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs 
for example  we structure our balance sheet so that we fund less liquid assets  such as loans  with stable funding sources  such as retail deposits  long term debt  wholesale deposits  and capital 
we assess liquidity needs arising from asset growth  maturing obligations  and deposit withdrawals  considering operations in both the normal course of business and times of unusual events 
in addition  we consider our off balance sheet arrangements and commitments that may impact liquidity in certain business environments 
our alco measures liquidity risks  sets policies to manage these risks  and reviews adherence to those policies at its monthly meetings 
for example  we manage the use of short term unsecured borrowings as well as total wholesale funding through policies established and reviewed by alco 
in addition  the risk committee of our board sets liquidity limits and reviews current and forecasted liquidity positions at each of its regularly scheduled meetings 
we have contingency funding plans that assess liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events such as credit rating downgrades  rapid asset growth  and financial market disruptions 
our contingency plans also provide for continuous monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of contingent liquidity 
these sources of contingent liquidity include capacity to borrow at the federal reserve discount window and from the fhlb system and the ability to sell  pledge or borrow against unencumbered securities in the bank s investment portfolio 
as of december   the potential liquidity from these three sources totaled billion an amount we believe exceeds any contingent liquidity needs 
uses of funds 
our primary uses of funds include the extension of loans and credit  the purchase of investment securities  working capital  and debt and capital service 
in addition  contingent uses of funds may arise from events such as financial market disruptions or credit rating downgrades 
factors that affect our credit ratings include  but are not limited to  the credit risk profile of our assets  the adequacy of our loan loss reserves  earnings  the liquidity profile of both the bank and the parent company  the economic environment  particularly related to our markets  and the adequacy of our capital base 

table of contents the bank and the parent company experienced credit rating downgrades from moody s  s p  and fitch during the first half of as of december   the senior  long term debt ratings for the bank were a  a and a from moody s  s p and fitch  respectively 
the comparable senior  long term debt ratings for the parent company as of december  were baa  bbb and a 
the bank s corresponding short term ratings were p  a  and f moody s  s p and fitch  while the parent company s short term ratings were p  a and f  respectively 
s p s april downgrade of the bank s short term credit rating from a to a materially impacted some of our business activities 
the activities most affected were two off balance sheet businesses our abcp conduit  three pillars  and our vrdo remarketing operation  both of which depend upon the support of investors who primarily purchase obligations rated a or equivalent 
the bank and the parent company have purchased certain amounts of three pillars overnight cp at estimated market rates  on a discretionary and non contractual basis see note  certain transfers of financial assets  mortgage servicing rights and variable interest entities  in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we did not own any of the outstanding three pillars cp as of december  we conduct remarketing of municipal securities known as vrdos 
the terms of the vrdos allow investors to put or tender the securities for repayment prior to maturity 
the bank backs most of these securities with letters of credit that provide liquidity in the event of this early repayment 
after the s p downgrade in april  a substantial portion of our vrdo investors tendered their bonds for repayment  which required the bank to provide liquidity by funding the letters of credit backing the tendered vrdos 
the bank s contingency funding plans anticipated this potential use of liquidity  and the bank secured ample liquidity for the vrdo program as the funded loans came on to our balance sheet 
as the year came to a close  this use of bank liquidity declined as investor demand for remarketed vrdos increased and vrdo clients were able to find alternative sources of funding 
the bank and the parent company borrow in the money markets using instruments such as fed funds  eurodollars  or cp 
lenders in these unsecured instruments extend credit lines to borrowers based in large part upon the borrower s credit ratings from the three large nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations 
after the s p downgrade in april  the bank experienced a decrease in its available credit lines which reduced its depth of access and slightly increased its cost of borrowing in these instruments 
the bank s conservative liquidity profile and prudent liquidity management greatly mitigated the impact of the downgrade on its daily money markets funding activities and costs 
during the fourth quarter  the parent company had no cp outstanding and the bank was a net lender into short term money markets 
on february   s p downgraded our senior  long term debt bank and parent company ratings from a and bbb  respectively  to bbb and bbb  respectively 
our short term ratings remained unchanged at a s p cited expectations of continued stress in and high exposure to residential mortgages  especially in florida  as the primary factor in its decision to downgrade our long term ratings 
however  concurrent with the downgrade  s p changed the outlook on our credit ratings to stable noting our strong franchise  good liquidity and funding profile  and commercial loan portfolio performance that was in line with their expectations 
our business activities have not been materially impacted as a result of this recent downgrade by s p 
sources of funds 
our primary sources of funds include a large  stable retail deposit base 
core deposits  primarily gathered from our retail branch network  are our largest and most cost effective source of funding 
during  the bank experienced strong core deposit growth 
core deposits totaled billion as of december   up from billion as of december  the bank used core deposit growth to replace short term wholesale funding  contributing to the bank s strong liquidity position 
we also maintain access to a diversified base of wholesale funding sources 
these uncommitted sources include fed funds purchased from other banks  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  negotiable certificates of deposit  offshore deposits  fhlb advances  global bank notes  and cp 
aggregate wholesale funding totaled billion as of december  reduced from billion as of december  net short term unsecured borrowings  which includes wholesale domestic and foreign deposits and fed funds purchased  totaled billion as of december   down from billion as of december  an additional source of wholesale liquidity is our access to the capital markets 
the parent company maintains an sec shelf registration statement from which it may issue senior or subordinated notes  and various capital securities such as common or preferred stock 
the current shelf allows the parent company to issue up to billion of such securities 
the bank maintains a global bank note program under which it may issue senior or subordinated debt with various terms 
as of december   the bank had capacity to issue billion of notes under the global bank note program 
borrowings under these programs are designed to appeal primarily to domestic and international institutional investors 
institutional investor demand for these securities is dependent upon numerous factors  including but not limited to our credit ratings and investor perception of financial market conditions and the health of the banking sector 
our capacity under these programs refers to authorization granted by our board  and does not refer to a commitment to purchase by any investor 

table of contents parent company liquidity 
we measure parent company liquidity by comparing sources of liquidity from short term assets  such as unencumbered and other investment securities and cash  relative to short term liabilities  which include overnight sweep funds  seasoned long term debt  and cp 
as of december   the parent company had billion in such sources compared to short term debt of billion 
as of december   the parent company also had approximately billion in us treasury securities that were purchased in the fourth quarter of in anticipation of repayment of tarp 
we also manage the parent company s liquidity by structuring its maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time 
approximately million of parent company debt matured in october and million is scheduled to mature during much of the parent company s liabilities are long term in nature  coming from the proceeds of our capital securities and long term senior and subordinated notes 
the primary uses of parent company liquidity include debt service  dividends on capital instruments  the periodic purchase of investment securities  and loans to our subsidiaries 
we believe the parent company holds ample cash to satisfy these working capital needs 
we fund corporate dividends primarily with dividends from our banking subsidiary 
we are subject to both state and federal banking regulations that limit our ability to pay common stock dividends in certain circumstances 
in the context of the recent economic recession and credit market turmoil  we reduced our quarterly common stock dividend 
effective for the quarterly dividend paid in september  the common stock dividend was per share 
it is not likely that we will increase our quarterly dividend until we have returned to profitability and obtained the consent from our applicable regulators 
recent market and regulatory developments 
financial market conditions remained under a state of stress during much of as a result  the federal banking regulatory agencies reviewed the nineteen largest us banks pursuant to the scap  which is discussed in greater detail in the capital resources section of this md a 
pursuant to the scap results  we executed several transactions as part of a formalized capital plan approved by the federal reserve that increased tier common equity by billion and incidentally raised liquidity at both the parent company and the bank 
the transactions included the sale of billion of common stock  a million cash tender for certain hybrid debt securities  and the sale of various corporate assets 
the sale of additional shares of common stock  through both at the market and marketed offerings  provided substantial additional long term liquidity to the parent company 
the purchase of hybrid debt securities used approximately million of parent company liquidity since these hybrid securities were obligations of the parent company 
the net effect of these capital actions was to increase parent company liquidity by approximately billion 
moreover  the aforementioned asset sales also generated billion of liquidity at the bank 
other liquidity considerations 
as detailed in table  we had an aggregate potential obligation of billion to our clients in unused lines of credit at december  commitments to extend credit are arrangements to lend to clients who have complied with predetermined contractual obligations 
we also had billion in letters of credit as of december   most of which are standby letters of credit  which require that we provide funding if certain future events occur 
our lines and letters of credit have declined since december  due to our decision to reduce exposure to certain higher risk areas  as well as due to clients decision not to renew their lines and letters of credit as a result of their decreased need for these facilities as they pay down their debt and reduce their need for working capital 
approximately billion of these letters as of december  supported vrdos  as previously discussed 
in addition  at december   lines of credit totaling approximately billion supported cp issued by three pillars to investors not affiliated with us or three pillars 
no amounts are currently outstanding related to three pillars lines of credit 
for more information about three pillars  see note  certain transfers of financial assets  mortgage servicing rights and variable interest entities  to the consolidated financial statements 
in the third quarter of  the fdic  in response to the need to replenish dif balances that declined as a result of recent bank failures  announced details of a plan to restore dif balances 
the restoration plan  as subsequently approved  required all fdic insured banks to prepay their risk based assessments for the years   and the assessments  usually due quarterly  were instead required to be estimated for the three future years and paid prior to december  in conjunction with the adoption of this rule  the fdic also approved a three basis point increase in assessment rates effective on january  our estimate of three future years of assessments under this restoration plan was million with the estimated assessment for calculated at current rates 
we paid that assessment to the fdic on december  and concurrently recorded a prepaid asset in that amount within other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
we anticipate funding any differences between our prepayment and actual amounts due each quarter using our existing available liquidity 
certain provisions of long term debt agreements and the lines of credit prevent us from creating liens on  disposing of  or issuing except to related parties voting stock of subsidiaries 
further  there are restrictions on mergers  consolidations  certain leases  sales or transfers of assets  and minimum shareholders equity ratios 
as of december   we were and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants and provisions of these debt agreements 
as of december   our cumulative utbs amounted to million 
interest related to utbs was million as of december  these utbs represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax 
table of contents returns and the benefits recognized and measured in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes 
the utbs are based on various tax positions in several jurisdictions and  if taxes related to these positions are ultimately paid  the payments would be made from our normal  operating cash flows  likely over multiple years 
table unfunded lending commitments dollars in millions december december unused lines of credit commercial mortgage commitments home equity lines commercial real estate commercial paper conduit credit card total unused lines of credit letters of credit financial standby performance standby commercial total letters of credit includes billion and billion in irlcs accounted for as derivatives as of december  and december   respectively 
other market risk other sources of market risk include the risk associated with holding residential and commercial mortgage loans prior to selling them into the secondary market  commitments to clients to make mortgage loans that will be sold to the secondary market  and our investment in msrs 
we manage the risks associated with the residential and commercial mortgage loans classified as held for sale ie  the warehouse and our irlcs on residential loans intended for sale 
the warehouses and irlcs consist primarily of fixed and adjustable rate single family residential and commercial real estate loans 
the risk associated with the warehouses and irlcs is the potential change in interest rates between the time the customer locks in the rate on the anticipated loan and the time the loan is sold on the secondary market  which is typically days 
we manage interest rate risk predominantly with interest rate swaps  futures  and forward sale agreements  where the changes in value of the instruments substantially offset the changes in value of the warehouse and the irlcs 
the irlcs on residential mortgage loans intended for sale are classified as free standing derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedge accounting relationships 
msrs are the present value of future net cash flows that are expected to be received from the mortgage servicing portfolio 
the value of msrs is highly dependent upon the assumed prepayment speed of the mortgage servicing portfolio which is driven by the level of certain key interest rates  primarily the year current coupon par mortgage rate known as the par mortgage rate 
future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in the mortgage servicing portfolio would not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated 
given the current economic environment  the level of prepayments has slowed 
we historically have not actively hedged msrs  but have managed the market risk through our overall asset liability management process with consideration to the natural counter cyclicality of servicing and production that occurs as interest rates rise and fall over time with the economic cycle as well as with securities available for sale 
however  as of january   we designated the msrs vintage and all future msrs production at fair value 
in addition  as of january   we designated at fair value the remaining msr portfolio being carried at locom 
upon designating the remaining msrs at fair value  we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment increase in retained earnings  net of taxes  of million

relative to the fair value portion of our retained msrs  we designated million at january  and added million of new production during we recorded an increase in fair value of million for the year ended december   including decay resulting from the realization of expected monthly net servicing cash flows 
the msrs being carried at fair value total million as of december  and are managed within established risk limits 
table of contents and are monitored as part of various governance processes 
we recorded losses in the consolidated statements of income loss related to fair value msrs of million for year ended december   inclusive of the mark to market adjustments on the related hedges 
relative to the locom portion of our retained msrs  an impairment recovery gain was recorded in the consolidated statements of income loss of million during as of december   we held million of locom msrs with a fair value of million 
as discussed above  this class of msrs was designated at fair value as of january  we also have market risk from capital stock we hold in the fhlb of atlanta and cincinnati and from capital stock we hold in the federal reserve bank 
in order to be an fhlb member  we are required to purchase capital stock in the fhlb 
in exchange  members take advantage of competitively priced advances as a wholesale funding source and access grants and low cost loans for affordable housing and community development projects  amongst other benefits 
as of december   we held a total of million of capital stock in the fhlb 
during  we reduced our capital stock holdings in the fhlb by million 
in order to become a member of the federal reserve system  regulations require that we hold a certain amount of capital stock as a percentage of the bank s capital 
during  we held million of federal reserve bank capital stock

we also hold  as of december   a total of approximately million of private equity investments that include direct investments and limited partnerships 
we hold these investments as long term investments and make additional contributions based on our contractual commitments but have decided to limit investments into new private equity investments

interest related to utbs was million as of december  we are under continuous examination by various tax authorities 
we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict  with respect to periods for which the statutes of limitations are open  the amount of tax and interest if any that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment 
it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority 

table of contents critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in detail in note  significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements and are integral to understanding md a 
we have identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require our judgment about matters that are highly uncertain and different estimates that could be reasonably applied would result in materially different assessments with respect to ascertaining the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments  and contingencies 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset  valuing an asset or liability  or reducing a liability 
our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with us gaap  and they conform to general practices within the financial services industry 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a description of our current critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan and lease losses the alll represents our estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the alll is increased by the provision for credit losses and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the alll is determined based on our review and evaluation of larger loans that meet our definition of impairment and the current risk characteristics of pools of homogeneous loans ie  loans having similar characteristics within the loan portfolio and our assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data 
larger nonaccrual loans and certain consumer  commercial  and commercial real estate loans whose terms have been modified in a tdr  are individually evaluated to determine the amount of specific allowance required using the most probable source of repayment  including the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows  the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs of disposition  or the loan s estimated market value 
in these measurements  we use assumptions and methodologies that are relevant to estimating the level of impaired and unrealized losses in the portfolio 
to the extent that the data supporting such assumptions has limitations  our judgment and experience play a key role in enhancing the specific alll estimates 
key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses include internal risk ratings  market and collateral values  discount rates  loss rates  and our view of current economic conditions 
general allowances are established for loans and leases grouped into pools that have similar characteristics  including smaller balance homogeneous loans 
the alll committee estimates probable losses by evaluating quantitative and qualitative factors  including net charge off trends  internal risk ratings  loss forecasts  collateral values  geographic location  borrower fico scores  delinquency rates  nonperforming and restructured loans  origination channel  product mix  underwriting practices  industry conditions  and economic trends 
our financial results are affected by the changes in and the absolute level of the alll 
this process involves our analysis of complex internal and external variables  and it requires that we exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate alll 
as a result of the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity  we cannot assure the precision of the amount reserved  should we experience sizeable loan or lease losses in any particular period 
for example  changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  or the condition of various markets in which collateral may be sold could require us to significantly decrease or increase the level of the alll 
such an adjustment could materially affect net income as a result of the change in provision for credit losses 
during and  we experienced increases in delinquencies and net charge offs in residential real estate loans due to the deterioration of the housing market 
the alll considered these market conditions in deriving the estimated alll  however  given the continued economic difficulties  the ultimate amount of loss could vary from that estimate 
for additional discussion of the alll see the provision for credit losses  allowance for loan and lease losses  and nonperforming assets sections in this md a 
estimates of fair value certain of our assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
the extent to which we use fair value on a recurring basis was significantly expanded upon the election to begin to carry certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value beginning in examples of recurring uses of fair value include derivative instruments  available for sale and trading securities  certain held for investment and held for sale loans  certain issuances of long term debt  certain classes of the msr asset  and residual interests from company sponsored securitizations 
we also measure certain assets at fair value on a non recurring basis either when such assets are carried at the locom  to evaluate assets for impairment  or for disclosure purposes 
examples of these non recurring uses of fair value include certain lhfs and msrs accounted for at the locom  oreo  goodwill  intangible assets  nonmarketable equity securities  and long lived assets 
depending on the nature of the asset or liability  we use various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value 

table of contents fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
estimating fair value requires that we make a number of significant judgments 
where observable market prices for identical assets or liabilities are not available  we identify what we believe to be similar assets or liabilities 
if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain for any such similar assets or liabilities  then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques  such as discounted cash flow analyses 
these modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability  including market based assumptions  such as interest rates  as well as assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique  the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset  market liquidity  and the risk of nonperformance 
in certain cases  our assessments with respect to assumptions that market participants would make may be inherently difficult to determine and the use of different assumptions could result in material changes to these fair value measurements 
various processes and controls have been adopted to determine that appropriate methodologies  techniques and assumptions are used in the development of fair value estimates 
these processes include independent price verification  model validation  and corroborating prices from third parties when possible 
the use of significant  unobservable inputs in our models is described in note  fair value election and measurement  to the consolidated financial statements 
in certain instances  we use discount rates in our determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities such as retirement and other postretirement benefit obligations  msrs  and certain financial instruments 
discount rates used are those considered to be commensurate with the risks involved 
a change in these discount rates could increase or decrease the values of those assets and liabilities 
the fair value of msrs is based on discounted cash flow analyses 
we provide disclosure of the key economic assumptions used to measure msrs and residual interests and a sensitivity analysis to adverse changes to these assumptions in note  certain transfers of financial assets  mortgage servicing rights and variable interest entities  to the consolidated financial statements 
a detailed discussion of key variables  including the discount rate  used in the determination of retirement and other postretirement obligations is contained in the pension accounting section below 
in estimating the fair values for investment securities and most derivative financial instruments  we believe that observable market prices are the best evidence of exit price 
if such market prices are not available on the exact securities that we own  fair values are based on the market prices of similar instruments  third party broker quotes or are estimated using industry standard or proprietary models whose inputs may be unobservable 
the distressed market conditions associated with this economic recession have impacted our ability to obtain market pricing data for certain of our investments 
even when market pricing has been available  the reduced trading activity resulting from current market conditions has challenged the observability of these quotations 
when fair values are estimated based on internal models  we will consider relevant market indices that correlate to the underlying collateral  along with assumptions such as liquidity discounts  interest rates  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity rates  and discount rates 
the fair values of loans held for investment recorded at fair value and lhfs are based on observable current market prices in the secondary loan market in which loans trade  as either whole loans or as abs 
when securities prices are obtained in the secondary loan market  we will translate these prices into whole loan prices by incorporating adjustments for estimated credit enhancement costs  loan servicing fees  and various other transformation costs  when material 
the fair value of a loan is impacted by the nature of the asset and the market liquidity 
when estimating fair value for loans that do not trade in an active market  we will make assumptions about prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity rates  and liquidity discounts 
absent comparable current market data  we believe that the fair value derived from these various approaches is a reasonable approximation of the prices that we would receive upon sale of the loans 
the fair values of oreo and other repossessed assets are typically determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information  less estimated selling costs 
estimates of fair value are also required when performing an impairment analysis of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets 
for long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization  an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
in determining the fair value  management uses models which require assumptions about growth rates  the life of the asset  and or the market value of the assets 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill in  our reporting units were comprised of retail  commercial  commercial real estate  mortgage  corporate and investment banking  wealth and investment management  and affordable housing 
we changed our business segments in among other changes  we combined the consumer lending business unit with the mortgage reporting unit and renamed the combined unit as household lending  previously consumer lending was included in the retail reporting unit 
see note  business segment reporting to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the changes to our reportable segments 

table of contents we review the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis  or more often  if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity 
the goodwill impairment analysis estimates the fair value of equity using discounted cash flow analyses which require assumptions  as well as guideline company and guideline transaction information  where available 
the inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations including projections of future cash flows  discount rates  the fair value of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  and applicable valuation multiples based on the guideline information 
we assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the reporting units by giving consideration to our market capitalization over a reasonable period of time  however  due to the significant and unprecedented volatility in market capitalization of the financial institution s sector  supplemental information is applied based on observable multiples from guideline transactions  adjusting to reflect our specific factors  as well as current market conditions 
based on our latest annual impairment analysis of goodwill  we believe that the fair value for all reporting units is substantially in excess of the respective reporting unit s carrying value  with the exception of corporate and investment banking which had a fair value that exceeded carrying value by 
valuation techniques in determining the fair value of our reporting units  we primarily use discounted cash flow analyses  which require assumptions about short and long term net cash flow growth rates for each reporting unit  as well as discount rates 
in addition  we apply guideline company and guideline transaction information  where available  to aid in the valuation of certain reporting units 
the guideline information is based on publicly available information 
a valuation multiple is selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compares the reporting unit s benchmark result with the guideline information 
in addition to these financial considerations  qualitative factors such as asset quality  growth opportunities  and overall risk are considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple used to estimate a value on a minority basis 
a control premium of is applied to the minority basis value to arrive at the reporting unit s estimated fair value on a controlling basis 
the values separately derived from each valuation technique ie  discounted cash flow  guideline company  guideline transaction  and asset accumulation are used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting unit s fair value 
the discounted cash flow approach is generally weighted and the market based approaches are generally weighted 
the weightings may be adjusted based on the degree of relevant market based information 
the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value 
judgment is applied in determining the selection and weightings that are most representative of fair value 
growth assumptions multi year financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives  client service and retention standards  market share changes  anticipated loan and deposit growth  forward interest rates  historical performance  and industry and economic trends  among other considerations 
the long term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was estimated at in based on management s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit  as well as broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product and inflation 
discount rate assumptions discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model  which considers the risk free interest rate  market risk premium  beta  and in some cases  unsystematic risk and size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit 
the sum of the reporting units cash flow projections are used to calculate an overall implied internal rate of return 
the implied internal rate of return serves as a baseline for estimating the specific discount rate for each reporting unit 
the discount rates are also calibrated based on the assessment of the risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit 
in  the discount rates ranged from to as a result of the economic environment causing market dislocation and lower valuation multiples 
estimated fair value and sensitivities the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is derived from the valuation techniques described above 
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is analyzed in relation to numerous market and historical factors  including current economic and market conditions  recent  historical  and implied stock price volatility  marketplace dynamics such as level of short selling  company specific growth opportunities  and an implied control premium 
the implied control premium is determined by comparing the aggregate fair value of the reporting units to our market capitalization  measured over a reasonable period of time 
we assess the reasonableness of the implied control premium in relation to the market and historical factors previously mentioned  as well as recognizing that the size of the implied control premium is not  independently  a determinative measure to assess the estimated fair values of the reporting units 

table of contents economic and market conditions can vary significantly which may cause increased volatility in a company s stock price  resulting in a temporary decline in market capitalization 
in those circumstances  current market capitalization may not be an accurate indication of a market participant s estimate of entity specific value measured over a reasonable period of time 
we believe that this volatility may be tied to market sentiment pertaining to the overall banking sector and concerns regarding dilution of common shareholders  rather than the result of company specific adjustments to cash flows  guideline multiples  or asset values which would have influenced the fair value of reporting units 
as a result  the use of market capitalization has become a less relevant measure to assess the reasonableness of the aggregate value of the reporting units 
therefore  we supplement the market capitalization information with other observable market information that provided benchmark valuation multiples from transactions over the last year and a half 
these multiples allow us to estimate an aggregate purchase value and implied premium based on current market conditions and the estimated net asset fair value for suntrust 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions  therefore  in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value 
we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values 
ultimately  future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value 
additionally  a reporting unit s carrying value of equity could change based on market conditions and the risk profile of those reporting units 
in those situations where the carrying value of equity exceeds the estimated fair value  an additional goodwill impairment evaluation is performed which involves calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill is recognized in a business combination 
the fair value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  including previously unrecognized intangible assets  is individually determined 
significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets is the implied goodwill 
the value of the implied goodwill is highly sensitive to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit s net assets 
the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets is estimated using a variety of valuation techniques including the following recent data observed in the market  including similar assets cash flow modeling based on projected cash flows and market discount rates market indices estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral price indications from independent third parties observable market information is utilized to the extent available and relevant 
the estimated fair values reflect management s assumptions regarding how a market participant would value the net assets and includes appropriate credit  liquidity  and market risk premiums that are indicative of the current environment 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the goodwill for the respective reporting unit  no goodwill impairment is recorded 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
changes in the estimated fair value of the individual assets and liabilities may result in a different amount of implied goodwill  and ultimately the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the potential ranges of implied goodwill 
the size of the implied goodwill is significantly affected by the estimated fair value of loans 
the estimated fair value of a loan portfolio is based on an exit price  and the assumptions used are intended to approximate those that a market participant would use in valuing the loans in an orderly transaction  including a market liquidity discount 
the significant market risk premium that is a consequence of distressed market conditions is a significant contributor to valuation discounts associated with loans 
future changes in the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets could result in future goodwill impairment 
for example  to the extent that market liquidity returns and the fair value of the individual assets of a reporting unit increases at a faster rate than the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  that may cause the implied goodwill of a reporting unit to be lower than the carrying value of goodwill  resulting in goodwill impairment 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and estimate income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions 
the estimated income tax expense benefit is reported in the consolidated statements of income loss 
the evaluation pertaining to the tax expense and related tax asset and liability balances involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity around the ultimate measurement and resolution of these matters 

table of contents accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future and are reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent and other pertinent information and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation 
changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax laws  the status of examinations by the tax authorities and newly enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits of tax positions 
these changes  when they occur  impact accrued taxes and can materially affect our operating results 
we regularly evaluate our uncertain tax positions and estimate the appropriate level of utbs related to each of these positions 
during the fourth quarter  we moved from a net deferred tax liability to a net deferred tax asset of million 
we regularly evaluate the realizability of deferred tax asset positions 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary  we consider the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws  as well as estimates of future pre tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would  if necessary  be implemented 
we currently maintain a valuation allowance for certain state nols generated by our subsidiaries 
we expect to realize our remaining deferred tax assets over the allowable carryback and or carryforward periods 
therefore  no valuation allowance is deemed necessary against our federal or remaining state deferred tax assets as of december  however  if an unanticipated event occurred that materially changed pre tax and taxable income in future periods  an increase in the valuation allowance may become necessary

pension accounting several variables affect the annual variability of cost for our retirement programs 
the main variables are size and characteristics of the employee population  discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  recognition of actual asset returns  other actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost 
below is a brief description of these variables and the effect they have on our pension costs 
size and characteristics of the employee population pension cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plans  and other factors including salary  age  years of employment  and benefit terms 
effective january   retirement plan participants who were employed as of december  ceased to accrue additional benefits under the existing pension benefit formula and their accrued benefits were frozen 
beginning january   participants who had fewer than years of service and future participants accrue future pension benefits under a cash balance formula that provides compensation and interest credits to a personal pension account 
participants with or more years of service as of december  were given the opportunity to choose between continuing a traditional pension benefit accrual under a reduced formula or participating in the new personal pension account 
discount rate the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations 
the discount rate for each plan is determined by matching the expected cash flows of each plan to a yield curve based on long term  high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date  december  the discount rate for each plan is reset annually or upon occurrence of a triggering event on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions 
if we were to assume a increase decrease in the discount rate for all retirement and other postretirement plans  and keep all other assumptions constant  the benefit cost would decrease increase by approximately million 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on historical experience  market projections  and the target asset allocation set forth in the investment policy for the retirement plans  the pre tax expected rate of return on plan assets was for and for this expected rate of return is dependent upon the asset allocation decisions made with respect to plan assets 
annual differences  if any  between expected and actual returns are included in the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount 
we generally amortize any unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in excess of a corridor in net periodic pension expense over the average future service of active employees  which is approximately seven years  or average future lifetime for plans with no active participants that are frozen 
see note  employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 
if we were to assume a increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return for the retirement and other postretirement plans  holding all other actuarial assumptions constant  the benefit cost would decrease increase by approximately million 

table of contents recognition of actual asset returns accounting guidance allows for the use of an asset value that smoothes investment gains and losses over a period up to five years 
however  we have elected to use a preferable method in determining pension cost 
this method uses the actual market value of the plan assets 
therefore  we will experience more variability in the annual pension cost  as the asset values will be more volatile than companies who elected to smooth their investment experience 
other actuarial assumptions to estimate the projected benefit obligation  actuarial assumptions are required about factors such as mortality rate  turnover rate  retirement rate  disability rate  and the rate of compensation increases 
these factors do not tend to change significantly over time  so the range of assumptions  and their impact on pension cost  is generally limited 
we annually review the assumptions used based on historical and expected future experience 
the interest crediting rate applied to each personal pension account was an annual effective rate of from january  through june  and from july  through december  healthcare cost assumed healthcare cost trend rates also have an impact on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 
due to changing medical inflation  it is important to understand the effect of a one percent change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates 
if we were to assume a one percent increase in healthcare cost trend rates  the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be a million and million increase  respectively 
if we were to assume a one percent decrease in healthcare trend rates  the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be a million and million decrease  respectively 
to estimate the projected benefit obligation as of december   we projected forward the benefit obligations from january  to december   adjusting for benefit payments  expected growth in the benefit obligations  changes in key assumptions and plan provisions  and any significant changes in the plan demographics that occurred during the year  including where appropriate subsidized early retirements  salary changes different from expectations  entrance of new participants  changes in per capita claims cost  medicare part d subsidy  and retiree contributions
