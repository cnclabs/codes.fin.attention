gathering  processing and marketing sales gathering  processing and marketing expenses margin for the year ended december   gathering  processing and marketing margin decreased million 
the decrease was primarily due to lower prices for natural gas  ngls and condensate  which led to reduced gas processing margins  lower margins associated with firm transportation contracts due to price differentials between supply and market areas  and unrealized losses on derivatives related to gas storage activity which is seasonal in nature  ie  the margin realized on the future sale of stored volumes covered by these derivative instruments will more than offset the recorded unrealized losses 
these amounts were partially offset by increases in crude oil marketing margins  and in ngls marketing margins primarily due to inventory write downs to market value taken in the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   gathering  processing and marketing margin decreased million 
the decrease resulted from lower marketing sales of million primarily due to lower margins on firm transportation contracts and decreased third party marketing activity  a write down of storage inventory due to lower commodity prices in the fourth quarter of and lower gathering and processing sales of million  primarily due to lower volumes as a result of the divestitures

operating results segment analysis adjusted ebitdax to assess the operating results of anadarko s segments  the chief operating decision maker analyzes income from continuing operations before income taxes  interest expense  exploration expense  dd a expense and impairments  less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests adjusted ebitdax 
anadarko s definition of adjusted ebitdax  which is not a gaap measure  excludes exploration expense because exploration expense is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period 
however  exploration expense is monitored by management as part of costs incurred in exploration and development activities 
similarly  dd a expense and impairments are excluded from adjusted ebitdax as a measure of segment operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred 
the company s definition of adjusted ebitdax also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to anadarko s financing methods or capital structure 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitdax provides information useful in assessing the company s financial condition and results of operations and that adjusted ebitdax is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and make distributions to stockholders 
adjusted ebitdax  as defined by anadarko  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
therefore  anadarko s consolidated adjusted ebitdax should be considered in conjunction with income loss from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders and other performance measures prepared in accordance with gaap  such as operating income or cash flow from operating activities 
adjusted ebitdax has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect income from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders and net cash provided by operating activities 
adjusted ebitdax should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of anadarko s results as reported under gaap

proved reserves anadarko focuses on growth and profitability 
reserve replacement is a key to growth 
future profitability depends partially upon the cost of finding and developing oil and gas reserves 
reserve growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling  improved recovery or acquisition of producing properties 
the following is a discussion of proved reserves  reserve additions and revisions and future net cash flows from proved reserves 
additional reserve information is contained in the supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities supplemental information under item of this form k 
mmboe proved reserves beginning of year reserve additions and revisions sales in place production end of year proved developed reserves beginning of year end of year reserve additions and revisions during  the company added mmboe of proved reserves as a result of additions purchases in place  discoveries and extensions and revisions 
the company expects the majority of future reserve growth to come from positive revisions associated with infill drilling and extensions of current fields and new discoveries onshore in north america and the deepwaters of the gulf of mexico  as well as through improved recovery operations  purchases of proved properties in strategic areas and successful exploration in international growth areas 
the success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future 
additions during  anadarko added mmboe of proved reserves primarily as the result of successful drilling in the united states and at international locations 
the company also acquired mmboe of proved reserves in place related to onshore domestic assets in during  anadarko added mmboe of proved reserves primarily as the result of successful drilling in the rockies and development and appraisal wells in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
during  anadarko added mmboe of proved reserves 
of this amount  mmboe were a result of successful drilling in cbm and conventional plays of the rockies and the initial recognition of proved reserves at the peregrino field offshore brazil 
revisions total revisions in were mmboe or of the beginning of year reserve base 
the revisions included an increase of mmboe primarily related to large onshore natural gas plays  such as the greater natural buttes and pinedale fields  as a result of successful infill drilling where the reserve bookings for the infill wells are treated as a positive revision 
the revisions include a decrease of mmboe driven by lower natural gas prices 
total revisions in were mmboe or of the beginning of year reserve base 
the revisions included an increase of mmboe primarily related to greater natural buttes  wattenberg and pinedale fields  as a result of successful infill drilling  and positive revisions to the peregrino heavy oil field  offshore brazil  which was sold in  partially offset by a decrease of mmboe related to prices for oil and ngls

discounted future net cash flows at december   the discounted at estimated future net cash flow from anadarko s proved reserves was billion stated in accordance with the new regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec and the financial accounting standards board fasb 
this discounted future net cash flow was calculated based on beginning of month average prices for the year  held flat for the life of the reserves  adjusted for any contractual provisions 
for reporting periods prior to december   year end prices were used for calculating discounted future net cash flows 
the increase of billion or in compared to is primarily due to positive performance from exploration and development programs

under the terms of the rca  the company can  under certain conditions  request an increase in the borrowing capacity under the rca up to a total available credit amount of billion 
anadarko was in compliance with existing covenants and the full amount of the rca was available for borrowing at december  the company continuously monitors its leverage position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedule 
the company will continue to monitor the financial markets and evaluate funding alternatives  including property divestitures  borrowings under the company s rca and the issuance of debt or equity securities  based on its capital requirements 
to facilitate a potential debt or equity securities issuance  the company has the ability to sell securities under its shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august the following section discusses significant sources and uses of cash for the three year period ending december  forward looking information related to the company s liquidity and capital resources are discussed in outlook that follows 
sources of cash operating activities anadarko s cash flow from continuing operating activities in was billion compared to billion in and billion in the decrease in cash flow from continuing operations for the year ended december   is primarily attributable to lower commodity prices  partially offset by higher sales volumes and realized gains on interest rate derivatives 
in december and january  
table of contents anadarko entered into interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional principal amount of billion 
in may and june  the company revised the contractual terms of this swap portfolio to increase the weighted average interest rate it is required to pay and realized million in cash 
the increase in cash flow from continuing operations for the year ended december   was attributable to higher commodity prices and lower income tax payments in compared to  when income tax payments were substantially higher as a result of divestiture activity 
this increase in cash flow was partially offset by the cash impact of lower sales volumes which decreased as a result of divestiture activity  and an increase in realized derivative losses in fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the company s short term changes in cash flow from operating activities  however  anadarko holds commodity derivative instruments that help to manage these cash flow fluctuations 
sales volume changes also impact short term cash flow  but have not been as volatile as commodity prices 
anadarko s long term cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon commodity prices  production sales volumes  reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations

additions to properties and equipment on the consolidated statement of cash flows include certain adjustments that give effect to the timing of actual cash payments in order to provide a cash basis presentation 
anadarko s capital expenditures decreased for the year ended december  primarily due to declines in development drilling expenditures onshore united states and expenditures on gathering and processing facilities 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in development drilling expenditures in ghana  exploration drilling expenditures onshore united states  property acquisition costs and capital expenditures related to the company s acquisition of its office buildings in the woodlands  texas 
the company s capital spending increased for the year ended december  the increase was due to an increase in development drilling expenditures primarily onshore in the us and exploration lease acquisition activity primarily offshore in the us  partially offset by a decrease in expenditures related to construction  and gathering and processing facilities 
additionally  both and were impacted by rising service and materials costs

margin deposits both exchange and over the counter traded derivative instruments may be subject to margin deposit requirements 
exchange broker margin requirements are determined by a standard industry algorithm  which requires a market risk based margin level be maintained on positions outstanding  from the date of trade execution through settlement 
for derivatives with over the counter counterparties  the company is required to provide margin deposits whenever its unrealized losses on derivative positions exceed predetermined credit limits 
the company manages its exposure to over the counter margin requirements through negotiated credit arrangements with counterparties  which may include collateral caps 
when credit thresholds are exceeded  the company utilizes available cash or letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and maintains ample available committed credit facilities to meet its obligations 
the company s working capital position and its rca are sufficient to satisfy margin deposit requirements resulting from a significant increase in commodity prices or from entering into additional derivative positions

maintaining financial discipline enables the company to capitalize on the flexibility of its global portfolio  while allowing the company to pursue new strategic and tactical growth opportunities 
the company s capital budgeting process is ongoing 
the company plans to allocate approximately of its capital spending to development activities  to exploration activities and to gas gathering and processing activities and other items 
the company expects capital spending by area to be approximately for the us onshore region  which includes the lower region and alaska  for the gulf of mexico  for international and for midstream and other 
the company s primary emphasis will be on managing near term growth opportunities with a commitment to worldwide exploration and the continued development of large oil projects in algeria  offshore ghana and in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
anadarko believes that its expected level of operating cash flows and cash on hand as of december   will be sufficient to fund the company s projected operational and capital programs for however  if capital expenditures exceed operating cash flow and cash on hand  funds would likely be supplemented as needed through short term borrowings under anadarko s fully available billion rca or through the issuance of debt or equity 
in addition  to support cash flows  anadarko has entered into strategic derivative positions as of december   on approximately of its anticipated natural gas sales volumes and approximately of its anticipated oil and condensate sales volumes for in addition  the company has entered into commodity price risk management derivative positions for the years and see note derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k

critical accounting estimates in preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap  management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including those related to the determination of properties and equipment  
table of contents proved reserves  goodwill  asset retirement obligations  litigation  environmental liabilities  pension liabilities and costs  income taxes and fair values 
changes in facts and circumstances or the discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates 
management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and discusses the selection and development of these estimates with the company s audit committee 
oil and gas activities anadarko applies the successful efforts method of accounting to account for its oil and gas activities 
under this method  acquisition costs and the costs associated with drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending the determination of proved oil and gas reserves 
geological and geophysical costs and other costs of carrying properties such as delay rentals are expensed as incurred 
acquisition costs acquisition costs of unproved properties are assessed for impairment during the holding period and transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities 
significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment  based on the company s current exploration plans  and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated 
for unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs  costs are amortized on a group basis over the average lease terms at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration 
costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged against the valuation allowance  while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties 
amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases are included in exploration expense 
significant undeveloped leasehold costs are assessed for impairment at a lease level or resource play for example  the greater natural buttes area in the rockies  while leasehold acquisition costs associated with prospective areas that have had limited or no previous exploratory drilling are generally assessed for impairment by major prospect area 
a majority of the company s unproved leasehold costs are associated with properties acquired in the kerr mcgee and western acquisitions in and to which proved developed producing reserves are also attributed 
generally  economic recovery of unproved reserves in such areas is not yet supported by actual production or conclusive formation tests  but may be confirmed by the company s continuing exploration and development programs 
another portion of the company s unproved leasehold costs are associated with the land grant acreage  where the company owns mineral interests in perpetuity and plans to continue to explore and evaluate the acreage 
a change in the company s expected future plans for exploration and development could cause an impairment of the company s unproved property 
exploratory costs under the successful efforts method of accounting  exploratory costs associated with a discovery well are initially capitalized  or suspended  pending determination of whether proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling 
at the end of each quarter  management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities in particular  whether the company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or  in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning  whether development negotiations are underway or proceeding as planned 
if management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur  associated suspended exploratory drilling costs are expensed 
therefore  at any point in time  the company may have capitalized costs on its consolidated balance sheet associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in a future period 
at december   suspended exploratory drilling costs were million compared to million at december  
table of contents proved reserves in december  anadarko adopted revised oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements which conforms the definition of proved reserves with the sec modernization of oil and gas reporting rules  which were issued by the sec at the end of the new accounting standard requires that the average  first day of the month price during the month period preceding the end of the year  rather than the year end price  be used when estimating reserve quantities and permits the use of reliable technologies to determine proved reserves  if those technologies have been demonstrated to result in reliable conclusions about reserves volumes 
prior year data are presented in accordance with fasb oil and gas disclosure requirements effective during those periods  however  historical information has been reclassified to conform to the significant geographic areas required to be disclosed in under the revised accounting standard 
anadarko estimates its proved oil and gas reserves as defined by the sec and the fasb 
this definition includes crude oil  natural gas  and ngls which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions  operating methods  government regulations  etc  ie  at prices as described above and costs as of the date the estimates are made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  and do not include adjustments based upon expected future conditions 
the company s estimate of proved reserves is made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
revisions are necessary due to changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions  as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling 
decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits earlier 
a material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on dd a expense and could result in the recognition of an impairment 
fair value the company estimates fair value for derivatives  long lived assets for impairment testing  reporting units for goodwill impairment testing  certain exchanges  guarantees  pension plan assets  the initial measurement of an asset retirement obligation  and assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination 
when the company is required to measure fair value  and there is not a market observable price for the asset or liability  or a market observable price for a similar asset or liability  the company generally utilizes an income valuation approach 
this approach is based upon management s best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows  and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk adjusted discount rate 
such evaluations involve significant judgment and the results are based on expected future events or conditions  such as sales prices  estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput  development and operating costs and the timing thereof  economic and regulatory climates and other factors 
the company s estimates of future net cash flows are inherently imprecise because they reflect management s expectation of future conditions that are often outside of management s control 
however  assumptions used reflect a market participant s view of long term prices  costs and other factors  and are consistent with assumptions used in the company s business plans and investment decisions 
business combinations accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
purchase price allocation the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value 
estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company s assets and liabilities and tax related carryforwards at the merger date  although such estimates may 
table of contents change in the future as additional information becomes known 
the amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost 
goodwill at december   the company had billion of goodwill recorded related to past business combinations 
goodwill is required to be assessed for impairment annually  or more often as facts and circumstances warrant 
the first step in assessing whether an impairment of goodwill is necessary is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets and goodwill 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment 
anadarko has allocated goodwill to three reporting units 
these reporting units are oil and gas exploration and production  gathering and processing  and transportation 
as of december   these reporting units have a goodwill balance of billion  million and million  respectively 
during  the company changed its goodwill impairment testing date from january to october the company completed its january   and october   annual goodwill impairment tests with no goodwill impairment indicated 
although anadarko cannot predict when or if goodwill will be impaired in the future  impairment charges may occur if the company is unable to replace the value of its depleting asset base or if other adverse events for example  lower sustained oil and gas prices reduce the fair value of the associated reporting unit 
because quoted market prices for the company s reporting units are not available  management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test 
management uses all available information to make these fair value estimates  including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets and observed for the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit  and market multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the gathering and processing and transportation reporting units 
in estimating the fair value of its oil and gas reporting unit  the company assumes production profiles utilized in its estimation of reserves that are disclosed in the company s supplemental oil and gas disclosures  market prices based on the forward price curve for oil and gas as of the test date adjusted for location and quality differentials  capital and operating costs consistent with pricing and expected inflation rates  and discount rates that management believes a market participant would utilize based upon the risks inherent in anadarko s operations 
for the company s gathering and processing and transportation reporting units  the company estimates fair value by applying an estimated multiple to projected ebitda 
the company considered the relatively few observable transactions in the market  as well as trading multiples for peers to determine an appropriate multiple to apply against the company s projected ebitda for its gathering and processing and transportation reporting units 
a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in a goodwill impairment 
factors that could trigger a lower fair value estimate include sustained price declines  cost increases  regulatory or political environment changes  and other changes in market conditions such as decreased prices in market based transactions for similar assets 
based on our most recent goodwill impairment test  we concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit 
therefore  no goodwill impairment was indicated 
impairment of assets a long lived asset other than unproved oil and gas property is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be greater than its future net undiscounted cash flows 
impairment  if any  is measured as the excess of an asset s carrying amount over its estimated fair value 
the company utilizes an income approach when market information for the same or similar assets does not exist 
this fair value approach requires us to use management s best estimates  including asset production profiles and cost expectations  combined with inputs a market participant would use eg  prices and discount rates 

table of contents derivative instruments all derivative instruments  other than those that satisfy specific exceptions  are recorded at fair value 
if market quotes are not available to estimate fair value  management s best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or utilizing industry standard valuation techniques 
the company s derivative instruments are either exchange traded or transacted in an over the counter market 
valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data for similar instruments 
option fair values are measured using the black scholes option pricing model and verified by comparing a sample to market quotes for similar options 
unrealized gains or losses on derivatives are recorded within anadarko s current earnings 
benefit plan obligations the company has non contributory defined benefit pension plans  including both qualified and supplemental plans  and a foreign contributory defined benefit pension plan 
the company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees 
determination of the projected benefit obligations for the company s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet  the amount of benefit expense recorded to the income statement  and the company s decision regarding amounts to be contributed to the plans 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions  the most significant of which relate to the discount rate used for measuring the present value of future plan obligations  the fair value and expected long term rates of return on plan assets  rate of future increases in compensation levels and health care cost projections 
anadarko analyzes demographics and utilizes third party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations 
discount rate the discount rate assumption used by the company reflects the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date 
the company currently uses a yield curve analysis to support the discount rate assumption for the plans 
this analysis involves the creation of a hypothetical aa spot yield curve represented by a series of high quality  non callable  marketable bonds  then discounts the projected cash flows from each plan at interest rates on the created curve specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow 
the present values of the cash flows are then accumulated  and a weighted average discount rate is calculated by imputing the single discount rate that equates to the total present value of the cash flows 
the consolidated discount rate assumption is determined by evaluation of the weighted average discount rates determined for each of the company s significant pension and postretirement plans 
the weighted average discount rate assumption used by the company as of december   was and for pension plans and other postretirement plans  respectively 
expected long term rate of return the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption was determined using the year end pension investment balances by category and projected long term target asset allocations 
the expected return for each of these categories was determined by using capital market projections 
the company s capital market projection uses a forward looking building block approach and is not strictly based upon historical returns 
equity returns are generally developed as the sum of inflation  expected real earnings growth and expected long term dividend yield 
bond returns are generally developed as the sum of inflation  real bond yield and risk spread as appropriate  adjusted for the expected effect on returns from changing yields 
other asset class returns are derived from their relationship to the equity and bond markets 
consideration was also given to current market conditions 
anadarko s expected long term rate of return is expected to be fairly consistent from year to year  however  it may change due to changes in asset allocation targets  changes in financial market conditions and changes in the general economic outlook 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption used by the company as of december   was 

table of contents rate of compensation increases the company s assumption is based on its long term plans for compensation increases specific to covered employee groups and expected economic conditions 
the assumed rate of salary increases includes the effects of merit increases  promotions and general inflation 
the weighted average rate of increase in long term compensation levels assumption used by the company as of december   was 
health care cost trend rate the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for  decreasing gradually to in and later years 
environmental obligations and other contingencies management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation  litigation and other contingent matters 
provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters  including  but not limited to  the stage of investigation  the stage of the remedial design  evaluation of existing remediation technologies  and presently enacted laws and regulations 
in future periods  a number of factors could significantly change the company s estimate of environmental remediation costs  such as changes in laws and regulations  changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations  revisions to the remedial design  unanticipated construction problems  identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater  and changes in costs of labor  equipment and technology 
consequently  it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the company s estimates 
the company s in house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess these contingent liabilities and  in certain circumstances  third party legal counsel or consultants are utilized 
income taxes the amount of income taxes recorded by the company requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of various tax jurisdictions throughout the world 
the company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences  operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
the company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and reduces such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and  if required  establishes accruals for such amounts 
the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are subject to a significant amount of judgment by company management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances 
although management considers its tax accruals adequate  material changes in these accruals may occur in the future  based on the progress of ongoing tax audits  changes in legislation and resolution of pending tax matters
