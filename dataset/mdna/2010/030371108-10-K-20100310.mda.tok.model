in august  amvac received a registration from the us environmental protection agency for impact active ingredient topramezone  a new herbicide for the use in field corn  seed corn  sweet corn and popcorn 
seasonality the agricultural chemical industry in general is cyclical in nature 
the demand for amvac s products tends to be slightly seasonal 
seasonal usage  however  does not necessarily follow calendar dates  but more closely follows varying growing seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
backlog amvac does not believe that backlog is a significant factor in its business 
amvac primarily sells its products on the basis of purchase orders  although it has entered into requirements contracts with certain customers 
customers tenkoz  crop production services  inc formerly united agri products  western farm services and crop production services  and winfield solution llc formerly agriliance accounted for  and  respectively of the company s sales in   and in  and  and in competition amvac faces competition from many domestic and foreign manufacturers in its marketplaces 
competition in amvac s marketplace is based primarily on efficacy  price  safety and ease of application 
many of such competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than amvac 
amvac s ability to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications for its current products and expand its product lines and customer base 
amvac competes principally on the basis of the quality of its products  its price and the technical service and support given to its customers 
generally  the treatment against pests of any kind is broad in scope  there being more than one way or one product for treatment  eradication  or suppression 
in most cases  amvac has attempted to position itself in smaller niche markets which are no longer of strong focus to larger companies 
intellectual property amvac s proprietary product formulations are protected  to the extent possible  as trade secrets and  to a lesser extent  by patents 
further  amvac s trademarks bring value to its products in both domestic and foreign markets 
although amvac considers that  in the aggregate  its trademarks  licenses  and patents constitute a valuable asset  it does not regard its business as being materially dependent upon any single trademark  license  or patent 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries epa registrations amvac s products also receive protection afforded by the effect of the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act fifra legislation that makes it unlawful to sell any pesticide in the united states unless such pesticide has first been registered by the environmental protection agency epa as well as under similar state laws 
substantially all of amvac s products are subject to epa registration and re registration requirements and are conditionally registered in accordance with fifra 
this registration by epa is based  among other things  on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when it is used according to approved label directions 
all states where any of amvac s products are used require a registration by that specific state before it can be marketed or used in that state 
state registrations are renewed annually  as appropriate 
the epa and state agencies have required  and may require in the future  that certain scientific data requirements be performed on registered products sold by amvac 
amvac  on its own behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants  has furnished  and is currently furnishing  certain required data relative to specific products 
under fifra  the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support us registrations 
this requirement results in operating expenses in such areas as testing and the production of new products 
amvac expensed   and  during  and  respectively  related to gathering this information 
because scientific analyses are constantly improving  it cannot be determined with certainty whether or not new or additional tests may be required by the regulatory authorities 
additionally  while fifra good laboratory practice standards specify the minimum practices and procedures which must be followed in order to ensure the quality and integrity of data related to these tests submitted to the epa  there can be no assurance the epa will not request certain tests studies be repeated 
amvac expenses these costs on an as incurred basis 
see also part ii  item of this annual report for discussions pertaining to research and development expenses 
raw materials amvac utilizes numerous firms as well as internal sources to supply the various raw materials and components used by amvac in manufacturing its products 
many of these materials are readily available from domestic sources 
in those instances where there is a single source of supply or where the source is not domestic  amvac seeks to secure its supply by either long term arrangements or advance purchases from its suppliers 
amvac believes that it is considered to be a valued customer to such sole source suppliers 
environmental during  amvac continued activities to address environmental issues associated with its facility the facility in commerce  ca 
an outline of the history of those activities follows 
in  the california department of toxic substances control dtsc conducted a resource conservation and recovery act rcra facility assessment rfa of those facilities having hazardous waste storage permits 
during that same year  ten underground storage tanks located at the facility were closed 
in march  the rfa culminated in dtsc accepting the facility into its expedited remedial action program 
under this program  the facility was required to prepare and implement an environmental investigation plan 
depending on the findings of the investigation  the facility might also be required to develop and implement remedial measures to address any historical environmental impairment 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries this activity then took two paths the rcra permit closure and the larger site characterization 
with respect to the permit closure  in  amvac began the formal process to close its hazardous waste permit at the facility which had allowed amvac to store hazardous waste longer than days as required by federal regulations 
formal regulatory closure actions began in and were completed in  as evidenced by dtsc s october  acknowledgement of amvac s closure certification report 
with respect to the site characterization  soil and groundwater characterization activities began in december in accordance with the site investigation plan that was approved by the dtsc 
additional activities were conducted from to with oversight provided by the dtsc 
risk assessment activities have commenced and are likely to continue over the next year under the oversight of the dtsc 
following such risk assessment activities  further investigation and or potential remediation activities may be initiated in or at this stage  the extent of further investigation and potential remediation activities is uncertain 
further  it is uncertain whether the cost associated with such investigation and potential remediation activities will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
because the risk assessment has yet to be completed  the company is unable to determine whether remediation is reasonably probable  nor can the cost of remediation be reasonably estimable the scope can vary depending upon the risk assessment and many other factors 
accordingly  the company has not set up a loss contingency with respect thereto 
amvac is subject to numerous federal and state laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee health and safety at the commerce  ca  marsing  id  hannibal  mo and axis  al facilities 
amvac continually adapts its manufacturing process to the environmental control standards of the various regulatory agencies 
the us epa and other federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that could have an impact on amvac s operations 
amvac expends substantial funds to minimize the discharge of materials in the environment and to comply with the governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment 
wherever feasible  amvac recovers raw materials and increases product yield in order to partially offset increasing pollution abatement costs 
the company is committed to a long term environmental protection program that reduces emissions of hazardous materials into the environment  as well as to the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns 
as part of its continuing environmental program  except as disclosed in part i  item  legal proceedings  of this annual report  the company has been able to comply with such proceedings and orders without any materially adverse effect on its business 
employees as of december   the company employed approximately employees 
amvac  on an ongoing basis  due to the seasonality of its business  uses temporary contract personnel to perform certain duties primarily related to packaging of its products 
the company believes it is cost beneficial to employ temporary contract personnel 
none of the company s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
the company believes it maintains positive relations with its employees

item a 
risk factors the company s business may be adversely affected by cyclical and seasonal effects 
the chemical industry in general is cyclical and demands for its products tend to be seasonal 
seasonal usage follows varying agricultural seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
weather patterns can have an impact on the company s operations 
the end user of some of its products may  because of weather patterns  delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting season  which may result in a reduction of the use of some products and therefore may reduce our revenues and profitability 
there can be no assurance that the company will adequately address any adverse seasonal effects 
the company faces competition in certain markets from manufacturers of genetically modified seeds 
the company faces competition from larger chemical companies that market genetically modified gmo seeds in certain of the crop protection sectors in which the company competes  particularly that of corn 
many growers that have chosen to use gmo seeds have reduced their use of pesticides sold by the company 
further  the federally mandated refuge acre requirement for corn which  in the name of preventing pest resistance  required growers using gmo seeds to set aside a percentage of their planting acres for non gmo seed  has been sharply reduced 
there is no guarantee that the company will maintain its market share or pricing levels in sectors that are subject to competition from gmo seed marketers or that federal mandates to set aside acreage for non gmo seed will continue 
the company s key customers typically carry competing product lines and may be influenced by the company s larger competitors 
a significant portion of the company s products are sold to national distributors who also carry product lines of competitors that are much larger than the company 
typically  revenues from the sales of these competing product lines and related program incentives constitute a greater part of our distributors income than 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries do revenues from sales and program incentives arising from the company s product lines 
further  these distributors are often under pressure to market competing product lines in favor of the company s 
in light of these facts  there is no assurance that such customers will market or continue to market our products aggressively or successfully or that the company will be able to influence such customers to purchase our products in favor of those of our competitors 
to the extent that capacity utilization is not fully realized at its manufacturing facilities  the company may experience lower profitability 
the company has pursued a business strategy of acquiring manufacturing facilities at a steep discount to their replacement value 
these acquisitions have enabled the company to be more independent of overseas manufacturers than some of our competitors 
while the company endeavors continuously to maximize utilization of these several facilities  our success in these endeavors is dependent upon many factors beyond our control  including fluctuating market conditions  product life cycles  weather conditions  availability of raw materials and regulatory constraints  among other things 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maximize its utilization of capacity at its manufacturing facilities 
to the extent that the company experiences excess manufacturing capacity  it may experience lower profitability 
reduced availability and higher prices of raw materials may reduce the company s profitability and could threaten the viability of some of its products 
in the recent past  there has been a material reduction in the number of suppliers of certain important raw materials used by the company in many of its products 
certain of these raw materials are available solely from sources overseas or from single sources domestically 
in the recent past  the price of these raw materials has fluctuated sharply 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to source some or all of these materials indefinitely or that it will be able to do so at a level of cost that will enable it to maintain its profit margin on its products 
foreign currency and interest rate risk and the use of derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company engages in global business transactions 
where possible  the company does business in its functional currency 
however  there are certain situations in which the company is unable to transact in its functional currency and engages in agreements that require settlement in a different currency 
the company has in place two fixed interest rate swaps with the objective of reducing the company s exposure to movements in the libor rate over time 
the hedges are evaluated at the end of each quarter and the effective portions of gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income  while the ineffective portions are recorded in current earnings 
quarterly variability in factors affecting the company s business may mean that an individual quarter s result may not provide a realistic picture of the company s overall performance 
due to elements inherent to the company s business  such as differing and unpredictable weather patterns  crop growing cycles  changes in sales mix  ordering patterns that may vary in timing  and promotional programs  measuring the company s performance on a quarterly basis  gross profit margins on a quarterly basis may vary significantly even when such comparisons are favorable  is not as meaningful an indicator as full year comparisons 
the primary reason is that the use cycles do not necessarily coincide with financial reporting cycles 
the company s cost structure  the combination of variable revenue streams  and the changing product mixes  result in varying quarterly levels of profitability 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries the potential impact on the company s operations during an economic downturn 
this country and many others are in the midst of an economic downturn that was touched off by a meltdown of financial markets in late early this condition has penetrated the markets in which the company does business and has reduced demand for these products  as many customers have changed their procurement practice to a just in time approach and have endeavored to reduce their own inventory levels 
this has resulted in a decrease in sales volume and negatively impacted our results of operations 
there is no guarantee that economic conditions will stabilize or will not worsen 
further  volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit our customers ability to obtain adequate financing or credit to purchase and pay for our products in a timely manner or to maintain operations  and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
such volatility and disruption could adversely affect the company s ability to obtain financing for both working capital needs and acquisitions 
dependence on the company s banking relationship 
the company s main bank is bank of the west  a wholly owned subsidiary of the french bank  bnp paribas 
bank of the west has been the company s primary bank for more than years 
bank of the west is the syndication manager for the company s loans and acts as the counterparty on the company s derivative transactions 
the company reviews the creditworthiness of its banks on a quarterly basis via both credit agencies and face to face meetings with senior management of the banks 
management believes that the company has an excellent working relationship with bank of the west and the other financial institutions in the company s banking syndicate 
nevertheless  in light of both the current strain on the financial markets and the company s recent financial performance  there is no guarantee that the company s lenders will be either willing or able to continue lending to the company at such rates and in such amounts as may be necessary to meet the company s working capital needs 
use of the company s products is subject to continuing challenges from activist groups 
use of the company s products is regularly challenged by activist groups in many jurisdictions under a multitude of federal and state statutes  including fifra  the food quality protection act  endangered species act  and the clean water act  to name but a few 
these challenges typically take the form of lawsuits or administrative proceedings against the epa and or other federal or state agencies  the filing of amicus briefs in pending actions  the introduction of legislation that is inimical to the company s interests  and or adverse comments made in response to public comment invited by epa in the course of registration  reregistration or label expansion 
the company spends considerable resources anticipating and defending these challenges 
while we have had some success in maintaining the continued uses of many of our products in the face of this onslaught  it is possible that one or more of these challenges could succeed  resulting in a material adverse effect upon one or more of our products 
the regulatory climate has grown increasingly hostile to the company s interests both domestically and internationally 
with the election of the current administration  various agencies within the federal government have begun to exercise increased scrutiny in permitting continued uses or the expansion of such uses of older chemistries  including many of the company s products and  in some cases  have initiated or entertained challenges to these uses 
at the regulatory level  the principles of sound science to which the company has always subscribed have been adulterated  in some cases  by political considerations 
the hostility of the regulatory climate is even more pronounced in certain other geographical regions  most especially the european union and brazil  where the company faces continued resistance toward the continued use of certain of its products 
there is no guarantee that this climate will change in the near term 
nor is there any guarantee that the company will be able to maintain or expand the uses of many of its products in the face of these regulatory challenges 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries the company may be unable to maintain compliance with covenants in its senior secured lending facility 
under the terms of its senior lending facility  the company is required to comply with a number of covenants  some of which relate to financial performance 
in light of the company s recent financial performance  continued working capital requirements  and challenging market conditions  there is a risk that the company may be unable to continue to comply with one or more of those covenants 
such noncompliance could require the company to re negotiate new terms with its lenders which  in all likelihood  would lead to the incurrence of transaction costs and higher interest rates  further  there is no guarantee that  in the event of such noncompliance  all of the company s lenders would be willing to participate in a new senior secured credit facility or that they would be willing to do so on terms that are favorable to the company 
the distribution and sale of the company s products are subject to prior governmental approvals and thereafter ongoing governmental regulation 
the company s products are subject to laws administered by federal  state and foreign governments  including regulations requiring registration  approval and labeling of its products 
the labeling requirements restrict the use of and type of application for our products 
more stringent restrictions could make our products less desirable  which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
substantially all of the company s products are subject to the epa registration and re registration requirements  and are conditionally registered in accordance with fifra 
such registration requirements are based  among other things  on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when used according to approved label directions 
all states where any of the company s products are used also require registration before they can be marketed or used in that state 
governmental regulatory authorities have required  and may require in the future  that certain scientific data requirements be performed on the company s products 
the company  on its behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants  have and are currently furnishing certain required data relative to its products 
there can be no assurance  however  the epa will not request certain tests or studies be repeated or that more stringent legislation or requirements will not be imposed in the future 
the company can provide no assurance that any testing approvals or registrations will be granted on a timely basis  if at all  or that its resources will be adequate to meet the costs of regulatory compliance 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to acquire new product lines 
the company has grown primarily by a strategy of acquiring mature product lines from larger competitors and expanding sales of these products based on new applications and new users 
however  over the course of the last few years  the market for product acquisition has grown increasingly competitive  and the cost of these acquisitions as a multiple of sales has risen sharply 
further  its current level of indebtedness would constrain the company from using borrowed debt to make a material acquisition 
there is no guarantee that opportunities to acquire product lines will continue to become available to the company in the near term  nor is there any guarantee that the company will be able to finance any such acquisition from traditional sources 
the manufacturing of the company s products is subject to governmental regulations 
the company currently operates three manufacturing facilities in los angeles  california  axis  alabama  and marsing  idaho and owns and has manufacturing services provided in a fourth facility in hannibal  missouri the facilities 
the facilities operate under the terms and conditions imposed by required licenses and permits by state and local authorities 
the manufacturing of key ingredients for certain of the company s products occurs at the facilities 
an inability to renew or maintain a license or permit or a significant increase in the fees for such licenses or permits could impede the company s access to key ingredients and increase the cost of production  which  in turn  would materially and adversely affect the company s ability to provide its products in a timely and affordable manner 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries the company may be subject to environmental liabilities 
the company  its facilities  and its products are subject to numerous federal and state laws and governmental regulations concerning hazardous materials  environmental matters and employee health and safety 
the company continually adapts its manufacturing process to the environmental control standards of the various regulatory agencies 
the us epa and other federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that could have a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company expends substantial funds to minimize the discharge of materials into the environment and to comply with governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment and its workforce 
federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations  and could  among other things  impose liability on the company for cleaning up the damage resulting from release of pesticides and other agents into the environment 
further  while the company continually adapts its manufacturing process to the environmental control standards of regulatory authorities  it cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous or regulated materials 
in the event of such contamination or injury  the company may be held liable for significant damages or fines 
in the event that such damages or fines are assessed  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial and operating results 
the company s business may give rise to product liability claims not covered by insurance or indemnity agreements 
the manufacturing  marketing  distribution and use of chemical products involve substantial risk of product liability claims 
a successful product liability claim that is not insured may require the company to pay substantial amounts of damages 
in the event that such damages are paid  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial and operating results 
adverse results in pending legal and regulatory proceedings could have adverse effects on the company s business 
the company is currently  and may from time to time  be involved in legal and regulatory proceedings 
the results of litigation and such proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
the company has and will continue to expend resources and incur expenses in connection with these proceedings 
for further discussion on legal risks  please see item legal proceedings below 
the company relies on intellectual property that it may be unable to protect  or may be found to infringe the rights of others 
the company s proprietary product formulations are protected  to the extent possible  as trade secrets and  to a lesser extent  by patents and trademarks 
most of the mature products that the company has acquired that were patented are currently off patent because the patents have expired 
the company can provide no assurance that the way it protects its proprietary rights will be adequate or that its competitors will not independently develop similar or competing products 
further  the company can provide no assurance that it is not infringing other parties rights 
any claims could require the company to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  develop non infringing intellectual property  or acquire licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of asserted infringement 
the company relies on key executives in large part for its success 
the company s success is highly dependent upon the efforts and abilities of its executive officers 
the loss of the services of one or more key executive officers could have a material adverse effect upon the company s 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries financial and operating results 
further  in light of its recent financial performance  reduced stock price  and reduced compensation for executives  there is no guarantee that the company will be able to retain or to continue to attract qualified executives 
the company is dependent on a limited number of customers  which makes us vulnerable to the continued relationship with and financial health of those customers 
in  three customers accounted for of the company s sales 
the company s future prospects will depend on the continued business of such customers and on our continued status as a qualified supplier to such customers 
the company cannot guarantee that our current significant customers will continue to buy products from us at current levels 
the loss of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s stock price may continue to be depressed  and this might make the company an acquisition target 
over the past year  the market prices for securities of the company as well as those many companies in the company s industry have been depressed this pricing may be due in part to poor market conditions and comparatively weak financial performance 
if the current trend in stock price should continue or worsen  the company may become increasingly attractive as a target for acquisition  whether friendly or hostile 
in the event of such acquisition  there is no guarantee that current stockholders will receive consideration in excess of what they might have paid for company shares 
the company s business may be adversely affected by terrorist activities 
the company s business depends on the free flow of products and services through the channels of commerce 
recently  in response to terrorists activities and threats aimed at the united states  transportation  mail  financial and other services have been slowed or stopped altogether 
further delays or stoppages in transportation  mail  financial or other services could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  the company may experience an increase in operating costs  such as costs for transportation  insurance and security as a result of the activities and potential activities 
the company may also experience delays in receiving payments from counterparties that may have been affected by the terrorist activities and potential activities 
the us economy in general is being adversely affected by the terrorist activities and potential activities and any economic downturn could adversely impact results of operations  impair the ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely affect the ability to grow the business

item legal proceedings a 
dbcp cases introductory notes 
a number of suits have been filed against amvac  alleging injury from exposure to the agricultural chemical  dibromo chloropropane dbcp 
dbcp was manufactured by several chemical companies  including dow chemical company  shell oil company and amvac and was approved by the us epa to control nematodes 
dbcp was also applied on banana farms in latin america 
the us epa suspended registrations of dbcp in october  except for use on pineapples in hawaii 
the epa suspension was 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries partially based on studies by other manufacturers that indicated a link between male sterility and exposure to dbcp among their factory production workers producing the product 
nicaraguan cases 
thus far there are approximately lawsuits  foreign and domestic  filed by former banana workers in which amvac has been named as a party 
fifteen of these suits have been filed in the united states with prayers for unspecified damages and the remainder have been filed in nicaragua 
three of these domestic suits were brought by citizens of nicaragua while the other domestic suits have been brought by citizens of other countries 
these claims are all in various stages and allege injury from exposure to dbcp  including claims for sterility 
all but two of the suits filed in nicaragua are unserved 
all but one of the suits in nicaragua have been filed pursuant to special law  an october nicaraguan statute that contains substantive and procedural provisions that nicaragua s attorney general previously expressed as unconstitutional 
each of the nicaraguan plaintiffs claims million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages 
in all of these cases  amvac is a joint defendant with dow chemical and dole food company  inc in the two cases pending before nicaraguan courts in which amvac has been served  the court has denied amvac s objection to jurisdiction  which is being appealed 
on october   in a case captioned osorio v 
dole food company  the us district court for the southern district of florida entered an order in which it refused to recognize a million judgment that had been rendered by a trial court in chinandega  nicaragua in favor of plaintiffs against dow and dole under special law for alleged exposure to dbcp 
in reaching its decision in osorio  the court found that it was improper to recognize the nicaraguan court s judgment under the florida recognition act because special law is fatally unfair and discriminatory and fails to provide defendants with a minimum level of due process  the irrefutable presumption of causation under special law violates public policy  and the nicaraguan judgment was rendered under a system which does not provide impartial tribunals 
in light of both the decision in osorio and the los angeles superior court s finding of pervasive fraud in mejia and rivera as described below  amvac believes that its exposure to liability in nicaragua cases is significantly diminished 
accordingly  the company believes that a loss in these matters is neither probable nor reasonably estimable and has not incurred a loss contingency therefor 
recently dismissed state court cases over the course of  a number of active state court cases involving dbcp claims were dismissed 
they are described below 
mejia 
on september   rodolfo mejia et al 
v 
dole food company  inc et al  was filed in the los angeles county superior court on behalf of nicaraguan plaintiffs  with several other plaintiffs subsequently added  who claimed sterility or reduced sperm counts and were allegedly dbcp applicators 
punitive damages were sought against each defendant 
the court advised that discovery would be limited to plaintiffs and any others beyond that number must be transferred to another case 
discovery on the claims of the plaintiffs began  and plaintiffs counsel dismissed the claims of several plaintiffs leaving only plaintiffs from the original group  one of whom the company had settled with in an earlier action entitled tellez 
in late  defendant dole reported that its investigation of this matter revealed potential fraud among plaintiffs and certain of plaintiffs counsel regarding the claims alleged in the action 
in response  the court entered a protective order and permitted discovery to proceed relating to these fraud allegations 
while the court had originally set a preliminary trial for september  to determine whether the plaintiffs have committed fraud in filing their claims  in the face of evidence showing fraud  on march   the court issued an order to show cause osc why the matter should not be dismissed with prejudice 
a three day evidentiary hearing on the osc commenced april   at the conclusion of which the court found that there had been massive amounts of evidence demonstrating the recruiting and training of fraudulent plaintiffs to bring cases in both the nicaraguan 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries and us courts and that what has occurred here is not just a fraud on this court  but is a blatant extortion of the defendants 
the court found further that the conduct of plaintiffs and 
certain of 
plaintiffs attorneys 
was 
so outrageous and pervasive and profound that it far exceed 
ed 
anything described in any of the reported cases and that the standard for awarding termination sanctions had been indisputably met under a clear and convincing standard 
accordingly  as of april   the court dismissed both mejia and rivera described below with prejudice 
rivera 
on october   an action entitled rivera et al 
v 
dole food company  inc was filed on behalf of four nicaraguan plaintiffs in the los angeles county superior court against dole food company  inc  dole fresh fruit company  standard fruit company  standard fruit and steamship company  the dow chemical company  and amvac chemical corporation 
the complaint alleges that the four plaintiffs worked at various banana farms in nicaragua and were exposed to dbcp from to  suffering irreversible sterility or infertility 
the complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages against each defendant 
the suit was assigned to the same judge for case management and trial as in the mejia matter 
after the complaint was amended and several plaintiffs were added to mejia  one plaintiff remained in rivera and the action was stayed pending resolution of mejia 
as described above  following the osc hearing that concluded april   the court dismissed both rivera and mejia with prejudice 
patrickson 
in october  amvac was served with a complaint s in which it was named as a defendant 
the matter was filed in the circuit court  first circuit  state of hawaii and in the circuit court of the second circuit  state of hawaii two identical suits entitled patrickson  et 
al 
v 
dole food co  et 
al  and alleges damages sustained from sterility and other injuries caused by exposure of plaintiffs banana workers to dbcp while applying the product in their native countries from through at least the ten named plaintiffs are citizens of four countries guatemala  costa rica  panama  and ecuador 
punitive damages are sought against each defendant 
the matter was eventually transferred to state court in oahu 
on june   that court granted defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action with prejudice as to six of the plaintiffs  finding that these plaintiffs were barred from making their claims under the applicable statute of limitations 
the remaining four plaintiffs were subsequently dismissed without prejudice 
ivory coast cases 
on october   amvac was served with seven suits filed in the los angeles county superior court and one suit in the united states district court in los angeles that include a total of residents of the ivory coast as plaintiffs 
each plaintiff claims bodily injuries from exposure to dbcp while residing or working on banana or pineapple plantations in that country from the s to the present 
the suits name amvac  dow chemical  shell oil company  and dole food as defendants 
all these suits also seek punitive damages  and the action filed in federal court alleged a claim under the alien tort claims act  alleging that the sale and use of dbcp amounted to genocide in the ivory coast 
defendants successfully obtained the dismissal of these federal claims 
in the seven state court actions  plaintiffs counsel petitioned the court to withdraw from representing plaintiffs 
on september   the court granted the motion of plaintiffs counsel and ordered that unless the plaintiffs either appear in person before the court or appoint new counsel by october   the court intended to dismiss the actions without prejudice 
in light of the fact that plaintiffs failed either to appoint new counsel or to appear personally  the court dismissed these actions without prejudice on october  pending state court cases 
louisiana cases 
in november  amvac chemical corporation was served with three complaints filed in the th judicial district court for the parish of st 
charles  state of louisiana entitled pedro rodrigues et 
al v 
amvac chemical corporation et 
al  andres puerto  et

al 
other named defendants are dow chemical 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries company  occidental chemical corporation  shell oil company  standard fruit  dole food  chiquita brands  tela railroad company  compania palma tica  and del monte fresh produce 
these suits were filed in  but they were not served until november following a dismissal of most of the plaintiffs from the action in light of the fact that they had previously settled their claims in other actions  the complaints  with soriano as the lead case  allege personal injuries to about persons from ecuador  from costa rica  and from guatemala from alleged exposure to dbcp punitive damages are also sought 
with the united states supreme court holding there was no federal court jurisdiction in the patrickson case  the federal court judge remanded the cases to louisiana state court in june in state court  the three cases were assigned to two different judges 
on november   the state court separated the cases handled by attorney scott hendler from the cases being pursed only against the growers handled by different counsel 
subsequently  the cases against the growers were settled and all those actions were dismissed 
the cases handled by mr 
hendler were supposed to be placed in a new action  which was not done 
after a hearing on january   the court ruled on february  that these plaintiffs could still proceed in the existing cases rather than in a new pleading 
no discovery has taken place 
at this stage  the company believes that a loss in these matters is neither probable nor reasonably estimable and  accordingly  has not accrued a loss contingency therefor

each case alleged damages sustained from injuries caused by plaintiffs who are former banana workers and citizens of a central american country exposure to dbcp while applying the product in their native countries 
these cases were removed to us district court for the southern district of mississippi  southern division 
the federal court granted defense motions to dismiss in each case pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens 
on january   the court issued an unpublished decision  finding that there was jurisdiction in federal court  but remanded just one case espinola back to the trial court based on a stipulation which limited the plaintiff s recovery to fifty thousand dollars 
no activity has taken place on this matter since without discovery  it is unknown whether this plaintiff was exposed to the company s product or what defenses may apply 
amvac intends to contest the cases vigorously 
at this stage  the company believes that a loss in these matters is neither probable nor reasonably estimable and  accordingly  has not accrued a loss contingency therefor

results of operations in thousands compared with change net sales crop non crop gross profit crop non crop our overall financial performance including net sales and net income for the year is down compared to the year 
our net sales for decreased to  as compared to  for the same period in year over year  net sales for the crop business are down  while net sales of our non crop segment are down 
there are four major factors that contributed to the company s financial performance in first  in the wake of the global credit crisis that has persisted for the past several quarters  many of our customers implemented policies of inventory reduction and procurement on a just in time basis 
as a result  customers deferred  and or placed limits upon  purchase orders for the company s goods 
interestingly  we are finding that  based upon electronic data interchange edi data which measures actual on the ground use of our products  although generally speaking sales to our customers who are primarily distributors are below levels  growers appear to be applying volumes similar to those applied in second  weather conditions  particularly rain in the midwest at corn planting season  a lack of precipitation in the south and southwest in the spring  a late soybean harvest and an early frost in potato planting regions in the fourth quarter  reduced demand for some of our key  higher margin products 
third  for much of  the company has been engaged in an 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries initiative to improve its balance sheet by  among other things  reducing inventory and scaling down its manufacturing activity in the face of short term demand reduction 
in the course of this initiative  the company has sold lower margin goods and incurred unabsorbed manufacturing costs 
fourth  as more fully explained below  the company took a onetime non cash charge in the amount of  in the fourth quarter of relating to inventory cost reductions arising primarily from our assessment of net realizable value 
these factors as they relate to specific product lines are further discussed in the following section 
in spite of adverse weather conditions in the midwest namely  persistent precipitation that delayed planting sales of our granular soil insecticides were down slightly approximately year over year 
led by our aztec product line  we experienced comparatively stronger sales of granular soil insecticides in the first half of versus however  this sales trend was offset by a decline late in the second half of  due in part to reduced use of our counter product line in sugar beets and to high levels of inventory in the channels 
net sales of our leading product line  soil fumigants  were down about in as compared to this decline was due largely to a shortened application season caused by two factors first  a delayed harvest in the midwest prevented growers from applying the product as early as they historically do  and second  an earlier than usual onset of freezing and snow conditions in potato planting regions in the fourth quarter effectively cut the application season short 
net sales of our herbicides for were about lower than those of  due primarily to the sales performance of our post emergent corn herbicide  impact 
while the year started at or above targeted sales levels  in the second quarter  sales of impact declined significantly in part due to rainy conditions in the midwest delaying the corn planting season thereby affecting the use of post emergent herbicides generally and in part to customers electing to reduce their inventory 
during the fourth quarter of  sales of impact were also down compared to the same period of  as customers increasingly elected to defer product purchases until closer to the time of application in late winter or spring 
net sales of our insecticide product lines for were about lower than after a good start in  sales of our insecticides dropped in the second quarter of due to reduced acres in cotton on which bidrin is used and peanuts on which thimet is used and a decrease in pest pressure on cotton and other crops 
in the third quarter  sales of broad spectrum insecticide  orthene  increased 
however  that trend trailed off in the fourth quarter  as our product line faced generic pricing pressure and high inventory levels in the channel of trade 
in addition  a lack of precipitation and pest pressure in our primary markets resulted in a drop in sales of our mosquito adulticide  dibrom  during both third and fourth quarters of the decline in sales of this higher margin product negatively impacted both top and bottom line performance 
as noted in the vs 
comparison below  dibrom had record sales in in the face of a heavy hurricane season 
also declining in net sales year over year were our fungicides  which experienced a drop of in that period 
this decline resulted primarily from reduced international demand for our pcnb product line  as an international customer had ordered a multi year supply in and declined to order product in our plant growth regulators pgrs generated consistently strong sales performance all year  led by our naa product line  net sales of pgrs for were up approximately over those of also we saw solid performances from our two main foreign subsidiaries ie mexico and costa rica 
however  international sales as a whole performed below the levels achieved in the same period of this includes some impact from tight regional credit control  some large transactions in that have not repeated in the current year  and regulatory pressure in brazil and the european union 
our cost of sales for was  or of net sales 
this compared to  or of net sales for the same period in there are two primary reasons for this result 
first  in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a onetime non cash charge in the amount of  relating to adjusting inventory values to net realizable value  these adjustments include identifying obsolete and slow moving items in the amounts of and  respectively  adjusting standards in the amount of  to reflect under utilized capacity due 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries to significantly below normal output levels in two of our manufacturing sites  and  in annual adjustments to ensure all standard costs closely reflect actual costs 
the charge impacts our crop segment cost of sales by  and our non crop segment cost of sales by  in arriving at its inventory valuation  the company took into account  among other things  recent and current market conditions including pricing  demand  distribution and competitive products as well as cost of goods including the burden of unabsorbed manufacturing costs 
a material portion of the charge related to the product  fortress  and the balance related to counter  thimet and pcnb specifically relating to unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs as well as certain slow moving and obsolete skus 
beyond the non cash charge  the cost of goods was also adversely affected by trading performance over the course of  which  in turn  was driven by several factors 
first  gross profit as a percentage of sales was reduced by tolling activities which benefited plant utilization but served to lower gross profit levels 
second  we experienced some price erosion on international sales made in order to maintain our market share in the face of heavy competitive pressure 
third  as part of our initiative to reduce inventory  we reduced factory throughput  thereby reducing the absorption of fixed costs 
furthermore  in the first quarter we experienced significant environmental cost overruns on the start up of a new product in production 
gross profit ended at  or of net sales in as compared to  and of net sales for this decline is predominantly due to the non cash charge taken in the fourth quarter and the increased cost of goods as described in the immediately preceding paragraph 
it should be noted that  when making comparisons with other companies financial statements  the company reports freight  delivery and warehousing costs in operating expenses and not as a part of cost of sales 
operating expenses in increased by  to  or of sales as compared to  or in the differences in operating expenses by department are as follows change selling general and administrative research  product development and regulatory freight  delivery and warehousing selling expenses increased by  to  as compared to  for the same period of the increase predominately relates to program expenses  which were up  due to delayed sales of granular soil insecticides from q of to q of in addition  we have had a full year of operations for our costa rica subsidiary which increased overall costs by we increased field staff in order to focus on product stewardship  sales and marketing at a cost of offsetting these costs  we reduced some advertising  promotional and other paid marketing costs by general and administrative expenses increased by  to end at  for year ended december  this includes spending of  reported in the first quarter of  relating to a major potential acquisition 
legal expenses were up as compared to the prior year arising primarily from costs incurred in arbitrations to collect data compensation 
furthermore  we have made some selective key recruitments during the year which have overall increased costs by we have spent on tax consulting that has driven benefits in our tax rate during the year 
finally  we had some currency gains in which did not recurred in generating an increase in expense of these costs were offset by reduced bonus accruals of  reflecting the financial performance and other cost savings including officer and director pay reductions 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries research  product development costs and regulatory registration expenses increased by  to  for  as compared to  for the same period of the main drivers were increased product defense costs up relating to both recently acquired product lines and established product lines 
also  research and development spending was up  as we have increased our resources aimed at developing new products and different formulations to improve our range of product offerings 
freight  delivery and warehousing costs for decreased by  to  or of sales as compared to  or of sales for the same period of this reduction as a percentage of sales reflects continued effort to control these expenses by careful distribution in the supply chain and savings related to urgent shipments coupled with lower sales levels 
specifically  in the three months ended september   lower sales of our mosquito products drove significantly lower freight costs 
interest expense including capitalized interest and interest income were  in compared to  in interest costs are summarized in the following table average indebtedness and interest expense average debt interest expense interest rate average debt interest expense interest rate term loan real estate working capital revolver average other notes payable other adjustments capitalized interest interest income adjusted average the company s average overall indebtedness for dropped by  to end at  as compared to  for we reduced the revolver debt mainly as a result of focusing on inventory reduction during the last six months of the year 
furthermore  we have maintained a strong control on receivables  including being willing to sacrifice some international sales when credit checks did not meet our criteria  and controlled our capital spending levels 
we have also made the decision to pay customer programs in the first weeks of our results have been favorably impacted by movement in the libor rate during libor is the base for our syndicated borrowings and  as can be seen from the table above  our effective interest rate was in as compared to in as also shown in the table  the company had reduced interest adjustments in as a result of lower capital spending as compared to which included capitalized interest of and interest income of income tax benefit for ended at  as compared to an income tax expense of  for our effective tax rate is at  as compared to an effective rate of for net income decreased by  to end at a loss of  or a loss of

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we believe that our cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least the next months 
although operating activities are expected to provide cash  to the extent of significant growth in the future  our operating and investing activities may use cash and  consequently  this growth may require us to obtain additional sources of financing

foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its customers in the last three fiscal years has adversely affected the company s ability to sell products at agreed upon prices denominated in us dollars 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future 
should adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations occur in geographies where the company sells exports its products  management is not certain such fluctuations will or will not materially impact the company s operating results 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations during the past three years 
however  management has witnessed a trend of rising costs with respect to raw materials sourced in other countries 
whether this trend arises from inflation or other factors is uncertain 
critical accounting policies certain of the company s policies require the application of judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are based on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  commonly accepted industry practices and other assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

essentially they are volume or other key performance indicator kpi driven payments made to distributors or retailers at the end of a growing season 
each quarter management applies experience and market place knowledge to estimate the current liability 
long lived asset the carrying value of long lived assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
management considers the carrying value of long lived assets to be reasonable 
generally  the fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
property  plant and equipment and depreciation property  plant and equipment includes the cost of land  buildings  machinery and equipment  office furniture and fixtures  automobiles  construction projects and significant improvements to existing plant and equipment

these re evaluations are performed at the end of each quarter 
the company did not enter into any foreign currency hedge contracts during as of december  and  the company also has in place two interest rate swap contracts that are accounted for under fasb asc the company qualifies for the short cut method for these swaps and performs quarterly re evaluations to determine continued qualification for this method 
any gains or losses on derivative instruments that are deemed effective are taken as an adjustment to other comprehensive income loss

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the provisions of fasb asc  identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those with indefinite lives are not amortized 
the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset to the company is based upon a number of factors including the effects of demand  competition  and expected changes in the marketability of the company s products 
the company re evaluates whether these intangible assets are impaired on an annual basis  relying on a number of factors including operating results  business plans and future cash flows 
identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate elements of property 
the impairment test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization consisting of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss  if any  is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires the company to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset s being tested for impairment as well as selecting a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows 
when determining future cash flow estimates  the company considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by the company  in such areas as future economic conditions  industry specific conditions  product pricing and necessary capital expenditures 
the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for long lived assets  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
the company has performed an impairment review for the year ending december and there were no impairment losses recorded 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  primarily from its borrowing activities

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries the company conducts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe and mexico 
therefore changes in the value of the currencies of such countries or regions affect the company s financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
the company has mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of its currency exchange exposure through natural hedges based on the operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which the majority of all costs are local currency based 
a change in the value of all foreign currencies would have an immaterial effect on the company s financial position and cash flows 
as part of an on going process of assessing business risk  management has identified risk factors which are disclosed in item a
