critical accounting policies general our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
for example  we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ substantially from the historical factors that we use 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 

table of contents allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i fasb acs  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when their occurrence is probable and estimable and ii fasb acs  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of the collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
we evaluate non performing loans individually for impairment  such as nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of the impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment 
in an effort to better develop the estimate used for allowance for loan loss  we have implemented a pc based software system to document and perform consistent calculations and document the logic and reasons for the estimate on a monthly basis 
while it gives a more controlled environment  some decisions or estimates as to the collectability of a loan are left with the chief credit officer and the loan committee 
specific information  including the comments of the loan officer and the credit officer  is maintained within this software by utilizing a separate tab for each loan that has a specific reserve assigned 
each tab has the same format and performs the calculations based on the prescribed procedure 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  we make estimates of losses for groups of loans 
loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon historical loss rates for each loan type  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimates of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans including borrower or industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending staff  and national and local economic conditions 
the allowance for loan loss software maintains a tab which calculates the reserve assigned to each group based on the variables listed above 
the amounts of estimated losses for loans individually evaluated for impairment and groups of loans are added together for a total estimate of loan losses 
the estimate of losses is compared to our allowance for loan losses as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses is greater than the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be considered 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether a reduction to the allowance would be necessary 
while management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations 
such adjustments would be made in the relevant period and may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
in  additional provisions were made to bring the total allowance in line with the projected estimate 
other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis our investment committee reviews any securities which are considered to be impaired as defined by accounting guidance 
during this review  the committee determines if the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary 
if it is determined that the impairment is other than temporary  ie impaired because of credit issues rather than interest rate  the investment is written down through the statement of operations in accordance with accounting guidance 
goodwill goodwill is evaluated annually to see if there is any impairment associated with its value

table of contents executive overview during  the financial instability of continued to impact the banking industry 
in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis  the fnma and fhmc issues of impairment and conservatorship and the rapid rate cutting by the federal reserve in  our industry also was faced with revisions to tarp by a new administration  an unprecedented increase in bank failures and the resulting valuation decline in pooled trust preferred securities that derived value from the cash flow they receive from the participating banks 
the bank failures also precipitated a cash flow problem for the fdic  which prompted a special assessment on insured banks and the prepayment of future assessments 
in addition  the federal government continues to debate the overhaul of the bank regulatory structure and hierarchy creating uncertainty in the banking industry concerning the ultimate impact of these changes 
within this environment  the recession continued most of the year with higher unemployment  lower new home starts  growing bankruptcy filings and higher loan delinquencies 
while the economy appears to have started a slow but staggered resurgence  we expect that will be the year banks capital will be tested by the number of loans that go bad and how many more banks fail 
we believe eastern virginia bankshares  inc is strong and viable 
we have a strong capital base 
we have experienced lenders and collectors  who are doing all they can to minimize the financial damage to customers and the bank 
we initiated a special loan program to assist customers who are having difficulty with their mortgage debt and have booked over million in these loans through december  and have growing demand for the product 
we continue to have demand for loans 
we have survived economic downturns for the past one hundred years and expect to continue that tradition 
despite the depressed economy  our balance sheet  the primary driver of income  grew in total assets increased million from billion at the end of to billion at the end of gross loans  our primary earning asset  are up million and deposits are up million  compared to year end 
federal funds sold at year end were zero but we spent much of the year in a sold position with an average balance for the year of million 
most of this surplus of funds was caused by the million in tarp money that we received in january of federal funds purchased at year end were million as we used the low cost of these funds to fund a short term securities transaction at year end 
fhlb borrowings decreased million as we paid off a maturing loan and paid down others 
as a result of this growth  we believe that we are well positioned to start with the potential to produce a good earnings flow 
however  as we learned in  the economic downturn that we are experiencing can produce surprises which can impact our earnings potential 
in  we felt the full impact of bank failures when we took an other than temporary impairment charge on most of our preferred trust investments 
this resulted in an million write down that resulted in a loss of million in net income and million in income available to common shareholders 
we were profitable in the first and fourth quarters but our earnings were negatively impacted by increased fdic expense  higher provision for loan loss  the impact of nonaccrual interest lost  the added impact of a cumulative dividend on the new preferred stock and costs related to the terminated merger with first capital bank 
the investment write down allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet by removing the unrealized loss for the downgraded investments 
the result was higher risk weighted capital ratios and a stronger company moving forward 
we believe that evb s earnings potential is in the balance sheet but in we will have to work through loan challenges and project continued high provision expense 
if the economy improves in  we expect to benefit with increased earnings 
net income loss for the year ended december was a net loss of million  an million decrease from net income of million in net income loss available to common shareholders was a loss of million  or per share 
net interest income in increased by thousand from million in to million in income from earning assets not fte decreased million  while the cost of funding declined million 
the yield on earning assets was down basis points as a result of the lower interest rate environment created by the federal reserve in and pricing pressure 
while loans were pricing at lower rates and interest and fees from loans declined million from  our securities portfolio was influenced by the lower rates of new investments and the loss or lowering of some income sources as they decreased million from the levels 
the securities income decline was the result of the loss of fnma and fhlmc income and 
table of contents preferred trust income while fhlb suspended its dividend early in then paid a lower dividend later in the year 
the cost of funds decrease was the result of year long re pricing moves in all our deposit categories with most of the results showing in the second half of the year  especially the fourth quarter 
we are encouraged by this interest expense swing since it resulted in increased quarterly net interest margins in the fourth quarter for the first time in almost two years 
noninterest income was a charge of million for  a decrease of million compared to million in the driver of the loss was the million impairment loss taken on the trust preferred investment instruments which was the result of defaulted and deferred interest payments from the debt issuers 
other noninterest income categories were impacted by the economy as deposit service charges were down to million from million in card fees were up to million compared to million in this had been a double digit growth product over the last few years 
noninterest expense increased million  primarily from a million increase in fdic expense and thousand in merger related expenses 
salary and benefits increased as a result of higher pension plan and group insurance expense 
occupancy costs were up in operating categories such as utilities  building supplies and rental  while equipment expense was up thousand primarily from a thousand increase in the it service contract and software maintenance expenses 
this last expense was the result of software upgrades across our pc network 
increases in the other expenses category  other than the fdic and merger expenses  were controlled with limited increases and a decline in marketing and advertisement costs 
management is encouraged by what we believe are the initial signs of an economic turn around and  while it may be slow in emerging  we are confident that when the economy does expand that we are in a position to benefit from it 
in  we committed to maintain the stability of our company 
while the economy impacted us in unanticipated ways in  we feel we are in a good position to take on our primary challenge is in asset quality  which we address on an almost daily basis 
until the economy improves  growth will be limited  and our plan for is to concentrate on our existing markets and build our relationships with existing customers 
however  while we do not plan any new branch openings in  we are open to opportunities that may present themselves 
if these opportunities arise  we will evaluate them and will act to enhance shareholder value

table of contents net interest income the primary source of income for our company is net interest income which represents our gross profit margin and is defined as the difference between interest income and interest expense 
for comparative purposes  income from tax exempt securities is adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of and adjusted by the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act tefra adjustment 
this latter adjustment is for the disallowance as a deduction of a portion of total interest expense related to the ratio of average tax exempt securities to average total assets 
by making these adjustments  tax exempt income and their yields are presented on a comparable basis with income and yields from fully taxable earning assets 
net interest margin is a ratio based on the formula of net interest income divided by average earning assets which represents the profits left over after paying for deposits and borrowed funds 
changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income

average loans excluding nonaccrual loans grew million in to million compared to million in in spite of the growth in our loans  these earning assets were re pricing or being added to the portfolio at lower yields while the largest portion of our interest bearing liabilities  certificates of deposits  re priced slowly over the last two years 
however  the interest rate spread declined basis points in compared to a decline of basis points in the prior year comparison 
this demonstrates the narrowing of the re pricing gap that has existed over the last two years 
all categories of earning assets grew in except for taxable securities 
average securities were up million with a decline of million in taxable securities and a million increase in tax exempt securities 
taxable securities income in decreased million as a result of the absence of fnma and fhlmc securities income  a sharp decline in trust preferred income and a lower fhlb dividend 
tax exempt income in increased thousand  after a thousand increase in the to period and reflects a conscious effort by management to restructure the portfolio 
as a result of the tarp money received early in the year  the average balance of federal funds was up million in at million compared to million in the infusion of these funds  while welcomed  presented a challenge since federal funds were earning below basis points  so management spent a large part of the year redeploying these funds to higher earning assets while experiencing the earnings drag during the first half of for  total average interest bearing deposits grew million  or  with increases in all categories except savings and consumer certificates of deposit as consumers continued to move to interest bearing checking and money market savings 
for  interest bearing checking experienced the largest growth in total dollars and increased million  despite interest rate changes which lowered the product s yield basis points to in compared to for this category is comprised mostly of our reward checking product with its above market interest rate and demonstrates customers interest in better returns on their deposit funds 
in  interest bearing checking was of the total average interest bearing deposits portfolio  compared to in the largest percentage increase in interest bearing deposits in was money market savings which grew million or when compared to totals  also despite a decline of basis points in its rate from in to in savings average balances were down slightly to million in from in consumer certificates  comprising of our average interest bearing deposit base in but in  decreased million 
the certificate balance changes were influenced by a decrease in brokered deposits and a movement out of the bank by cd depositors whose only relationship with the bank was a cd based solely on interest rate 
large dollar certificates of deposit increased million from million in to million in the interest cost of all interest bearing deposits decreased in all categories except money market where the volume increase accounted for the higher interest expense 
total cost of interest bearing deposits in was million compared to million in certificates of deposits accounted for million of the cost decrease as consumer certificates were down million 
the movement of funds from longer term instruments which are paying lower rates to liquid higher yielding instruments  points to our customers need for liquidity in the current economic environment and the desire to be flexible as rates eventually move up 
average borrowings are down in as we paid off a million fhlb borrowing early in the year and have not needed to borrow any funds during the year 
by the end of the year  management moved to a funds purchased position to take advantage of the lower rates for short term and over night funding while maximizing the spread from higher yielding earning assets 
average noninterest bearing demand deposits decreased million compared to continuing a trend seen over the last two years 
in  average earning assets grew or million  while interest bearing liabilities grew or million 
average loans grew million from a combination of loans purchased with the millennium branch deal and growth in our existing markets 
average deposits grew million  or  again influenced by the branch purchases 
the yield on average earning assets declined basis points  while the rate on interest bearing liabilities was down basis points for a decline in the net rate spread of basis points 
this large decline was the result of the rapid interest rate cuts implemented by the federal reserve over late and average securities were up million  while federal funds were down million

interest sensitivity our primary goals in interest rate risk management are to minimize negative fluctuations in net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets and to increase the dollar amount of net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets 
these goals are accomplished by managing the interest sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities in a specific time interval 
interest sensitivity gap is managed by balancing the volume of floating rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating rate assets  by keeping the fixed rate average maturity of asset and liability contracts reasonably consistent and short  and by routinely adjusting pricing to market conditions on a regular basis 
we generally strive to maintain a position flexible enough to move to equality between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  which may be desirable when there are wide and frequent fluctuations in interest rates 
matching the amount of assets and liabilities maturing in the same time interval helps to hedge interest rate risk and to minimize the impact on net interest income in periods of rising or falling interest rates 
interest rate gaps are managed through investments  loan pricing and deposit pricing 
when an unacceptable positive gap within a one year time frame occurs maturities can be extended by selling shorter term investments and purchasing longer maturities 
when an unacceptable negative gap occurs  variable rate loans can be increased and more investment in shorter term investments can be made 

table of contents in a year where the bond rate yield curve moved back to a more normal slope and the federal reserve did not change rates  our balance sheet moved back to an asset sensitive status 
in an environment where we anticipate rates will rise sometime in the near future  late or first quarter  we have moved to a position where we have more assets set to re price than liabilities and based on model forecasts  this appears to be the situation for at least the next year 
depositors remain uncertain about where to put their money  especially with the probability of a continuation of the current economic recession  and are keeping their funds in more liquid investments which will allow them to react to any rate increases 
our balances in interest checking and money market savings accounts have been our fastest growing deposit categories  as customers looking for safer investments have moved deposits to us 
with the decreases in the interest rates paid on deposits and the lag in them repricing  our current interest sensitivity position is where we want to be going into noninterest income noninterest income charge for was million  a decrease of million  compared to this decline was driven by million in impairment charges in the pooled trust preferred securities in our available for sale securities portfolio 
the losses were brought on by the closing or depressed income streams of many banks in and which resulted in defaults or deferred payments of the interest requirements on the pooled trust preferred instruments that backed these securities

while the dollar amount of the increase in real estate loans was the highest single category  the mix has changed with real estate construction loans down million as we decreased our exposure to acquisition and development business in consumer loan balances continue a declining trend with being an anomaly with a slight gain 
the increases in loan balances are the result of growth within our existing markets and we expect growth to be from a similar source 
the gloucester and richmond areas continue to offer opportunities for steady growth

in  loan growth was steady but provided decreased volume compared to at year end  loans  net of unearned income  were million  up million or from million at year end loan growth for all periods reported was primarily driven by increases in the real estate portfolio 
in the fourth quarter of  the company performed a loan scrub of all loan categories which resulted in some movement from category to category 
the changes put us in position to more effectively report our loan categories based on federal reserve definitions

with such a large portion of our portfolio secured by real estate and property valuations still dropping  management recognizes that presents some major challenges 

table of contents while consumer loans are the fifth largest component of our loan portfolio comprising of the portfolio at year end compared to at year end and at year end  it is also a steadily declining balance 
the portfolio s primary component consists of installment loans 
net consumer loans for household  family and other personal expenditures totaled million at year end  a decrease of million from million at year end and very close to the decline during the period the continued decline in this category is the result of intense competition for consumer borrowing dollars and changes in consumer lifestyle resulting in increasing emphasis on fast and easy one step loans 
while automobile loans were once a major part of our consumer loan portfolio  we have opted out of the automobile dealer loan market because the dealers can offer and lower interest loans and for the same reason  we receive fewer direct auto loan requests 
we even compete with ourselves in this category since our heloc and second mortgage products cover many of the loan purposes previously covered in consumer loans 
these circumstances continue and we expect will continue a trend that started in of decreasing consumer loans both in absolute amount and percentage of the total loan portfolio 
commercial and agricultural loans are designed specifically to meet the needs of small and medium size business customers 
this category of loans increased million  or to million at december  compared to million at december  in it amounted to of our portfolio compared to only of the total portfolio at year end compared to at year end management believes much of this growth is the result of businesses taking on debt as working capital to get over the slow times the recession has brought on 
consistent with our focus on providing community based financial services  we generally do not make loans outside of our principal market region 
we do not engage in foreign lending activities  consequently the loan portfolio is not exposed to the sometimes volatile risk from foreign credits 
we further maintain a policy not to originate or purchase loans classified by regulators as highly leveraged transactions or loans to foreign entities or individuals 
our unfunded loan commitments  excluding credit card lines and letters of credit  at year end total million compared to million at year end 
unfunded loan commitments excluding million in home equity lines are used in large part to meet seasonal funding needs which are generally higher from spring through fall than at year end 
historically  our loan collateral has been primarily real estate because of the nature of our market region 
however  as we expand into newer markets at the fringe of our existing market foot print  we are encountering other collateral options which in lieu of real estate  are booked based on strong credit guidelines and controls to monitor the status of the collateral 
asset quality our allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the amount needed to provide for inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
in determining adequacy of the allowance  we consider our historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  specific impaired loans  the overall level of nonaccrual loans  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  experience and depth of lending staff  effects of credit concentrations and economic conditions 
as mentioned previously  in an effort to better monitor and utilize this large number of variables  we installed a pc based program designed to track the allowance for loan loss  calculate the expected amount to cover a distressed loan and present a total of all loss requirement either based on loan groupings or specific allowance reserves within loan groups 
based on the sum from this model  the allowance is increased by expensing to the provision for loan losses an estimated amount that management deems needed to bring the total allowance for loan losses to the estimated level at the end of each monthly period 
the offset to the expense is the allowance account on the balance sheet to which charge offs  net of recoveries are posted 
because the risk of loan loss includes general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses can only be an estimate 
our ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate owned at year end increased to compared to at december  and up from at december  
table of contents the continued increase in this measure points out the severity of the national recession and its impact on the lending environment 
nonperforming assets increased million  or to million at year end  compared to million at year end net charge offs for increased thousand or to million  compared to million for the year we have a loan review committee consisting of bank officers and board members 
additionally  an independent credit review firm performs a review of loans  including a fasb acs review for determining specific reserves 
we utilize the pc program that is risk based to accumulate the required reserve based on the regulatory purpose code loan types  specific reserve within a loan type  collateral with updates on the valuation of the real estate  equipment or other assets and the payment history on the loan and the experience with the borrower now and in the past to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on this loan review process and analysis 
in the current lending environment with the economic markets stressed and our borrowers struggling  management expensed million to the provision for loan loss compared to million expensed in and expects to reserve a similar amount in as the risk assessments dictate 
in  at year end  evb had a ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding of compared to at year end and to at december   respectively 
for the same dates  the loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans ratio was  and  indicating that  while the allowance appears adequate  its ability to cover the nonaccrual loans has narrowed and management sees these loans as their primary area of focus in the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subject to regulatory examinations and review of such factors as the method used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to regulatory identified peer companies 
the regulators during their exams can also require us to write off a loan that they consider a loss based on their evaluation 
we will continue to adjust our loan loss reserve in as our portfolio risks dictate 
we will work with our customers  where feasible  through these tough economic times 
in addition  we will review all of the new initiatives that the us government implements that may offer relief to our borrowers

table of contents nonperforming assets total nonperforming assets  consisting of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  loans past due days or more  and other real estate owned  increased million or to million at year end  while total loans outstanding  net of unearned discount  increased million or to million for the same period 
the ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate at year end was compared to at year end these sharp increases in the ratios reflect the impact the recession is having on our customers and the increased risk in our loan portfolio 
nonperforming loans at year end were million which included million in nonaccrual loans with million of the nonaccrual loans secured by real estate in our market area  million of commercial and agricultural loans and thousand of consumer loans 
based on estimated fair values of the related collateral using independent  third party appraisers  we consider the nonperforming real estate loans recoverable  with any individual deficiency covered by the allowance for loan losses 
we have no agricultural loans on nonaccrual at december  and the commercial nonaccruals primarily consist of two customers with million and thousand  respectively 
some of these customer s loans are cross collateralized with real estate and we have million and thousand in specific reserve  respectively 
between these reserves and the various collateral items  management believes the debt will be covered 
excluding the two customers mentioned above  we have thousand in non real estate secured nonaccrual loans at december  all non real estate secured and unsecured loans are automatically placed on nonaccrual status when they reach the day past due mark 
some loans can be and are placed on nonaccrual status at the time when the collection of principal and interest are considered to be doubtful 
real estate loans days or more are reviewed and placed on non accrual at the discretion of the collection manager 
credit card loans and other personal loans are typically charged off before reaching days past due 
in all cases  loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered unlikely 
no interest is accrued on loans placed in a nonaccrual status  and any unpaid interest previously accrued on such loans is reversed when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status 
if interest on nonaccrual loans had been accrued  such income would have approximated thousand and thousand for the years and  respectively 
troubled debt restructure tdr loans are loans that we have worked out agreements with the borrower  usually to their advantage  in order to help the borrower work through a difficult time 
at december   we had million  or loans  in this category 
all these loans are secured by some type of real estate and are monitored on a monthly basis to see that they are following the agreement 
it is hoped that these loans will return to a normal status in the future 
at december   we had approximately thousand in loans in the process of foreclosure 
this number fluctuates as borrowers bring loans current  pay them out or have them sold at the foreclosure auction 
loans that the bank buys back at foreclosure go to the other real estate owned oreo category 
this is the last category in nonperforming assets and amounted to million at year end compared to thousand at year end the oreo balance consists of twenty properties with million in other construction loans  million in family residential real estate construction loans and thousand in family residential mortgages 
this is an increase from our historical levels and reflects a weak and slow real estate market  since balances are staying in this category for a longer period of time 
all of the balances at the end of were disposed of in and none of the balances have been on the books for more than months

this is a continuation of what began in and is a direct result of the current recession 
we expect that this increased level of charge offs will probably continue through or until the economy really turns around 
as stated earlier  reserves will continue to be increased as needed 
while loans are charged off  there is some potential to recover portions in the future 
at december   we reported million in impaired loans  an increase of million from million at december  of this million in impaired loans  million were included in nonperforming loans 
the average balance of impaired loans for the twelve months ended december  was million 
loans are viewed as impaired based upon individual evaluations of discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
these loans are subject to constant management attention  and their status is reviewed on a regular basis 
securities securities available for sale include those securities that may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in the security s prepayment risk  increases in loan demand  general liquidity needs  and other similar factors  and are carried at estimated fair market value 
an independent third party review of this portfolio is made annually and presented to the board of directors as an unbiased presentation of our risks and the condition of the portfolio 
at december  the securities portfolio excluding restricted securities carried at cost  at fair market value  was million  an increase from million at year end 
the effect of valuing the available for sale portfolio at market  net of income taxes  is reflected as a line in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet as accumulated other comprehensive income of thousand at december  compared to a loss of million at year end 

table of contents we follow a policy of not engaging in activities considered to be derivative in nature such as options  futures  swaps or forward commitments 
we consider derivatives to be speculative in nature and contrary to our historical philosophy 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes

we recognized other than temporary impairment on pooled trust preferred debt securities classified as afs in accordance with asc as required by this asc guidance  we assessed whether we intend to sell or it was more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period losses 
we separated the amount of impairment into the loss that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors 
the credit loss component was recognized in earnings 
the remaining difference between the securities fair value and present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors not credit related  and therefore  was not required to be recognized as a loss in the income statement  but was recognized in other comprehensive income 
we believe that we will fully collect the carrying value of securities on which we have recorded a non credit related impairment in other comprehensive income 
after much deliberation and consultation with an independent securities appraisal firm that specializes in valuing illiquid securities  we recognized an impairment through the statement of operations in of million  reducing our book value of pooled trust preferred securities to thousand  thousand of which is in a senior performing tranche that has an unrealized gain at year end 
the independent appraiser followed other than temporary impairment otti guidelines in determining that the total lack of an orderly market for nonperforming pooled trust preferred securities was the result of credit issues in this class of securities 
the model used to develop the fair market value considered performing collateral ratios  the level of subordination to senior tranches of the securities  credit ratings of and projected credit defaults in the underlying collateral and the discounted present value of projected future cash flows 
after this impairment  our remaining pooled trust preferred securities no longer have an unrealized loss 

table of contents of the million of credit related otti included in the statement of operations for the year ended december   million of the loss occurred prior to year end  and was included net of tax as an unrealized loss of million in other comprehensive income loss at december  the million that was considered a temporary loss at december  because of the lack of an orderly market became a credit related loss in as defaults and nonperforming collateral in the trust preferred securities increased substantially 
impairment of pooled trust preferred securities occurred first in the second quarter of  then again in the third quarter of using the required discounted present value of expected future cash flows  none of these securities were considered to have otti until the second quarter of  then they deteriorated more in the third quarter of at the end of the third quarter of the independent evaluation determined that preferred term security xxiv  xxv and xxvi and sloso cdo b l were worthless

interest rates paid on deposits are carefully managed to provide an attractive market rate while at the same time not adversely affecting the net interest margin 
borrowings through the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb are utilized for funding when the cost of borrowed funds falls below the cost of new interest bearing deposits 
we also utilize purchased deposits from a couple of sources when the rates are below our market rates 
at year end  our total deposit balance was 
table of contents million  an increase of million  or  from million at year end all of this growth was from our existing markets and achieved in a depressed economy 
our loan growth in continued but at a slower pace and with the tarp funds added in january of in addition to the deposit growth  we had excess funds for most of the year 
management continued to hold brokered deposits but at a lower level than in at year end  there were million in brokered deposits compared to million at december  brokered deposits include deposits under the cdars program 
in  brokered deposits had extremely low rates available and we purchased deposits with staggered maturities over the next four years to decrease our sensitivity to interest rate risk 
noninterest bearing deposits decreased by thousand or to million at year end compared to million at december  a more representative review of the year long funding picture is the average deposits for the year  which reflect how much we are really funding over the year 
for  average total deposits of million represented a increase over the average of million 
noninterest bearing average deposits declined million to million for savings declined thousand compared to a decline of million  or in in looking at these two categories  it is important to note that customers want a return on their money  so the trend in our lowest cost deposit categories is down which forces the bank to pay more for deposits 
money market accounts  our fastest growth category  increased to million while the rate decreased basis points 
in  large dollar certificates of deposit increased million  or  while consumer certificates declined million  or 
interest bearing checking accounts now had our largest dollar increase with growth of million  or compared to an increase of million  or  in this increase is attributed to our reward checking product  whose balances have continually grown since its introduction in late this product pays an above market interest rate if customers achieve some basic requirements that encourage the customer to utilize electronic transactions which are less costly to the bank 
it continues to grow even with a lowering of the base rate and restrictions on the balance that can earn the high interest rate 
it is a convenient way for our customers to get a good return on their deposits  which appears to be a big part of its appeal 
interest rates on all interest bearing liabilities were lower in  as management was able to lower rates and reprice incoming or roll over deposits at rates that matched the lower rate environment that the federal reserve brought us to in the rates on large certificates of deposit fell basis points  while money market accounts were lower by basis points 
now accounts declined basis points and regular certificates declined basis points 
the maturity of large blocks of certificates of deposits in the last half of the year allowed us to reprice at a lower rate and allow rate shoppers to consider other sources 
these decreases in interest expense  while earning assets yields were declining  allowed our margin to grow in the third and fourth quarters 
the interest checking account products  at million or of total average deposits  have clearly moved this product to our largest single category moving large certificates of deposits to a second position in the deposit balance ranking 
the liquidity of the funds in interest checking funds presents a challenge to management in attempting to determine which of these relationships is a core deposit versus just a parking of funds until rates increase 
attracting deposits has been a challenge  and as the competition for funds heats up over the next couple of years  this is considered a critical area for managing our margin and profit 
the high interest rate environment in the market three years ago  then the rapid decline in rates in  coupled with the plummeting economy have made customers and potential customers fearful of what will happen to their money 
management s challenge in continues to be managing the net interest margin in a recessionary economy by anticipating  reacting to and adjusting to each new change in the markets 
total deposits at year end of million increased million  or  compared to million at year end 
our branch purchases from millennium in added million to the balance 
the other major source was an increase in brokered deposits with million in balances 
average deposit growth in was in all categories except demand and savings 
average deposits for were million  an increase of  or million  compared to average deposits of million

capital represents original investment by shareholders plus retained earnings and provides financial resources over which we can exercise greater control as compared to deposits and borrowed funds 
regulatory authorities have adopted guidelines to establish minimum capital standards 
specifically  the guidelines classify assets and balance sheet items into four risk weighted categories 
the minimum regulatory total capital to risk weighted assets is  of which at least must be tier capital  defined as common equity and retained earnings  plus trust preferred debt up to of tier capital  less goodwill and intangibles 
at december   we had a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier leverage ratio of  both in excess of regulatory guidelines and the amount needed to support our banking business 
capital is carefully managed as the financial opportunities of a high capital base are weighed against the impact of the return on equity ratio 
in january  we announced a stock repurchase program intended to reduce high capital levels and to increase return on equity to shareholders 
this plan was amended in and the number of shares that can be repurchased is of the outstanding shares on january of each year 
we repurchased no shares in   shares in and  shares in details of the number of shares available and purchases by month can be seen in our q filings with the sec 

table of contents as discussed in note of the attached financials  on january  we issued preferred stock to the u 
s 
treasury which added million to capital 
the preferred stock will pay cumulative dividends at a fixed rate of per annum for the first five years  and thereafter  at a rate of per annum 
the addition of these funds helped us maintain strong capital positions in the following table provides an analysis of our capital as of december   and note in the consolidated financial statements presents an analysis of the capital position of both our company and evb as of year end  and analysis of capital at december  dollars in thousands tier capital preferred stock common stock surplus retained earnings total equity trust preferred debt less goodwill and intangibles total tier capital tier capital allowance for loan losses deductions for other investments total risk based capital risk weighted assets capital ratios tier risk based capital total risk based capital tier capital to average total assets federal reserve requires a deduction from capital for the value of other llc s that the company has an interest in 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had million of off balance sheet credit exposure in the form of million of commitments to grant loans and unfunded commitments under lines of credit and million of standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
the commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the amount of collateral obtained  if it is deemed necessary by us  is based on our credit evaluation of the customer 
unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit  revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
these lines of credit are usually uncollateralized and do not always contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we are committed 

table of contents standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending a loan to our customers 
we generally hold collateral supporting those commitments if deemed necessary 
liquidity liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash  deposits with other banks  federal funds sold  investments and loans maturing or repricing within one year 
our management of liquid assets provides a liquidity level that we believe is sufficient to satisfy our depositors requirements and to meet our customers credit needs 
at december   million or of total earning assets were due to mature or reprice within the next year 
we also maintain additional sources of liquidity through a variety of borrowing arrangements 
federal funds borrowing arrangements with major regional banks combined with immediately available lines of credit with the federal home loan bank totaled million at december  at year end  we had million of fhlb borrowings outstanding 
during  we reduced our fhlb borrowings by million 
the following table presents our contractual obligations and scheduled payment amounts due at various intervals over the next five years and beyond 
as of payments due by period total less than year years years over years dollars in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total inflation in financial institutions  unlike most manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a bank s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rate movement is not necessarily tied to movements in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates 
accounting rule changes refer to note of the audited financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
our market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
we are responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of evb and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
the board of directors reviews guidelines established by management 
it is our policy not to engage in activities considered to be derivative in nature such as futures  option contracts  swaps  caps  floors  collars or forward commitments 
we consider derivatives as speculative which is contrary to our historical or prospective philosophy 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
we do hold in our loan and securities portfolios investments that adjust or float according to changes in index rates which is not considered speculative  but necessary for good asset liability management 

table of contents asset liability risk management the primary goals of asset liability risk management are to maximize net interest income and the net value of our future cash flows within the interest rate limits set by our asset liability committee alco 
interest rate risk measurement interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complementary measures static gap analysis  earnings simulation modeling and net present value estimation 
while each of the interest rate risk measurements has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of our interest rate risk  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
static gap gap analysis measures the amount of repricing risk embedded in the balance sheet at a point in time 
it does so by comparing the differences in the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
a gap is defined as the difference between the principal amount of assets and liabilities  adjusted for off balance sheet instruments  which reprice within a specific time period 
the cumulative one year gap at year end was which is within the policy limit for the one year gap of plus to minus of total earning assets at a combined company level 
core deposits and loans with noncontractual maturities are included in the gap repricing distributions based upon historical patterns determined by statistical analysis  based upon industry accepted assumptions including the most recent core deposit defaults set forth by the ffiec federal financial institutions examination council 
the gap repricing distributions include principal cash flows from residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in the time frames in which they are expected to be received 
mortgage prepayments are estimated by applying industry median projections of prepayment speeds to portfolio segments based on coupon range and loan age 
earnings simulation the earnings simulation model forecasts one year net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effects on income of alternative interest rate scenarios against earnings in a stable interest rate environment 
this type of analysis is also most useful in determining the short run earnings exposures to changes in customer behavior involving loan payments and deposit additions and withdrawals 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects net income would decrease approximately of stable rate or base net income if rates were to fall immediately by basis points to a fed funds rate of 
it projects an increase of approximately if rates rise by basis points 
management believes this reflects an asset sensitive interest risk for the one year horizon 
historically this simulation has evaluated the impact of a rate decrease of basis points  and internally we also evaluate monthly the impact of rate changes of basis points and basis points 
however with current fed funds rate at basis points  we consider a rate decrease to a level below zero to be meaningless 
this dynamic simulation model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time  in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from historical analysis and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry median estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
noncontractual deposit growth rates and pricing are assumed to follow historical patterns 
the sensitivities of key assumptions are analyzed at least annually and reviewed by management 

table of contents net present value the net present value npv of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows 
interest rate risk analysis using npv involves changing the interest rates used in determining the cash flows and in discounting the cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in npv is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
at year end  a basis point immediate increase in rates is estimated to decrease npv by 
additionally  npv is estimated to increase by if rates fall immediately by basis points 
analysis of the average quarterly change in the treasury yield curve over the past ten years indicates that a parallel curve shift of basis points or more is an event that has less than a chance of occurrence 
as with gap analysis and earnings simulation modeling  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in npv analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving mortgage prepayments and the assumptions about expected attrition of the core deposit portfolios 
these assumptions are applied consistently across the different rate risk measures 
management has determined that simulation shock ratios for a decrease to a negative interest rate are meaningless 
thus data is presented under a scenario of rates decreasing basis points to zero 
year end data in a basis point downward shock is not available
