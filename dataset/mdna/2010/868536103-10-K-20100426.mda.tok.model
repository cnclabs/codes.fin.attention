critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting standards requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are discussed in note the company and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more subjective or complex judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents vendor funds the company receives funds from many of the vendors whose products the company buys for resale in its stores 
these vendor funds are provided to increase the sell through of the related products 
the company receives vendor funds for a variety of merchandising activities placement of the vendors products in the company s advertising  display of the vendors products in prominent locations in the company s stores  supporting the introduction of new products into the company s retail stores and distribution system  exclusivity rights in certain categories  and to compensate for temporary price reductions offered to customers on products held for sale at retail stores 
the company also receives vendor funds for buying activities such as volume commitment rebates  credits for purchasing products in advance of their need and cash discounts for the early payment of merchandise purchases 
the majority of the vendor fund contracts have terms of less than a year  with a small proportion of the contracts longer than one year 
the company recognizes vendor funds for merchandising activities as a reduction of cost of sales when the related products are sold 
vendor funds that have been earned as a result of completing the required performance under the terms of the underlying agreements but for which the product has not yet been sold are recognized as reductions of inventory 
the amount and timing of recognition of vendor funds as well as the amount of vendor funds remaining in ending inventory requires management judgment and estimates 
management determines these amounts based on estimates of current year purchase volume using forecast and historical data and review of average inventory turnover data 
these judgments and estimates impact the company s reported operating earnings and inventory amounts 
the historical estimates of the company have been reliable in the past  and the company believes the methodology will continue to be reliable in the future 
based on previous experience  the company does not expect there will be a significant change in the level of vendor support 
however  if such a change were to occur  cost of sales and advertising expense could change  depending on the specific vendors involved 
if vendor advertising allowances were substantially reduced or eliminated  the company would consider changing the volume  type and frequency of the advertising  which could increase or decrease its advertising expense 
similarly  the company is not able to assess the impact of vendor advertising allowances on creating additional revenues as such allowances do not directly generate revenue for the company s stores 
for fiscal  a percent change in total vendor funds earned  including advertising allowances  with no offsetting changes to the base price on the products purchased  would impact gross profit by less than basis points 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
substantially all of the company s inventory consists of finished goods 
approximately percent and percent of the company s inventories were valued using the last in  first out lifo method for fiscal and  respectively 
the company uses a combination of the retail inventory method rim and replacement cost method to determine the current cost of its inventory before any lifo reserve is applied 
under rim  the current cost of inventories and the gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the current retail value of inventories 
under the replacement cost method  the most current unit purchase cost is used to calculate the current cost of inventories 
the first in  first out method fifo is used to determine cost for some of the remaining highly perishable inventories 
if the fifo method had been used to determine cost of inventories for which the lifo method is used  the company s inventories would have been higher by approximately and as of february  and february   respectively 
during fiscal  and  inventory quantities in certain lifo layers were reduced 
these reductions resulted in a liquidation of lifo inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared with the cost of fiscal  and purchases 
as a result  cost of sales decreased by  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  the company evaluates inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in its facilities 
allowances for inventory shortages are recorded based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the financial statement date 
although the company has sufficient current and 
table of contents historical information available to record reasonable estimates for inventory shortages  it is possible that actual results could differ 
as of february   each basis point change in the estimated inventory shortages would impact the allowances for inventory shortages by approximately reserves for closed properties and property  plant and equipment related impairment charges the company maintains reserves for costs associated with closures of retail stores  distribution centers and other properties that are no longer being utilized in current operations 
the company provides for closed property operating lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date  reduced by estimated subtenant rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
the closed property lease liabilities usually are paid over the remaining lease terms  which generally range from one to years 
the company estimates subtenant rentals and future cash flows based on the company s experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located  the company s previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions 
adjustments to closed property reserves primarily relate to changes in subtenant income or actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known 
owned properties  capital lease properties and the related equipment and leasehold improvements at operating leased properties that are closed are reduced to their estimated fair value 
the company estimates fair value based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located and  when necessary  utilizes local real estate brokers 
the expectations on timing of disposition and the estimated sales price or subtenant rentals associated with closed properties  owned or leased  are impacted by variable factors including inflation  the general health of the economy  resultant demand for commercial property  the ability to secure subleases  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the company s success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
while management believes the current estimates of reserves for closed properties and related impairment charges are adequate  it is possible that market and economic conditions in the real estate market could cause changes in the company s assumptions and may require additional reserves and asset impairment charges to be recorded 
the company s reserve for closed properties was  net of estimated sublease recoveries of  as of february  and  net of estimated sublease recoveries of  as of february  the company recognized asset impairment charges of  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives the company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  and also if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the reviews consist of comparing estimated fair value to the carrying value at the reporting unit level 
the company s reporting units are the operating segments of the business 
fair values are determined by using both the market approach  applying a multiple of earnings based on guideline for publicly traded companies  and the income approach  discounting projected future cash flows based on management s expectations of the current and future operating environment 
the rates used to discount projected future cash flows reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on the company s industry  capital structure and risk premiums including those reflected in the current market capitalization 
if management identifies the potential for impairment of goodwill  the fair value of the implied goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill 
an impairment charge is recorded for any excess of the carrying value over the implied fair value 
fair value calculations contain significant judgments and estimates related to each reporting unit s projected future revenues  profitability and cash flows 
when preparing these estimates  management considers each reporting unit s historical results  current operating trends and specific plans in place 
these estimates are impacted by 
table of contents variable factors including inflation  the general health of the economy and market competition 
the company has sufficient current and historical information available to support its judgments and estimates 
however  if actual results are not consistent with the company s estimates  future operating results may be materially impacted 
for the fourth quarter ended february   the review of goodwill for impairment indicated that the fair value for one reporting unit with  of goodwill exceeded the carrying value by less than percent and the fair value for another reporting unit with of goodwill exceeded the carrying value by greater than percent 
the remaining of goodwill is at a reporting unit with fair value that substantially exceeds the carrying value 
if the company s stock price experiences a significant and sustained decline  the company would reassess the fair value of the implied goodwill compared to the carrying value 
the company also reviews intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  which primarily consist of trademarks and tradenames  for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  and also if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the reviews consist of comparing estimated fair value to the carrying value 
fair values of the company s trademarks and tradenames are determined primarily by discounting an assumed royalty value applied to projected future revenues associated with the tradename based on management s expectations of the current and future operating environment 
the royalty cash flows are then discounted using rates based on the weighted average cost of capital discussed above and the specific risk profile of the tradenames relative to the company s other assets 
these estimates are impacted by variable factors including inflation  the general health of the economy and market competition 
during fiscal  the company recorded impairment charges of to its acquired trademarks as a result of certain market exits 
during fiscal  the company recorded impairment charges of to its acquired trademarks as a result of its review for impairment 
for the fourth quarter ended february   the review of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment indicated that the fair value for certain acquired trademarks approximated the carrying value of due to the impairment charges recorded in fiscal and the fair value for the remaining of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives substantially exceeds the carrying value 
if the variable factors discussed above change significantly  the company would reassess the fair value of the intangible assets with indefinite useful lives compared to the carrying value 
self insurance liabilities the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  healthcare for certain employees and general and automobile liability costs 
it is the company s policy to record its self insurance liabilities based on management s estimate of the ultimate cost of reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported and related expenses  discounted at a risk free interest rate 
in determining its self insurance liabilities  the company performs a continuing review of its overall position and reserving techniques 
since recorded amounts are based on estimates  the ultimate cost of all incurred claims and related expenses may be more or less than the recorded liabilities 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation  healthcare and general and automobile liability is subject to a degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  discount rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  regulatory changes  benefit level changes and actual claim settlement patterns 
the majority of the self insurance liability for workers compensation is related to claims occurring in california 
california workers compensation has received intense scrutiny from the state s politicians  insurers and providers 
in recent years  there has been an increase in the number of legislative reforms and judicial rulings affecting the handling of claim activity 
the impact of many of these variables on ultimate costs is difficult to estimate 
the effects of changes in such estimated items are included in results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed 
such changes may be material to the results of operations and could occur in a future period 
if  in the future  the company was to experience significant volatility in the amount and timing of cash payments compared to its earlier estimates  the company would assess whether to continue to discount these liabilities 
the company had self insurance liabilities of 
table of contents approximately  net of the discount of  and  net of the discount of  as of february  and february   respectively 
as of february   each basis point change in the discount rate would impact the self insurance liabilities by approximately benefit plans the company sponsors pension and other postretirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
the determination of the company s obligation and related expense for company sponsored pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent  in part  on management s selection of certain actuarial assumptions used in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions include  among other things  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
the discount rate is based on current investment yields on high quality fixed income investments 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the historical experience of the company s investment portfolio and the projected returns by asset category 
over the year period ended february  and february   the average rate of return on plan assets was approximately percent and percent  respectively 
the decrease in the year average rate of return on pension assets was due to the unprecedented decline in the economy and continuing credit market turmoil during fiscal the company expects that the markets will eventually recover to the assumed long term rate of return of percent 
in accordance with accounting standards  actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense and obligations in future periods 
during fiscal  the company contributed to its pension plans and to its postretirement benefit plans  and expects to contribute to its pension plans and to its postretirement benefit plans in fiscal for fiscal  each basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately and each basis point reduction in expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense by approximately similarly  for postretirement benefits  a basis point change in the healthcare cost trend rate would impact the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of the end of fiscal by approximately and the service and interest cost by in fiscal although the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate  the actuarial assumptions may differ from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
in addition  the company contributes to various multi employer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements  primarily defined benefit pension plans 
these plans generally provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers 
based on available information  the company believes that some of the multi employer plans to which it contributes are underfunded 
company contributions to these plans are likely to continue to increase in the near term 
however  the amount of any increase or decrease in contributions will depend on a variety of factors  including the results of the company s collective bargaining efforts  investment return on the assets held in the plans  actions taken by the trustees who manage the plans  and requirements under the pension protection act of and section e of the internal revenue code of  as amended the internal revenue code 
furthermore  if the company were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans at this time  it could trigger a withdrawal liability that would require the company to fund its proportionate share of a plan s unfunded vested benefits 
the company contributed  and to these plans for fiscal  and  respectively 
income taxes the company s current and deferred tax provision is based on estimates and assumptions that could materially differ from the actual results reflected in its income tax returns filed during the subsequent year and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years 

table of contents the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which it expects the differences to reverse 
the company s effective tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
management s judgment is involved in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of any uncertain tax positions 
in addition  the company is currently in various stages of audits  appeals or other methods of review with taxing authorities from various taxing jurisdictions 
the company establishes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in a variety of taxing jurisdictions when  despite management s belief that the company s tax return positions are supportable  certain positions may be challenged and may need to be revised 
the company adjusts these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
the effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to those reserves 
the company also provides interest on these liabilities at the appropriate statutory interest rate 
the actual benefits ultimately realized for tax positions may differ from the company s estimates due to changes in facts  circumstances and new information 
as of february  and february   the company had and of unrecognized tax benefits  respectively 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that it is more likely than not to realize 
forecasted earnings  future taxable income and future prudent and feasible tax planning strategies are considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event the company was not able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  the valuation allowance would be increased 
likewise  if it was determined that the company was more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets  the applicable portion of the valuation allowance would reverse 
the company had a valuation allowance of and as of february  and february   respectively 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to decreased net earnings  adjusted for the impact of non cash impairment charges  depreciation and amortization and lifo expense  substantially offset by the changes in deferred income taxes and operating assets and liabilities 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to changes in deferred income taxes 
net cash used in investing activities was   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to lower capital spending and higher proceeds from the sale of assets 
the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to lower proceeds from the sale of assets 
net cash used in financing activities was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to higher levels of debt reduction 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to higher levels of borrowing 
management expects that the company will continue to replenish operating assets with internally generated funds 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will continue to generate cash flow at current levels 
the company will continue to obtain short term or long term financing from its credit facilities 
long term financing will be maintained through existing and new debt issuances and its credit facilities 
the company s short term and long term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions as opportunities arise 
maturities of debt issued will depend on management s views with respect to the relative attractiveness of interest rates at the time of issuance and other debt maturities 

table of contents certain of the company s credit facilities and long term debt agreements have restrictive covenants and cross default provisions which generally provide  subject to the company s right to cure  for the acceleration of payments due in the event of a breach of the covenant or a default in the payment of a specified amount of indebtedness due under certain other debt agreements 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants and provisions for all periods presented 
on april   the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for an extension of the maturity of portions of the senior secured credit facilities provided under the original credit agreement  which included a five year revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility  a five year term loan term loan a and a six year term loan term loan b 
under the credit agreement   of the revolving credit facility was extended until april  and of term loan b was extended until october  the remaining of the revolving credit facility will expire on june  and the remaining of term loan b will mature on june  the maturity date of term loan a was not extended and will mature on june  the fees and rates in effect on outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement are based on the company s current credit ratings 
borrowings under the non extended portion of the revolving credit facility  if any  carry an interest rate of libor plus percent  borrowings under term loan a carry an interest rate of libor plus percent and borrowings under the non extended portion of term loan b carry an interest rate of libor plus percent 
borrowings under the extended portion of the revolving credit facility  if any  carry an interest rate of libor plus percent and borrowings under the extended portion of term loan b carry an interest rate of libor plus percent 
facility fees under the non extended and extended portions of the revolving credit facility are percent and percent  respectively 
the company pays fees of up to percent on the outstanding balance of the letters of credit issued under the extended revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the extended and non extended term loans may be repaid  in full or in part  at any time without penalty 
the credit agreement reset covenants which are generally less restrictive than the covenants that existed prior to april  specifically  the company must maintain a leverage ratio no greater than to through december   to from december  through december  and to thereafter 
additionally  the company must maintain an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than to through december   to from december  through december  and to thereafter 
all obligations under the senior secured credit facilities are guaranteed by each material subsidiary of the company 
the obligations are also secured by a pledge of the equity interests in those same material subsidiaries  limited as required by the existing public indentures of the company  such that the respective debt issued need not be equally and ratably secured 
in may  the company amended and extended its day accounts receivable securitization program 
the company can borrow up to on a revolving basis  with borrowings secured by eligible accounts receivable  which remain under the company s control 
the facility fee in effect on february   based on the company s current credit ratings  was percent 
the company intends to execute a new program in may as of february   the company had of debt with current maturities that are classified in long term debt in the consolidated balance sheets due to the company s intent to refinance such obligations with the revolving credit facility or other long term debt 
annual cash dividends declared for fiscal  and  were  and per share  respectively 
in october  the board of directors of the company voted to revise the company s dividend policy  with the expectation of reducing the regular quarterly dividend to per share from per share  effective for the dividend payment to stockholders of record on march  the dividend reduction would provide annual cash of approximately the company s dividend policy will continue to emphasize a high level of earnings retention for growth 

table of contents capital spending for fiscal was  including of capital leases 
capital spending primarily included store remodeling activity  new retail stores and technology expenditures 
the company s capital spending for fiscal is projected to be approximately  including capital leases 
fiscal total debt reduction is estimated to be approximately off balance sheet arrangements guarantees the company has guaranteed certain leases  fixture financing loans and other debt obligations of various retailers as of february  these guarantees were generally made to support the business growth of independent retail customers 
the guarantees are generally for the entire terms of the leases or other debt obligations with remaining terms that range from less than one year to years  with a weighted average remaining term of approximately nine years 
for each guarantee issued  if the independent retail customer defaults on a payment  the company would be required to make payments under its guarantee 
generally  the guarantees are secured by indemnification agreements or personal guarantees of the independent retail customer 
the company reviews performance risk related to its guarantees of independent retail customers based on internal measures of credit performance 
as of february   the maximum amount of undiscounted payments the company would be required to make in the event of default of all guarantees was approximately and represented approximately on a discounted basis 
based on the indemnification agreements  personal guarantees and results of the reviews of performance risk  the company believes the likelihood that it will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote 
accordingly  no amount has been recorded in the consolidated balance sheets for these contingent obligations under the company s guarantee arrangements 
the company is contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions 
the company could be required to satisfy the obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations 
due to the wide distribution of the company s assignments among third parties  and various other remedies available  the company believes the likelihood that it will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote
