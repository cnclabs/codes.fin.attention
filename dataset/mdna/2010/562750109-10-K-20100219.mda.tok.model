business overview we are a leading developer and implementer of supply chain software solutions that help organizations optimize their supply chain operations from planning through execution 
our platform based supply chain software solution portfolios manhattan scope and manhattan scale tm are designed to deliver both business agility and total cost of ownership advantages to customers 
manhattan scope supply chain optimization  planning through execution leverages our supply chain process platform scpp to unify the full breadth of the supply chain  while manhattan scale supply chain architected for logistics execution leverages microsoft s 
net platform to unify logistics functions 
early in the company s history  our offerings were heavily focused on warehouse management solutions 
as the company grew in size and scope  its offerings expanded across the entire supply chain 
as a result of the company s historical beginnings however  we still enjoy significant presence in  and a relatively strong concentration of revenues from  warehouse management solutions  which are a component of our distribution management solution suite 
over time  as our non warehouse management solutions have proliferated and increased in capability  the company s revenue concentration in its management warehouse solutions has correspondingly decreased  a trend we expect to see continue 
our business model is singularly focused on the development and implementation of complex supply chain software solutions that are designed to optimize supply chain effectiveness and efficiency for our customers 
we have three principal sources of revenue license revenue generated from the sales of our supply chain software  
table of contents professional services derived from implementing our solutions along with customer support services and software enhancements services  and hardware sales and other revenue 
in  we generated million in total revenue with a revenue mix of license revenues  services  and hardware and other revenue 
we manage our business based on three geographic regions north america and latin america americas  europe  middle east and africa emea  and asia pacific apac 
geographic revenue is based on the location of the sale 
our international revenue was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which represents approximately  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
international revenue includes all revenue derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
at december   we employed approximately  employees worldwide  of which employees are based outside the united states 
of the international employees  approximately  or nearly employees  are located in our india development center 
we have offices in australia  china  france  india  japan  the netherlands  singapore and the united kingdom  as well as representatives in mexico and reseller partnerships in latin america 
global economic trends and industry factors global macro economic trends  technology spending and supply chain management market growth are important barometers for our business 
in  approximately of our total revenue is generated in the united states  in emea and the balance in apac  canada and latin america 
in addition  industry analysts project that approximately two thirds of every supply chain software solutions dollar invested is spent in the united states  consequently  the health of the us economy has a meaningful impact on our financial results 
we sell technology based solutions with total pricing  including software and services  in many cases exceeding million 
reductions in capital budgets of our customers and prospective customers have had an adverse impact on our ability to sell our solutions  largely we believe as a result of the global economic recession 
the deterioration in the current business climate within the united states and geographic regions in which we operate continues to affect customers and prospects decisions regarding timing of strategic capital spend 
timing of deals closed can have a material adverse impact on our business and is likely to further intensify competition in our already highly competitive markets 
in january  the international monetary fund imf provided a world economic outlook update raising its world economic growth forecast 
the update noted that economic growth solidified and broadened to advanced economies in the second half of under the revised outlook  world output is expected to rise by in representing an upward revision of percentage point from the october world economic outlook 
the world economy contracted about in in most advanced economies  the recovery is expected to remain sluggish by past standards  whereas in many emerging and developing economies  activity is expected to be relatively vigorous  largely driven by buoyant internal demand  the update observed  and added that advanced economies are not currently expected to recover to pre crisis levels until moreover  high unemployment rates and public debt  as well as not fully healed financial systems  and in some countries  weak household balance sheets are presenting further challenges to the recovery in these economies  the update continued 
advanced economies are projected to expand sluggishly through much of with annual growth of about  following a contraction of in the us economy contracted about in and is projected to grow in our license revenues in the first half of totaled million down over the first half of as we closed no license deals greater than million 
in contrast  we generated million in total license revenue in the second half of the year 
while this second half result remains down in a year over year comparison  it s down only 
while we saw demand steadily improve in the second half  we believe there continues to be significant uncertainty around the global macro environment regarding consumer demand  federal government policies and the health of credit markets 
we believe companies are continuing to protect their balance sheets by reducing debt and hoarding cash  while continuing to be slower and more cautious regarding strategic capital expenditures 

table of contents revenue license revenue license revenue  a leading indicator of our business  is primarily derived from software license fees that customers pay for supply chain solutions 
in  license revenue totaled million  or of total revenue  with gross margins of 
for the year ended december   americas  emea and apac recognized million  million  and million in license revenue  respectively 
our annual license revenue percentage mix of new to existing customers was approximately to  and over the past three years has averaged about to 
we believe our mix of new customer to existing customer license sales is well balanced  reflecting solid demand from our install base  as well as from new customers in a tough macro economic environment 
license revenue growth is influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions and the competitive position of our software products 
our license revenue generally has long sales cycles of which the timing of the closing of a few large license transactions can have a material impact on our quarterly license revenues  operating profit  operating margins and earnings per share 
for example  million of license revenue in equates to approximately three cents of diluted earnings per share impact 
our software solutions are singularly focused on the supply chain planning and execution markets  which are intensely competitive  rapidly consolidating and characterized by rapid technological change 
we are a market leader in the supply chain management software solutions market as defined by industry analysts such as amr  arc and gartner 
our goal is to extend our position as a leading global supply chain solutions provider by growing our license revenues faster than our competitors 
we do anticipate facing increased competition in the future from erp and scm applications vendors and business application software vendors that may broaden their solution offerings by internally developing or by acquiring or partnering with independent developers of supply chain planning and execution software 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
services revenue our services business consists of professional services consulting and training and customer support services and software enhancements 
in  our services revenue totaled million  or of total revenue  with gross margins of 
the americas  emea and apac realized million  million  and million  respectively  in services revenue for the year ended december  professional services accounted for nearly of total services revenue and approximately of total revenue in when comparing our operating margins to other technology companies  our operating margin profile can be lower due to our large services revenue mix as a percentage of total revenue 
while we believe our services margins are very strong  they do lower our overall operating margin as services margins are lower than license revenue margins 
at december   our consulting services business totaled employees  nearly of our total employees worldwide 
our professional services organization provides our customers with expertise and assistance in planning and implementing our solutions 
to ensure a successful product implementation  consultants assist customers with the initial installation of a system  the conversion and transfer of the customer s historical data onto our system  and ongoing training  education and system upgrades 
we believe our professional services enable customers to implement our software rapidly  ensure the customer s success with our solution  strengthen our customer relationships  and add to our industry specific knowledge base for use in future implementations and product innovations 
although our consulting services are optional  the majority of our customers use at least some portion of these services for the implementation and ongoing support of our software solutions 
consulting services are typically rendered under time and materials based contracts with services typically billed on an hourly basis 
professional services are sometimes rendered under fixed fee based contracts with payments due on specific dates or milestones 
typically  our consulting services lag license revenue by several quarters  as implementation services are performed after the purchase of the software 
services revenue growth is contingent upon license revenue growth  which is influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions and the competitive position of our software products 
in addition  our consulting services business has competitive exposure to offshore providers and other consulting companies 
all of these factors potentially create the risk of pricing pressure  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
for customer support services and software enhancements csse  we offer a comprehensive program that provides our customers with software upgrades when and if available that offer additional or improved functionality and technological advances incorporating emerging supply chain and industry initiatives 
we offer hour customer support every day of the year plus software upgrades for an annual fee that is paid in advance 

table of contents our csse revenues totaled million in  representing approximately of services revenue and approximately of total revenue  respectively 
the growth of csse revenues is influenced by new license revenue growth  annual renewal of support contracts  increase in customers through acquisitions  and fluctuations in currency rates 
substantially all of our customers renew their annual support contracts 
over the last three years  our annual revenue renewal rate of customers subscribing to comprehensive support and enhancements has been greater than 
csse revenue is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  typically months 
csse renewal revenue is not recognized unless payment is received from the customer 
hardware and other revenue our hardware and other revenues totaled million in representing of total revenue with gross margins of 
during  the americas  emea and apac were responsible for million  million  and million  respectively  in hardware and other revenues 
in conjunction with the licensing of our software  and as a convenience for our customers  we resell a variety of hardware products developed and manufactured by third parties 
these products include computer hardware  radio frequency terminal networks  rfid chip readers  bar code printers and scanners  and other peripherals 
we resell all third party hardware products pursuant to agreements with manufacturers or through distributor authorized reseller agreements pursuant to which we are entitled to purchase hardware products at discount prices and to receive technical support in connection with product installations and any subsequent product malfunctions 
we generally purchase hardware from our vendors only after receiving an order from a customer 
as a result  we do not maintain significant hardware inventory 
other revenue represents amounts associated with reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses 
the total amount of expense reimbursement recorded to hardware and other revenue was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
product development we intend to continue to invest significantly in research and development r d  which historically has averaged about cents of every revenue dollar  to provide market leading solutions that help global manufacturers  wholesalers  distributors  retailers and logistics providers successfully manage accelerating and fluctuating demands as well as the increasing complexity and volatility of their local and global supply chains 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
at december   our r d organization totaled approximately employees  located in the us and india  representing about of our total employees worldwide 
we will continue to focus our r d resources on the development and enhancement of supply chain software solutions 
we offer what we believe to be the broadest solution portfolio in the supply chain solutions marketplace  to address all aspects of planning and forecasting  inventory optimization  order lifecycle management  transportation lifecycle management and distribution management 
we also plan to continue to provide enhancements to existing solutions and to introduce new solutions to address evolving industry standards and market needs 
we identify further enhancements to existing solutions and opportunities for new solutions through our customer support organization  as well as through ongoing customer consulting engagements and implementations  interactions with our user groups  association with leading industry analysts and market research firms  and participation on industry standards and research committees 
our solutions address the needs of customers in various vertical markets  including retail  consumer goods  food and grocery  logistics service providers  industrial and wholesale  high technology and electronics  life sciences and government 
cash flow and financial condition for  we generated cash flow from operating activities of million and have generated a cumulative total of million for the three years ended  and our cash and investments at december  totaled million  with no debt on our balance sheet 
we currently have no credit facilities 
during the past three years  our primary uses of cash have been to continue funding of r d investment and operations to drive earnings growth and to repurchase common stock 
in january  our board of directors approved raising our remaining share repurchase authority to million 
in  we anticipate that our priorities for use of cash will be similar to prior years  with our first priority being continued investment in product development and profitably growing our business to extend our market leadership 
we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our product footprint and technology direction 
we will also continue to weigh our share

we do not anticipate any borrowing requirements in for general corporate purposes 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we believe that estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
to the extent there are material differences between those estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions are revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill  accounting for income taxes  stock based compensation  and business combinations 
revenue recognition our revenue consists of revenues from the licensing and hosting of software  fees from implementation and training services collectively  professional services  plus customer support services and software enhancements  and sales of hardware and other other consists of reimbursements of out of pocket expenses incurred by professional services 
all revenue is recognized net of any related sales taxes 
we recognize license revenue when the following criteria are met a signed contract is obtained  delivery of the product has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
revenue recognition for software with multiple element arrangements requires recognition of revenue using the residual method when a there is vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of all undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement that is not accounted for using long term contract accounting  b vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  and c all other applicable revenue recognition criteria for software revenue recognition  other than the requirement for vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each delivered element of the arrangement are satisfied 
for those contracts that contain significant customization or modifications  license revenue is recognized using contract accounting 
we allocate revenue to customer support and software enhancements and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the balance of the revenue  net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement  is recognized at the outset of the arrangement using the residual method as the product licenses are delivered 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on the vsoe of fair value  we defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered  all services have been performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined 
we must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the vsoe of fair value for each element  considering the price charged for each product on a stand alone basis or applicable renewal rates 
the accounting related to license revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules which are subject to change 
our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
if market conditions decline  or if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  we may be unable to determine that collectibility is probable  and we could be required to defer the recognition of revenue until we receive customer payments 
our services revenue consists of fees generated from professional services  customer support services and software enhancements related to our software products 
fees from professional services performed by us are generally billed on an hourly basis  and revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
professional services are sometimes rendered under agreements in which billings are limited to contractual maximums or based upon a fixed fee for portions of or all of the engagement 
revenue related to fixed fee based contracts is recognized on a proportional performance basis based on the hours incurred on discrete projects within an overall services arrangement 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period in which they become known 

table of contents revenue related to customer support services and software enhancements is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  typically months 
hardware and other revenue is generated from the resale of a variety of hardware products  developed and manufactured by third parties that are integrated with and complementary to our software solutions 
as part of a complete solution  our customers periodically purchase hardware from us in conjunction with the licensing of software 
these products include computer hardware  radio frequency terminal networks  radio frequency identification rfid chip readers  bar code printers and scanners and other peripherals 
hardware revenue is recognized upon shipment to the customer when title passes 
we generally purchase hardware from our vendors only after receiving an order from a customer 
as a result  we do not maintain significant hardware inventory 
in accordance with the other presentation matters within the revenue recognition topic of the financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards codification  we recognize amounts associated with reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenue 
such amounts have been included in hardware and other revenue 
the total amount of expense reimbursement recorded to revenue was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credits based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts generally represent a sales allowance on services revenue  which are recorded to operations as a reduction to services revenue 
while such losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with the goodwill and other topic of the fasb accounting standards codification  we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
our goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test  which requires us to estimate the fair value of our business compared to the carrying value 
the impairment reviews require an analysis of future projections and assumptions about our operating performance 
should such review indicate the assets are impaired  we would record an expense for the impaired assets 
annual tests or other future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our goodwill is impaired 
for example  if we had reason to believe that our recorded goodwill had become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the underlying business  we would have to record a charge to income for that portion of goodwill that we believed was impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
at december   our goodwill balance was million 
accounting for income taxes we provide for the effect of income taxes on our financial position and results of operations in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb accounting standards codification 
under this accounting pronouncement  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities resulting from events that are recorded for financial reporting purposes in a different reporting period than recorded in the tax return 
management must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  allowable deductions  projected tax credits and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position 
if the recognition threshold is met  we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than percent likely to be realized 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of operations 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of our net deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the 
table of contents amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of options granted on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
we base our estimate of fair value on certain assumptions  including the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of the price of the underlying share for the expected term of the option  the expected dividends on the underlying share for the expected term  and the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option 
we base our expected volatilities on a combination of the historical volatility of our stock and the implied volatility of publicly traded options issued by third party for our common stock 
due to the limited trading volume of publicly traded options for our common stock  we place a greater emphasis on historical volatility of our common stock 
we also use historical data to estimate the term that options are expected to be outstanding and the forfeiture rate of options granted 
we base the risk free interest rate on the rate for us treasury zero coupon issues with a term approximating the expected term 
we recognize compensation cost for awards with graded vesting using the straight line attribution method  with the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date at least equal to the portion of the grant date value of the award that is vested at that date 
compensation cost recognized in any period is impacted by the number of stock options granted and the vesting period which generally is four years  as well as the underlying assumptions used in estimating the fair value on the date of grant 
this estimate is dependent upon a number of variables such as the number of options awarded  cancelled or exercised and fluctuations in our share price during the year 
in january our compensation committee approved certain changes to our historical equity incentive grant practices  with the objective to optimize its performance and retention strength while managing program share usage to improve long term equity overhang 
the changes eliminate stock option awards in favor of restricted stock grants  which for the awards contain vesting provisions that are service based and performance based 
the awards have a four year vesting period  with the performance portion tied to annual revenue and adjusted earnings per share targets 
business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts and acquired developed technologies  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
in connection with purchase price allocations  we estimate the fair value of the support obligations assumed in connection with acquisitions 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the software products acquired 
we do not include any costs associated with selling efforts  upgrades  or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs 
profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date 
the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination  as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition 
the sum of the costs and operating profit approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation

for the years ended december    and  we capitalized no research and development costs because the costs incurred following the attainment of technological feasibility for the related software product through the date of general release were insignificant 
year compared with year research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries and other personnel related costs for personnel involved in our research and development activities 
consistent with prior years  we typically invest approximately to of total revenue in research and development 
in  research and development expenses decreased to million primarily due to i a million decrease in salary related costs resulting from a decrease in the number of r d personnel  ii a million decrease in bonuses caused by headcount reductions as well as lower achievement of performance based compensation  and iii a million decrease in travel expenses

depreciation and amortization depreciation expense amounted to million  million and million  during   and  respectively  and has decreased due to decreased in capital expenditures 
amortization of intangibles amounted to million  million and million during   and  respectively 
we have recorded goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets as part of the purchase accounting associated with various acquisitions

we reduced the carrying value of the auction rate security investment to zero due to a combination of credit downgrades of the underlying issuer and the bond insurer as well as increased publicly reported exposure to bankruptcy risk by the issuer and continued significant deterioration in the credit markets limiting the issuer s ability to re finance the underlying bond 
we wrote down the remaining balance of our million investment in the company due to a combination of continued negative financial results reported by this company in a very competitive sector and a down round of financing ie  a round of financing that was dilutive to our investment in which our preferred share ownership was converted into common stock  eliminating our preference rights associated with liquidation  thereby substantially impairing our ability to recoup our investment 

table of contents operating income operating income in decreased by million on the consolidated revenue decline of to million compared to million in operating margins improved to in from in primarily due to the decrease in total costs in the current year driven by our actions to lower headcount to align capacity with demand combined with lower performance based compensation expense

the weighted average interest rate earned on cash and investment securities was less than  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we recorded net foreign currency losses of million in and net foreign currency gains of million and million in and  respectively 
the foreign currency loss and gains mainly resulted from loss or gains on intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies with subsidiaries due to the fluctuation of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies  primarily the indian rupee  the british pound and the euro

liquidity and capital resources during   and  we funded our operations through cash generated from operations 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments as compared to million at december  
table of contents our operating activities provided cash of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
cash from operating activities for decreased million compared to due to lower revenue partially offset by strong accounts receivable collections

in january  our board of directors increased our remaining share repurchase authority of million at december  to a total of million 
periodically  opportunities may arise to grow our business through the acquisition of complementary and synergistic companies  products and technologies 
any material acquisition could result in a decrease to our working capital depending on the amount  timing and nature of the consideration to be paid 
we believe that existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs at least for the next twelve months  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
we anticipate that we will be able to continue fund our operations with cash flow from operations in the future 
we do not maintain any bank line of credit 
however  if the company should encounter a need to raise additional capital  recent turmoil in the credit and capital markets could make such capital unavailable or available only at unfavorable costs 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification tm and a new hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  which establishes only two levels of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap authoritative and nonauthoritative 
the fasb accounting standards codification the codification is now the source of authoritative us gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap  except for rules and interpretive releases of the sec  which are additional sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all other nongrandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification will become nonauthoritative 
the codification is effective for financial statements for interim or annual reporting periods ending after september  we adopted the new guidelines and numbering system prescribed by the codification when referring to gaap in the third quarter of as the codification is not intended to change or alter existing gaap for public companies  it does not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on subsequent events 
this guidance is intended to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
specifically  the subsequent events guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods ended after june  we adopted this standard effective june  and have evaluated any subsequent events through the date of this filing 
the adoption of the subsequent events guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on business combinations 
this guidance is significantly changes the accounting for business combinations 
under the business combination guidance  an acquiring entity is required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
this guidance changes the accounting treatment for certain specific acquisition related items  including by requiring the expensing of acquisition 
table of contents related costs as incurred and expensing of restructuring costs associated with an acquired business 
this guidance also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the business combination guidance is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  we expect that this guidance will have an impact on its accounting for future business combinations  but the extent of the impact is dependent upon the number  size  and complexity of acquisitions that we make in the future 
in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on fair value measurements  which establishes a framework for reporting fair value and expands disclosures required for fair value measurements 
the fair value measurement guidance applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  this guidance does not require any new fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
however  in february  the fasb delayed for one year the applicability of fair value measurements to non financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a non recurring basis 
the company partially adopted the fair value measurement on january  related to all financial assets and liabilities and non financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis 
we have adopted fair value measurement for non financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at january  and will continue to apply its provisions prospectively from january  the application of fair value measurement for non financial assets and liabilities did not have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations nor our financial position in off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations our principal commitments as of december  consist of obligations under operating leases 
we expect to fulfill all of the following commitments from our working capital 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of sec rules 
lease commitments we lease our facilities and some of our equipment under noncancelable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through rent expense for these leases aggregated million  million and million during   and  respectively 
the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  in thousands total thereafter non cancelable operating leases indemnifications our sales agreements with customers generally contain infringement indemnity provisions 
under these agreements  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless the customer in connection with patent  copyright or trade secret infringement claims made by third parties with respect to the customer s authorized use of our products and services 
the indemnity provisions generally provide for our control of defense and settlement and cover costs and damages finally awarded against the customer  as well as our modification of the product so it is no longer infringing or  if it cannot be corrected  return of the product for a refund 
our sales agreements with customers sometimes also contain indemnity provisions for death  personal injury or property damage caused by our personnel or contractors in the course of performing services to customers 
under these agreements  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless the customer in connection with death  personal injury and property damage claims made by third parties with respect to actions of our personnel or contractors 
the indemnity provisions generally provide for our control of defense and settlement and cover costs and damages finally awarded against the customer 
the indemnity obligations contained in sales agreements generally have no specified expiration date and no specified monetary limitation on the amount of award covered 
we have not previously incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification obligations 
we account for these indemnity obligations in accordance with fasb guidance on accounting for contingencies  and record a liability for these obligations when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
we have not recorded any liabilities for these agreements as of december  
table of contents warranties we warrant to our customers that our software products will perform in all material respects in accordance with our standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery of the licensed products to the customer for months after first use of the licensed products  but no more than months after execution of the license agreement 
additionally  we warrant to our customers that our services will be performed consistent with generally accepted industry standards or specific service levels through completion of the agreed upon services 
if necessary  we would provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on specific warranty claims and claim history 
however  we have not incurred significant recurring expense under our product or service warranties 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is nominal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign business our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
our international operations currently include business activity out of offices in the united kingdom  the netherlands  france  australia  china  japan  singapore and india 
when the us dollar strengthens against a foreign currency  the value of our sales and expenses in that currency converted to us dollars decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the value of our sales and expenses in that currency converted to us dollars increases 
we recognized a foreign exchange loss of million  in and foreign exchange gains of million and million in and  respectively 
foreign exchange rate transaction gains and losses are classified in other expense income  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
a fluctuation of in the period end exchange rates at december  and relative to the us dollar would result in changes of approximately million and million in the reported foreign currency gain or loss  respectively 
interest rates we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including taxable and tax advantaged floating rate obligations of municipalities  and local  state and national governmental entities and agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are derived from operations 
at december   our cash  cash equivalent  and investments balance totaled million  of which million is liquid 
the remaining investments totaling million are invested in auction rate securities 
our cash equivalent balance at december  was million 
cash equivalents principally consist of highly liquid money market funds with remaining maturities of less than three months when purchased 
these investments are categorized as available for sale securities and recorded at fair market value 
at december   we hold million of investments in auction rate securities  which have original maturities greater than one year  but which have auctions to reset the yield every to days 
the fair values of these auction rate securities considered the credit worthiness of the counterparty  estimates of interest rates  expected holding periods  and the timing and value of expected future cash flows 
changes in the assumptions of our valuation could have a significant impact on the value of these securities  which may cause losses and affect our liquidity specifically for these securities potentially requiring us to record an impairment charge on these investments in the future 
certain auctions failed during and the underlying securities were not redeemed by the issuer 
during  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million on one of these investments reducing the carrying value to zero due to credit downgrades of the underlying issuer and the bond insurer as well as increasing publicly reported exposure to bankruptcy risk by the issuer 
during and  we also recorded temporary impairment charges totaling million on the investments  resulting in million in total auction rate securities investments on the balance sheet at december  the remaining million of auction rate securities held by us at december  were issued by state or regional educational loan authorities and are collateralized by federally insured student loans 
these investments have high credit ratings  and we intend and have the ability to hold these securities until maturity or until called 
the unrealized loss is included as a separate component of shareholders equity and in total comprehensive income 
we will continue to evaluate the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities each reporting period for a potential other than temporary impairment 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce 
table of contents less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate of return on cash and investment securities is less than for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the fair value of cash equivalents and investments held at december  and was million and million  respectively 
based on the average investments outstanding during and  increases or decreases of basis points would result in increases or decreases to interest income of approximately million and million in and  respectively  from the reported interest income
