item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with part i  including matters set forth in the risk factors section of this form k  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii  item of this form k 
certain reclassifications of amounts previously reported have been made to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in order to maintain consistency and comparability between periods presented 
except to the extent that differences among operating segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole  we present the discussion in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on a consolidated basis 
overview autonation  inc  through its subsidiaries  is the largest automotive retailer in the united states 
as of december   we owned and operated new vehicle franchises from stores located in major metropolitan markets  predominantly in the sunbelt region of the united states 
our stores  which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets  sell different brands of new vehicles 
the core brands of vehicles that we sell  representing approximately of the new vehicles that we sold in  are manufactured by toyota  ford  honda  nissan  general motors  mercedes  bmw  and chrysler 
we offer a diversified range of automotive products and services  including new vehicles  used vehicles  parts and automotive repair and maintenance services  and automotive finance and insurance products 
we also arrange financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources 
we believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by  among other things  leveraging our market brands and advertising  improving asset management  implementing standardized processes  and increasing productivity across all of our stores 
as of december   we had three operating segments domestic  import  and premium luxury 
our domestic segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured by general motors  ford  and chrysler 
our import segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by toyota  honda  and nissan 
our premium luxury segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by mercedes  bmw  and lexus 
the franchises in each segment also sell used vehicles  parts and automotive repair and maintenance services  and automotive finance and insurance products 
for the year ended december   new vehicle sales accounted for approximately of our total revenue  but approximately of our total gross margin 
our parts and service and finance and insurance operations  while comprising approximately of total revenue  contributed approximately of our gross margin 
we had net income from continuing operations of million and diluted earnings per share of in  as compared to a net loss from continuing operations of billion and a diluted loss per share of in the results were impacted by a favorable tax adjustment of approximately million  a net gain on asset sales and dispositions of million million after tax  and a gain on senior note repurchases of million million after tax 
see further discussion of these items in note and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the results were impacted by a non cash goodwill impairment charge of billion billion after tax  non cash franchise impairments of million million after tax  a favorable tax adjustment of approximately million  and a gain on senior note repurchases of million million after tax 
market conditions our results for reflected a challenging automotive retail market impacted by the unfavorable economic conditions in the united states  including high economic uncertainty  low consumer confidence  high unemployment  tight credit conditions  and the decline in wealth resulting from depressed housing markets 
in  million new vehicles were sold in the united states 
in comparison  full year us industry new vehicle sales were million in and million in new vehicle sales in the third quarter of benefited from the cash for clunkers program discussed below while the program ran in july and august excluding the vehicles sold under cash for clunkers in the third quarter  the seasonally adjusted annual rate saar improved in the fourth quarter of as compared to the previous three quarters 
while we believe that new vehicle sales will gradually improve in as compared to  we also believe that the automotive retail market will remain challenging and that the annual rate of new vehicle sales will remain depressed by historical standards in in addition  we expect that the decline in new vehicle sales over the past few years  which has led to a decline in the number of recent model year vehicles in operation  our primary service base  may have an adverse impact on our parts and service business for the next several years 

table of contents chrysler and general motors bankruptcies on april   chrysler and several of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code the bankruptcy code 
in connection with the bankruptcy  chrysler filed  and the bankruptcy court approved  a dealer consolidation plan to close approximately dealerships  including seven of our chrysler dealerships 
the bankruptcy court also approved the sale of certain chrysler assets to a new company  chrysler group llc  that will operate the reorganized chrysler business 
on june   chrysler completed the sale  and under the terms approved by the bankruptcy court  the autoworkers union retirement health care trust received approximately of the equity in the new company  fiat approximately fiat s equity interest will increase in increments by up to a total of in the event that certain milestones are achieved  the us treasury approximately  and the government of canada approximately 
chrysler group llc assumed our remaining chrysler franchise agreements under which we will continue to operate our remaining chrysler dealerships that were not terminated in the bankruptcy 
as of december   we had nine chrysler dealerships 
on june   general motors and several of its affiliates also filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
in connection with the bankruptcy  we entered into wind down agreements with general motors pursuant to which we agreed to close four of our dealerships by october in exchange for certain wind down payments 
at the same time  we entered into participation agreements under which our remaining general motors dealerships will continue to operate as franchisees of the new general motors formed as a result of the bankruptcy 
certain of our dealerships with multiple general motors franchises entered into a participation agreement as to certain franchises and a wind down agreement as to other franchises such as pontiac  which general motors is discontinuing as part of the bankruptcy 
on july   the bankruptcy court approved general motors plan to sell certain assets to a new company  general motors company  that will operate the reorganized general motors business  and  on july   general motors completed the sale 
under the terms approved by the bankruptcy court  the us treasury received approximately of the equity in the new company  the autoworkers union retirement health care trust approximately  the governments of canada and ontario approximately  and the old general motors bondholders approximately 
during the third quarter of  we closed all four general motors dealerships referenced above 
as of december   we had general motors dealerships 
the operating results of the chrysler and general motors dealerships that were closed in connection with the bankruptcies were not material to our consolidated financial statements 
see discontinued operations below for a discussion of estimated losses associated with the chrysler and general motors bankruptcies that we recorded in discontinued operations 
cash for clunkers our results of operations for were favorably impacted by the consumer assistance to recycle and save act of  commonly referred to as cash for clunkers  that was enacted at the end of june under the cash for clunkers program  which officially began in july  certain new vehicle buyers who traded in less fuel efficient vehicles were eligible for a credit of up to  from the federal government 
cash for clunkers stimulated consumer demand for new vehicles  and we sold approximately  new vehicles under the program 
since new vehicles with a manufacturer s suggested retail price above  did not qualify under the program  and since each new vehicle sold had to be more fuel efficient than the related trade in vehicle  cash for clunkers disproportionately benefited sales of smaller  more fuel efficient vehicles  primarily in our domestic and import segments 
cash for clunkers officially ended on august  toyota recalls on october   toyota initiated a recall for potential floor mat interference with accelerator pedals  referred to as the pedal entrapment recall  currently covering over million toyota and lexus vehicles 
on january   toyota announced a recall for sticking accelerator pedals  referred to as the accelerator pedal recall  currently covering approximately million toyota vehicles  and  five days later  toyota temporarily suspended sales of the eight new vehicle models covered by the accelerator pedal recall 
in early february  toyota announced that dealers can resume selling vehicles covered by the accelerator pedal recall  to the extent they perform the necessary repairs to address such recall 
on february   toyota announced additional recalls covering model year prius vehicles as well as other toyota and lexus vehicles 
we own a total of toyota and lexus dealerships  and a substantial amount of our toyota vehicle inventory is covered by one or more of these recalls 
while we do not project a material impact on our business from the toyota recalls based on current information  the overall impact is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the recalls will not have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents inventory management our new and used vehicle inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market in our consolidated balance sheets 
we have generally not experienced losses on the sale of new vehicle inventory  in part due to incentives provided by manufacturers to promote sales of new vehicles and our inventory management practices 
we reduced our new vehicle inventory to  units at december   from  units at december  at december   our days supply of new vehicle inventory was days  as compared to days at december  during the first half of  we maintained relatively low new vehicle inventory levels in response to the economic downturn 
as noted above under market conditions  the federal cash for clunkers program stimulated consumer demand for new vehicles during the third quarter of  which impacted our supply of new vehicles 
additionally  the reduced production levels of certain automotive manufacturers during the second quarter of  including the factory shut downs by general motors and chrysler  led to a lower supply of new vehicles in the market generally in the third quarter of during the second half of  we increased our orders for new vehicles to manage our inventory in expectation of increased demand for the fourth quarter of and into we continue to monitor our new vehicle inventory levels closely based on current economic conditions and will adjust them as appropriate 
in general  used vehicles that are not sold on a retail basis are liquidated at wholesale auctions 
we record estimated losses on used vehicle inventory expected to be liquidated at wholesale auctions at a loss 
our used vehicle inventory balance was net of cumulative write downs of million at december   and million at december  parts  accessories  and other inventory are carried at the lower of acquisition cost first in  first out method or market 
we estimate the amount of potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience and market trends 
our parts  accessories  and other inventory balance was net of cumulative write downs of million at december   and million at december  critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations  based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and franchise rights assets are tested for impairment annually on april or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  during  we recorded billion billion after tax of non cash goodwill impairment charges and million million after tax of non cash impairment charges related to franchise rights 
during  we reclassified impairment charges related to franchise rights of million million after tax that were recorded during to loss from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december   as the stores associated with these impairment charges were reclassified to discontinued operations in we completed our annual test for impairment of goodwill on april   and no goodwill impairment charges resulted from the required impairment test 
the goodwill impairment analysis is dependent on many variables used to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income valuation approach  which discounts projected free cash flows dcf of the reporting unit at a computed weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate 
the income valuation approach requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  which include revenue growth rates and future operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  weighted average costs of capital  and future economic and market conditions 
we base our cash flow forecasts on our knowledge of the automotive industry  
table of contents our recent performance  our expectations of our future performance  and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
we also make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step approach 
a first step failure would have required us to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of implied fair value of goodwill and  if required  the recognition of a non cash goodwill impairment charge 
as of december   we allocated million of goodwill to the domestic reporting unit  million to the import reporting unit  and million to the premium luxury reporting unit 
a significant change in the assumptions used to estimate fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the goodwill associated with our reporting units 
the fair values of the domestic  import  and premium luxury reporting units exceeded their carrying values by   and  respectively  as of april   the date of our most recent annual impairment test 
the value of our domestic reporting unit is heavily dependent on the success of the business plans for general motors and  to a lesser extent  chrysler 
as of december   we would have been in compliance with the financial covenants in our debt agreements even if we had impaired all of the goodwill associated with our domestic reporting unit 
we also completed our annual impairment test for intangibles with indefinite lives as of april   and we recorded million million  net of tax of non cash impairment charges related to rights under an import store s franchise agreement 
our franchise rights  which related to franchises and totaled approximately million at april   are evaluated for impairment on a franchise by franchise basis 
if the fair value of each of our franchise rights had been determined to be a hypothetical lower as of the valuation date of april   the resulting incremental impairment charge would have been less than million 
we will continue to monitor events in future periods to determine if additional asset impairment testing should be performed 
we continue to face a challenging automotive retail environment and an uncertain economic environment in general 
as a result of these conditions  there can be no assurance that an additional material impairment charge will not occur in a future period 
long lived assets we estimate the depreciable lives of our property and equipment  including leasehold improvements  and review them for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired 
such events or changes may include a significant decrease in market value  a significant change in the business climate in a particular market  a current expectation that more likely than not a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life  or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses 
when evaluating potential impairment of long lived assets held and used  we first compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group s estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group  we then compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group s estimated fair value to determine if impairment exists 
the fair value measurements for our long lived assets held and used are based on level inputs obtained from third party real estate valuation sources 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information about our fair value measurements 
we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset group s carrying amount exceeds the asset group s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset group becomes its new cost basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset 
using the impairment evaluation methodologies described above  we recorded million during of non cash impairment charges related to our property and equipment held and used in continuing operations to reduce the value of these assets to fair market value 
these charges are recorded as a component of other expenses income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information about our fair value measurements 
when property and equipment is identified as held for sale  we reclassify the held for sale assets to other current assets and cease recording depreciation 
we measure each long lived asset or disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and recognize a loss for any initial adjustment of the long lived asset s or disposal group s carrying amount to fair value less 
table of contents cost to sell in the period the held for sale criteria are met 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if  based on market conditions  the values of these assets should be adjusted 
any subsequent change in the fair value less cost to sell increase or decrease of each asset held for sale is reported as an adjustment to its carrying amount  except that the adjusted carrying amount cannot exceed the carrying amount of the long lived asset at the time it was initially classified as held for sale 
such valuations include estimations of fair values and incremental direct costs to transact a sale 
the fair value measurements for our long lived assets held for sale were based on level inputs obtained from third party real estate valuation sources 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information about our fair value measurements 
as of december   we had assets held for sale of million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations 
during  we recorded net impairment charges of million associated with assets held for sale in continuing operations  which is included in other expenses income  net in the consolidated statements of operations  and million associated with assets held for sale in discontinued operations  which is included in loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future undiscounted cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets 
although we believe our property and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued  the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets 
chargeback reserve revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for i loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed and ii vehicle protection products sold 
we primarily sell these products on a straight commission basis  however we also participate in future underwriting profit on certain extended service contracts pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements  which are recognized as earned 
we may be charged back for commissions related to financing  insurance  or vehicle protection products in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers chargebacks 
these commissions are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles  net of an estimated liability for chargebacks 
we estimate our liability for chargebacks on an individual product basis using our historical chargeback experience  based primarily on cancellation data we receive from third parties that sell and administer these products 
our estimated liability for chargebacks totaled million at december   and million at december  chargebacks are influenced by increases or decreases in early termination rates resulting from cancellation of vehicle protection products  defaults  refinancings  payoffs before maturity  and other factors 
while we consider these factors in the estimation of our chargeback liability  actual events may differ from our estimates  which could result in a change in our estimated liability for chargebacks 
the decline in our liability for chargebacks is largely attributable to lower volume of vehicle sales  partially offset by an increase in customer cancellations of finance and insurance products 
a change in our estimated chargebacks would have changed our estimated liability for chargebacks at december   by approximately million 
see finance and insurance below and note of the notes to consolidated finance statements for further information regarding chargeback liabilities 
revenue recognition revenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles  commissions from related finance and insurance products  sales of parts and services  and sales of other products 
we recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided 
we recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed  the vehicle has been delivered  and payment has been received or financing has been arranged 
rebates  holdbacks  floorplan assistance  and certain other dealer credits received from manufacturers are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program  whichever is later 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding revenue recognition 

table of contents income taxes estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we regularly evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and provide valuation allowances to offset portions of deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding the future realization of such deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
we adjust the valuation allowance in the period we determine it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized 
if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period when the change in circumstances occurs 
accounting for our income taxes also requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes 
effective january   we adopted a standard related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority  based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations 
we adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the completion of a tax audit  expiration of a statute of limitations  the refinement of an estimate  and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed a restructuring of certain of our subsidiaries  a consequence of which was the elimination of a deferred tax liability of million  which was reflected as a benefit in our tax provision for the three months ended december  our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our deferred tax assets or liabilities  the valuation of our uncertain tax positions  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
other additionally  significant estimates have been made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements including allowances for doubtful accounts  accruals related to self insurance programs  certain legal proceedings  estimated losses from disposals of discontinued operations  and certain assumptions related to determining stock based compensation

the decrease in same store unit volume was primarily due to the challenging automotive retail environment  which for much of included reduced credit availability offered to consumers  the discontinuation or limitation of certain manufacturer leasing programs  and low consumer confidence 
the cash for clunkers program discussed above in market conditions favorably impacted results as sales increased during the period the program occurred 
although full year new vehicle sales were lower compared to the prior year  new vehicle sales increased in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in revenue per new vehicle retailed benefited from lower average fuel prices  which caused a shift in mix away from more fuel efficient vehicles that have relatively lower selling prices 
the increase in revenue per new vehicle retailed was also due in part to a recovery in prices for large vehicles  including trucks and sport utility vehicles  as a result of higher demand for such vehicles due to lower average fuel prices and reduced volatility in fuel prices 
same store gross profit per new vehicle retailed increased during  as compared to  due in part to a recovery in margins for large vehicles  including trucks and sport utility vehicles  as a result of higher demand for such vehicles due to lower average fuel prices and reduced volatility in fuel prices

table of contents compared to same store new vehicle revenue decreased billion or during  as compared to  as a result of a decrease in same store unit volume of and a decrease in same store revenue per vehicle retailed of 
these decreases were primarily due to the challenging automotive retail environment  particularly with respect to domestic vehicles 
results were adversely impacted by overall economic conditions  including reduced credit availability offered to consumers  particularly in the second half of  the discontinuation or limitation of certain manufacturer leasing programs  and a decline in consumer confidence 
additionally  volatility in fuel prices impacted consumer preference and caused dramatic swings in consumer demand for various vehicle models  which led to supply and demand imbalances 
the significantly higher fuel prices during most of caused a shift in consumer demand toward more fuel efficient vehicles 
in addition  there was a shift in demand toward entry level premium luxury vehicles as a result of the economic conditions and premium luxury manufacturer programs launching and promoting these types of vehicles during the average revenue per vehicle retailed declined due to the relatively lower selling prices of these vehicles

the decrease in used vehicle sales volumes was driven by the challenging automotive retail environment  including the reduced credit availability offered to consumers  particularly in the second half of  and a decline in consumer confidence 
the decrease in used vehicle sales volumes was also driven in part by a decrease in trade in volume associated with new vehicle sales  as well as a reduction in traffic into our stores resulting from the significant decline in consumer confidence during additionally  volatility in fuel prices impacted consumer preference and caused dramatic swings in consumer demand for various vehicle models  which led to supply and demand imbalances 
the changes in consumer preference in used vehicles created market volatility  which was unprecedented in the industry 
same store gross profit per used vehicle retailed decreased during  as compared to  due to more stringent credit conditions in the automotive retail credit market and increased pricing pressure as a result of a competitive retail environment

table of contents in july  we completed a second amendment of our credit agreement 
under the terms of the second amendment  the interest rate on the term loan facility decreased from libor plus to libor plus and the interest rate on the revolving credit facility decreased from libor plus to libor plus 
additionally  the credit agreement termination date was extended from july   to july   and certain other terms and conditions were modified as a result of this amendment 
we incurred million of expenses in connection with this modification during  which are included as a component of other interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations

the credit spread charged for the revolving credit facility and term loan facility is impacted by our senior unsecured credit ratings from standard poor s bb  with stable outlook and moody s ba  with stable outlook 
for instance  under the current terms of our amended credit agreement  a one notch downgrade of our senior unsecured credit rating by either standard poor s or moody s would result in a basis point increase in the credit spread under our term loan facility  a basis point increase in the credit spread under our revolving credit facility  and a basis point increase in the facility fee applicable to our revolving credit facility 
credit ratings and or outlook could be lowered if new vehicle demand worsens significantly  threatening our earnings and cash flow  or if we increase our financial leverage through acquisitions or share repurchases 
credit ratings and or outlook could improve if market demand increases or if we demonstrate our ability to reduce our financial leverage and preserve our ability to generate cash flow while maintaining moderate financial policies 
vehicle floorplan payable vehicle floorplan payable trade totaled billion at december   and billion at december  vehicle floorplan payable trade reflects amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new vehicle inventories with manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries 
vehicle floorplan payable non trade totaled million at december   and million at december   and represents amounts borrowed to finance the purchase of specific new and  to a lesser extent  used vehicle inventories with non trade lenders 
all the floorplan facilities utilize libor based interest rates 
floorplan facilities are due on demand  but in the case of new vehicle inventories  are generally paid within several business days after the related vehicles are sold 
our manufacturer agreements generally require that the manufacturer have the ability to draft against the new floorplan facilities so the lender directly funds the manufacturer for the purchase of new vehicle inventory 
floorplan facilities are primarily collateralized by vehicle inventories and related receivables 
other debt on august   we repaid million of senior unsecured notes that matured on that date 
at december   we had million outstanding under a mortgage facility with an automotive manufacturer s captive finance subsidiary 
the mortgage facility was refinanced under a new facility in november to provide a fixed interest rate and provide financing secured by year mortgages on certain of our store properties

for example  under the amended credit agreement  we are required to remain in compliance with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio  as defined 
in march  we amended our credit agreement to provide that non cash impairment losses associated with goodwill and intangible assets as well as certain other non cash charges would be excluded from the computation of the maximum consolidated leverage ratio 
we are also required to remain in compliance with a maximum capitalization ratio  as defined 
in addition  the indenture for the floating rate and senior unsecured notes contains a debt incurrence restriction based on a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  and the mortgage facility contains covenants regarding maximum cash flow leverage and minimum interest coverage 
the indenture for our floating rate and senior unsecured notes restricts our ability to make payments in connection with share repurchases  dividends  debt retirement  investments  and similar matters to a cumulative aggregate amount that is limited to million plus of our cumulative consolidated net income as defined in the indenture since april   the net proceeds of stock option exercises  and certain other items  subject to certain exceptions and conditions set forth in the indenture 
our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt agreements could permit acceleration of all of our indebtedness 
our debt agreements have cross default provisions that trigger a default in the event of an uncured default under other material indebtedness of autonation 
as of december   we were in compliance with the requirements of all applicable financial covenants under our debt agreements  our consolidated leverage ratio was approximately and our capitalization ratio was  each as defined in our credit agreement 
both the consolidated leverage ratio and the capitalization ratio limit our ability to incur additional non vehicle debt 
the capitalization ratio also limits our ability to incur additional floorplan indebtedness 
to the extent that in the future we believe that we will be unable to comply with the covenants in our amended credit agreement  we will seek an amendment or waiver of our amended credit agreement  which could increase the cost of our debt 
we may also consider other options  such as raising capital through an equity issuance to pay down debt  which could be dilutive to stockholders 
see the risk factor our revolving credit facility  term loan facility  mortgage facility  and the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes contain certain financial ratios and other restrictions on our ability to conduct our business in part i  item a  of this form k 
in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings  none of the covenants described above would be impacted 
in addition  availability under the amended credit agreement described above would not be impacted should a downgrade in the senior unsecured debt credit ratings occur 
certain covenants in the indenture for the floating rate and senior unsecured notes would be eliminated with an upgrade of our senior unsecured notes to investment grade by either standard poor s or moody s

however  revenue may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by actual or threatened severe weather events and by other factors unrelated to weather conditions  such as changing economic conditions and automotive manufacturer incentive programs
