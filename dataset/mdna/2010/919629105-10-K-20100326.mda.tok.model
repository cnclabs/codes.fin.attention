item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company as of and for the years ended december  and the purpose of this discussion is to focus on important factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes to assist in the evaluation of our performance 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
those accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and uncertainties include the allowance for loan losses and impaired loans 
further information about these critical policies is described below 
certain credit risks are inherent in making loans 
we seek to prudently assess these risks and manage them effectively 
we have internal credit policies and procedures in place to reduce repayment risks 
these policies and procedures include officer and customer limits  periodic loan documentation review  and follow up on exceptions to credit policies 
we establish the allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings through a provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe that the collection of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries of losses previously charged against the allowance are credited to the allowance 
the allowance represents an amount that  in our judgment  will be appropriate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
some of the factors we consider in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses are as follows an evaluation of the current loan portfolio  identified loan problems  loan volume outstanding  past loss experience  present and expected industry and economic conditions and  in particular  how such conditions relate to our market area  problem loan trends over a year historical time period  and loan growth trends over a year historical time period the general component of the reserve covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors 
an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect our estimate of probable losses 
it also reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management 
on a quarterly basis  we perform a detailed analysis of the allowance for loan losses to verify the adequacy and appropriateness of the allowance in meeting possible losses in the loan portfolio 
we use generally accepted accounting standards related to receivables and contingencies when segregating our portfolio into loans classified as impaired and non impaired loan pools and in analyzing our current portfolio to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
included in our potentially impaired loan category are our current watch list credits plus any additional credits which have been past due three or more times within the past month period 
we individually review these potentially impaired loans based on generally accepted accounting standards related to receivables and make a determination if the loan in fact is impaired 
we consider a loan impaired when we determine that is probable that we will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
we do not consider a loan impaired during a period of delay in payment if we expect the ultimate collection of all amounts due 
if it is found to be impaired  an allowance is established when the collateral value  discounted cash flows  or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
we recognize any impairment by creating a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses or by adjusting an existing valuation allowance for the impaired loan with a corresponding charge or credit to bad debt expense 
the valuation allowance becomes our specific reserve for the specific loan 
we take the balance of our portfolio and add back to it any loans that were included in the potentially impaired loan category but that were found not to be impaired 
we then segregate the remaining portfolio into specific categories based on type of loan and review the groups of loans to estimate loss under generally accepted accounting standards based on contingencies 
we apply a specific loss factor to each category based upon our historical loss experience for each category of loans over the current two years ending december  the loss factor is multiplied by the outstanding balance in the loan category to estimate potential loss for our allowance for loan losses 
we then evaluate certain environmental and qualitative factors that are relevant to our portfolio a nd make a risk assessment of low  medium  or high for each factor 
an additional loss factor is assigned to the portfolio according to the risk assessment 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  because it requires estimates that may be significantly revised as more information becomes available 
bank regulators also periodically review the loan portfolio and other assets to assess their quality  and we employ independent  third party loan reviewers as well 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may be significantly revised as more information becomes available 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for expected losses in the loan portfolio  but there are no assurances that it will be 
performance summary for the year ended december   valley financial reported net loss to common shareholders of million compared with net income to common shareholders of million for the same twelve months of our earnings for the year produced an annualized return on average total assets of and an annualized return on average shareholders equity of  compared to prior year ratios of and  respectively 
diluted earnings losses per share were down from in to in like most financial institutions  we have increased our allowance for loan and lease losses to unprecedented levels during as a result of the continued depressed economy and its impact on our local customers and the more conservative approach regulators are taking towards loan loss reserves in this difficult economic environment 
the company s loan loss provision was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period last year 
we continue to see weaknesses in the residential and commercial real estate markets as sales activity remains stalled in our market 
as a result  we charged off million in impaired real estate relationships during the fourth quarter of we believe the increase in our total reserves is adequate given the continued depressed economic environment at december  we anticipate our reserves will remain elevated into  as the general state of the economy will dictate future reserves 
the following table shows our key performance ratios for the years ended december  and key performance ratios months ended months ended return on average assets return on average equity net interest margin cost of funds yield on earning assets basic net earnings per share diluted net earnings per share all percentage calculations are on an annualized basis 
the calculation of return on average equity roe excludes the effect of any unrealized gains or losses on investment securities available for sale 
calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis fte 
non gaap financial measures the company measures the net interest margin as an indicator of profitability 
the net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets 
because a portion of interest income earned by the company is nontaxable  the tax equivalent net interest income is considered in the calculation of this ratio 
tax equivalent net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit realized from interest income that is nontaxable to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense 
the tax rate utilized in calculating the tax benefit for and is 
the reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income  which is not a measurement under gaap  to net interest income  is reflected in the table below

total assets at december  were million  up million or from million at december  the principal components of the company s assets at the end of were million in securities available for sale  including restricted equity securities  million in securities held to maturity  and million in gross loans 
total liabilities at december  were million  up from million at december   an increase of million or 
deposits increased million or to million from the million level at decemfber  our deposit growth for was outstanding due to the innovative and exciting suite of products and exceptional level of customer service offered to our customers 
we were successful in growing our core deposits by during and are heavily focused on continuing this trend in we have recently rolled out a new savings account that is tied to our my lifestyle checking rewards checking account that offers an attractive rate and an automatic method for savings 
our preliminary results with this product have been phenomenal 
total liabilities at december  were million  up from million at december   an increase of million or 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity at december  was million  a decrease of million or over the million level at december   which is primarily attributable to the net loss of million and the million in preferred dividends declared to the us treasury 
total shareholders equity at december  was million  an increase of million or over the million level at december   which is primarily attributable to the issuance of preferred stock and warrants to the treasury under the capital purchase plan

the decline in earnings is largely attributable to the recessionary environment and its impact on asset quality 
loan loss provisions of million were recorded in  an increase of million over the million in loan loss provisions for the same month period in net loss for the three months ended december  was million  a decrease of million over the net loss of million reported for the fourth quarter of while net interest income was million above the amount earned for the fourth quarter of  this increase was offset by additional loan loss provisions of million  a loss on the sale of foreclosed assets of million  and increased fdic insurance expense of million 
after deducting the dividends and discount accretion on preferred stock  net loss to common shareholders for the quarter ending december  amounted to million as compared to million for the fourth quarter of we earned net income million for the year ended december   a decrease of million as compared to the million net income reported for the same period in net loss for the three months ended december  was million  a decrease of million as compared to the net income of million reported for the fourth quarter of net interest income net interest income  our primary source of revenue  is the excess of interest income over interest expense 
net interest income is influenced by a number of factors  including the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest rates earned on earning assets  and the interest rates paid to obtain funding to support the assets 
for analytical purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to recognize the income tax savings on tax exempt assets  such as bank owned life insurance boli and municipal securities and loans 
a tax rate of was used in adjusting interest on boli  tax exempt securities and loans to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
the difference between rates earned on interest earning assets with an adjustment made to tax exempt income to provide comparability with taxable income  ie the fte adjustment and the cost of the supporting funds is measured by the net interest margin 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  a million  or  increase when compared to the million reported for the same period in the federal reserve open market committee fomc  which sets the federal funds rate  kept rates at extremely low levels throughout due to the global economic recession over the last months  deflating both the yield on our earning assets and our cost of funds 
in  the fomc decreased the target funds rate five times for a total of basis points which resulted in the historically low federal funds rate of which was held constant throughout the tax equivalent yield on earning assets decreased basis points during the year  from in to in the yield on average loans decreased basis points  from in to in the cost of funds including noninterest bearing deposits decreased basis points  from in to in as a result of the above movements  our net interest margin improved by basis points to for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period last year 
net interest income for the quarter ended december  was million  a million increase when compared to the million reported for the same period in  resulting in a net interest margin for the fourth quarter of  up basis points as compared to in the fourth quarter of last year 
the improvement in our net interest margin for both periods is due primarily to our exceptional core deposit growth in  which afforded us the opportunity to allow our higher cost certificates of deposit to roll off at maturity 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  a increase when compared to the million reported for the same period in net interest income for the quarter ended december  was million  a million increase when compared to the million reported for the fourth quarter of the following table presents the major categories of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity with corresponding average balances  related interest income or expense  and resulting yields and rates for the periods indicated

loan interest income includes loan fees of million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
nontaxable interest income is adjusted to its fully taxable equivalent basis using a federal tax rate of percent 
the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income tax equivalent basis by average total earning assets 
non accrual loans are included in the above yield calculation 
as discussed above  the company s net interest income is affected by the change in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities referred to as volume change as well as by changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds referred to as rate change 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  a summary of changes in interest income and interest expense for the major categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the amounts of change attributable to variations in volumes and rates 
changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and rate  respectively

our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
our primary objectives for managing interest rate volatility is to identify opportunities to maximize net interest income while ensuring adequate liquidity and carefully managing interest rate risk 
the asset liability management committee alco  which is comprised of executive officers  is responsible for monitoring corporate financial performance  meeting liquidity requirements  establishing interest rate parameters  indices  and terms for loan and deposit products  assessing and evaluating the competitive market environment  monitoring and measuring interest rate risk 
interest rate risk refers to the exposure of our earnings and market value of portfolio equity mve to changes in interest rates 
the magnitude of the change in earnings and mve resulting from interest rate changes is impacted by the time remaining to maturity on fixed rate obligations  the contractual ability to adjust rates prior to maturity  competition  and the general level of interest rates and customer actions 
there are several common sources of interest rate risk that must be effectively managed if there is to be minimal impact on our earnings and capital 
repricing risk arises largely from timing differences in the pricing of assets and liabilities 
reinvestment risk refers to the reinvestment of cash flows from interest payments and maturing assets at lower or higher rates 
basis risk exists when different yield curves or pricing indices do not change at precisely the same time or in the same magnitude such that assets and liabilities with the same maturity are not all affected equally 
yield curve risk refers to unequal movements in interest rates across a full range of maturities 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  alco reviews the changes in net interest income and mve given various changes in interest rates 
we also consider the most likely interest rate scenarios  local economics  liquidity needs  business strategies  and other factors in determining the appropriate levels of interest rate risk 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  simulation analysis is used to determine the impact on net interest income and mve from changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity analysis presents the amount of assets and liabilities that are estimated to reprice through specified periods if there are no changes in balance sheet mix 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis in the table below reflects our assets and liabilities on december  that will either be repriced in accordance with market rates  mature  or are estimated to mature early or prepay within the periods indicated in thousands 
this is a one day position that is continually changing and is not necessarily indicative of our position at any other time 
interest rate sensitivity maturities repricing in s december  months months months over months total earning assets loans  excluding nonaccruals investment securities restricted equity securities interest bearing deposits in banks total earning assets interest bearing liabilities now accounts money market accounts savings time deposits total deposits repurchase agreements fhlb advances guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in the company s junior subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative ratio of sensitivity gap to total earning assets at least quarterly  we measure the asset liability management position using earnings simulation modeling to estimate what assets and liabilities would re price  and to what extent  within a one year period in response to an immediate  and basis point change in the prime rate  as well as in response to more gradual interest rate changes 
our objective is to keep the change in net interest income over twelve months at or below under an immediate basis point interest rate shock scenario and to keep the change in net income at or below  under an immediate basis point interest rate shock scenario 
we also estimate interest sensitivity by calculating the net present value of the balance sheet s cash flows or the residual value of future cash flows ultimately due to sh areholders 
this calculation is known as economic value of equity or eve and is generally considered a better measure of long term interest sensitivity than the interest rate shock scenarios 
our objective is for the result to change or less in an immediate basis point interest rate shock scenario 
the model also incorporates management s forecasts for balance sheet growth  noninterest income and noninterest expense 
the interest rate scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management s view of future market movements 
rather  these are intended to provide a measure of the degree of volatility interest rate movements may apply to our earnings 
modeling the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate risk is highly dependent on numerous assumptions embedded in the simulation model 
while the earnings sensitivity analysis incorporates management s best estimate of interest rate and balance sheet dynamics under various market rate movements  the actual behavior and resulting earnings impact likely will differ from that p rojected 
derivative financial instruments for asset liability management purposes  we may use interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate risk exposure to declining rates 
such derivatives are used as part of the asset liability management process and are linked to specific assets  and have a high correlation between the contract and the underlying item being hedged  both at inception and throughout the hedge period 
at december  and the company did not have any derivative agreements related to interest rate hedging in place 
non interest income non interest income is made up of the following major components for december  and in s months ended months ended increase decrease service charges on deposits income earned on life insurance contracts realized gains losses on sale of securities realized gains losses on sale of foreclosed assets other income total noninterest income as noted in the above table  non interest income for the year ended december  was million   or above the same period last year 
we recorded gains on the sale of securities of million during the year as the result of an investment portfolio restructuring transaction to increase overall liquidity and to better position our portfolio for a rising rate environment 
offsetting this gain was a loss recorded on the sale of foreclosed assets of million 
as a result  our core noninterest income excluding gains losses on investments  foreclosed assets  and equipment totaled million as compared to million for  a decrease of  or 
this decline is largely attributable to a reduction in income earned from our investment subs idiary  valley wealth management services  inc non interest expense months ended months ended increase in s decrease compensation occupancy and equipment data processing advertising and marketing insurance audit fees legal fees franchise tax expense deposit expense loan expense computer software foreclosed asset expenses  net other expense total noninterest expense non interest expense for the year ended december  increased by a total of million or over the same period in  from million to million 
a few items to note are as follows data processing expenses have increased based on an increase in transactional processing costs as a result of the rapid growth of transactional deposits accounts and internet banking 
our advertising and marketing costs decreased from year to year by as a result of the new product advertising that was launched during for my lifestyle checking 
we did not launch any new products in like most community banks  we experienced significant increases in deposit insurance costs due to the fdic s efforts to replenish the deposit insurance fund during the past year 
in the second quarter of  the company accrued  in expenses related to a special fdic assessment levied on the entire banking industry during that same time frame 
we anticipate these expenses to continue to increase due to the current economic environment and the increasing number of bank failures across the industry 
audit fees increased in as we moved back to an outsourced internal audit environment at the beginning of as discussed in the annual report  this change created a net savings to the company s overall non interest expense due to savings in compensation and software expenses that were greater than the increased audit fees 
legal fees increased dramatically due to issues surrounding the work out of problem assets and litigation costs 
deposit expenses increased primarily due to program fees related to wholesale and brokered deposits  certificate of deposit account registry service cdars certificates of deposits and our mylifestyle deposit suite of products 
the decrease in loan expense is primarily due to the lower loan growth in as compared to foreclosed asset expenses increased in as we foreclosed on and carried on our balance sheet numerous real estate properties during the year 
these expenses include fees incurred to foreclose on the asset and expenses incurred to keep the property in a favorable condition 
noninterest expense for the year ended december  was million over the same period ended december  for the year ended december   we experienced an increase in compensation expenses due to merit increases  new positions in our commercial lending departments and the full year s impact of our movement to an internal audit environment in early we renovated and occupied a new floor at our main headquarters in early resulting in an increase in occupancy expense over the prior period 
there was an increase in data processing expense based on the bank s conversion to an image item processing environment 
audit fees decreased due to our conversion to an internal audit department within the bank 
deposit expenses increase d significantly as we experienced elevated participation in our cdars program that caused increases in related program fees 
computer software expenses increased primarily due to software related to our mylifestyle product suite as well as new loan documentation software 
noninterest expenses are expected to continue to increase as a direct result of business growth  the continuation of the depressed local economy  the complexity of banking operations and the potential for increased levels of regulations 
income taxes during and  the company recorded federal income tax benefit of million and an income tax provision of million  respectively 
the anticipated federal income tax liability equates to an effective tax rate of and  respectively 
a few of the factors contributing to the difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory rate of percent include historical tax credits  tax exempt interest income on municipal securities  net of disallowance  and tax exempt income earned on bank owned life insurance

our policy is to invest primarily in securities of the us government and its agencies and in other high grade fixed income securities to minimize credit risk 
our investment securities portfolio plays a role in the management of interest rate sensitivity and generates additional interest income 
in addition  our portfolio serves as a source of liquidity and is used to meet collateral requirements 
our investment securities portfolio consists of two components  securities held to maturity and securities available for sale 
securities are classified as held to maturity based on our intent and ability  at the time of purchase  to hold such securities to maturity 
these securities are carried at amortized cost 
securities which may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates  changes insecurities prepayment risk  increases in loan demand  general liquidity needs  and other similar factors are classified as available for sale and are carried at estimated fair value 
investment securities available for sale and held to maturity  including restricted equity securities  at december  were million  a decrease of million or from their level of million on december  the decrease is attributable to purchases of million offset by principal prepayments  called proceeds and sales and net amortization accretion in the amount of million

loan portfolio our total gross loans were million at december   an increase of million or from the million reported one year earlier 
our ratio of total loans to total funding sources  excluding the federal reserve discount window  customer deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  federal funds purchased  federal home loan bank advances  and trust preferred securities stood at at december  and at december  management seeks to maintain the ratio of loans to funding sources at or below 
in addition to the funding sources noted above  at december  the company has a secured line of credit with the federal reserve discount window for million 
the loan portfolio primarily consists of commercial  real estate including real estate term loans  construction loans and other loans secured by real estate and loans to individuals for household  family and other consumer purposes 
we adjust the mix of lending and the terms of our loan programs according to economic and market conditions  asset liability management considerations and other factors 
loans typically are made to businesses and individuals located within our primary market area target range  most of whom maintain deposit accounts with the bank 
there is no concentration of loans exceeding of total loans that is not disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements or discussed below 
the following table summarizes the loan portfolio by category for the five years ended december  loan portfolio summary in s year ended december commercial commercial real estate real estate construction residential real estate loans to individuals except those secured by real estate total loans the following table presents maturity information based upon interest rate repricing dates on the loan portfolio based upon scheduled repayments at december  loan maturity in s december  due within one year due one to five years due after five years total commercial commercial real estate real estate construction residential real estate loans to individuals total loans the following table presents maturity information based upon contractual terms and scheduled repayments at december  fixed and variable rate loans in s fixed variable due within five years due after five years due within five years due after five years commercial commercial real estate real estate construction residential real estate loans to individuals total loans loan category analysis commercial loans 
commercial loans generally are made to provide operating lines of credit  to finance the purchase of inventory or equipment  and for other business purposes 
the credit worthiness of the borrower is analyzed and re evaluated on a periodic basis 
most commercial loans are secured with business assets such as accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
even with substantial collateral  such as all the assets of the business and personal guarantees  commercial lending involves considerable risk of loss in the event of a business downturn or failure of the business 
commercial real estate loans 
commercial real estate construction and commercial real estate mortgages represent interim and permanent financing of commercial properties that are secured primarily by real estate 
the company prefers to make commercial real estate loans secured by owner occupied properties 
these borrowers are engaged in business activities other than real estate  and the primary source of repayment is not solely dependent on conditions in the real estate market 
real estate construction loans 
real estate construction loans represent interim financing on residential and commercial properties under construction  and are secured by real estate 
this category also includes acquisition and development financing for residential and commercial projects 
once construction is completed and the loan becomes permanent  the loans are reclassified as either commercial real estate loans  which are secured by commercial property  or residential real estate loans  which are secured by first deeds of trust 
residential real estate loans 
residential real estate loans are secured by deeds of trust on family residential properties 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the company usually limits the final maturity of residential real estate loans held for its own portfolio to years  although exceptions are made for competitive reasons and under special programs 
residential real estate lending involves risk elements when there is lack of timely payment and or a decline in the value of the collateral 
loans to individuals 
we offer various secured and unsecured consumer loans  including unsecured personal loans and lines of credit  automobile loans  deposit account loans  installment and demand loans  letters of credit  and home equity loans 
higher risk loans certain types of loans  such as option arm products  interest only loans  subprime loans  and loans with initial teaser rates  can have a greater risk of non collection than other loans 
we have not offered option arm  interest only  or subprime mortgage loans 
the only initial teaser rate product we have offered have been loan to value home equity lines of credit 
this teaser rate product was introduced in mid to stimulate activity and was terminated in late junior lien mortgages can also be considered higher risk loans and our junior lien portfolio currently consists of balances totaling million of total portfolio at december  loans included in this category that were initially made with high loan to value ratios of or greater have current balances totaling million and have current loan to value ratios of or less at december  over the past seven years  we have experienced charge offs totaling  in junior lien mortgages 
additionally  we have residential first mortgages with balances approximating million that are at current loan to value ratios in excess of 
we have not experienced any charge offs of loans in this category 
asset quality summary of allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents an amount that  in our judgment  will be adequate to absorb any losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible  although there can be no assurance that this will be so 
the provision for loan losses increases the allowance  and loans charged off net of recoveries reduce the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding was approximately at december   which compares to approximately of total loans at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are primarily based on our historical loss experience  portfolio concentrations  evaluation of individual loans and economic conditions 
a total of million in specific reserves was included in the balance of the allowance for loan losses as of december  for impaired loans  which compares to a total of million as of december  a provision for loan losses of million was made during  an increase of million or from the million provided during the increase in the loan loss provision is a result of the following factors an overall increase in our general reserves of million 
we included two new environmental factors due to the catastrophic devaluation that is occurring in the real estate market 
like many community banks  we are focused heavily on real estate lending and as such believe it is prudent to recognize an additional environmental factor associated with real estate lending in the current economic environment 
we also added a new environmental factor to account for the concentration of larger relationships in our portfolio 
these new factors resulted in an increase of million to the general reserves 
our historical loss factor increased from at december  to at december  due to the unprecedented high level of charge offs during the past two years upon which our analys is is based 
this increase added million to our general reserves 
the remaining increase to our general reserves is the result of provisions made due to our loan growth 
an increase in our specific reserves on our impaired assets of million 
the increase is primarily attributable to the ongoing economic recession throughout the roanoke valley and the depressed levels of asset prices 
the majority of loans carrying specific reserves for potential losses at december  are residential or commercial real estate relationships 
we believe the increase in our total reserves is adequate and appropriate given the continued depressed economic environment at december  we anticipate provisioning levels to continue to be elevated for and the levels will depend on the depth and strength of any potential recovery from the current recession 
a provision for loan losses of million was made during  an increase of million or from the million provided during the increase in the loan loss provision was a result of an increase in loan growth as well as large specific reserves on one large commercially oriented credit relationship 
loans are assigned to our watch list based upon our internal risk rating system 
there are three levels of accountability in the risk rating process 
the primary responsibility for risk identification lies with the account officer 
it is the account officer s responsibility for the initial and ongoing risk rating of all notes and commitments in his or her portfolio 
on a monthly basis  each account officer signs a credit risk rating certification attesting to the accuracy of the credit risk ratings for the loans in his or her loan portfolio 
the chief credit officer is responsible for periodically reviewing the risk rating process employed by the lending officers 
the chief credit officer is responsible for the accuracy and timeliness of account officer risk ratings and has the authority to override account officer risk ratings and initiate rating changes  if warranted 
finally  the bank has a loan review program to provide an independent validation of portfolio quality 
this independent review is intended to assess adherence to underwriting guidelines  proper credit analysis and documentation 
in addition  the loan review process is required to test the integrity  accuracy and timeliness of account officer r isk ratings and to test the effectiveness of the credit administration s controls over the risk identification process 
risk management reports its findings to the board of directors 
we regularly review asset quality and re evaluate the allowance for loan losses 
however  no assurance can be given that unforeseen adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased provisions in the future 
our current market environment  with a nationwide recession  makes this risk even higher 
additionally  regulatory examiners may require us to recognize additions or reductions to the allowance based upon their judgment about the loan portfolio and other information available to them at the time of their examinations 
on a quarterly basis  the directors loan committee will review all loans on our watch list to determine proper action and reporting of any loans identified as substandard by the credit quality review 
a dditionally  the directors loan committee and the audit committee meet jointly at the end of each quarter to review in detail management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
we believe that the above allocated reserves are adequate for the impaired loans in our portfolio based upon a detailed review of the quality and pledged collateral of each individual loans considered impaired at each of the above referenced periods 
the following table summarizes the loan loss experience for the five years ended december  analysis of the allowance for loan losses in s year ended december  balance at january recoveries commercial residential real estate loans to individuals charged off loans commercial commercial real estate residential real estate real estate construction loans to individuals net charge offs additions charged to operations balance at december ratio of net charge offs during the period to average loans outstanding during the period the following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the five years ended december  the percentage in the table below refers to the percent of loans in each category to total loans 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses in s year ended december  balance at end of period applicable to commercial commercial real estate real estate construction residential real estate loans to individuals total allowance non performing assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and foreclosed repossessed property 
a loan will be placed on nonaccrual status when collection of all principal or interest is deemed unlikely 
a loan will be placed on nonaccrual status automatically when principal or interest is past due days or more  unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of being collected 
in this case  the loan will continue to accrue interest despite its past due status 
a restructured loan is a loan in which the original contract terms have been modified due to a borrower s financial condition or there has been a transfer of assets in full or partial satisfaction of the loan 
a modification of original contractual terms is generally a concession to a borrower that a lending institution would not normally consider 
based on generally accepted accounting standards for receivables  a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is likely that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts  including both principal and interest  due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
for the year ended december   our non performing assets to total assets ratio increased from at december  to 
non performing assets at december  consisted of non accrual loans of million and foreclosed property of million 
also included in non performing assets at december  are loans totaling  that are past due greater than days 
at this time  we believe we are adequately reserved for any potential loss exposure on these relationships 
our ratio of loans past due more than days to total loans decreased from at december  to at december  net charge offs for the year ended december  amounted to million in comparison to million for the year ended december  charge offs of million recorded in are related to one commercial customer who took adversarial actions against the company during the first half of for the year ended december   our non performing assets to total assets ratio increased from at december  to 
additionally  our ratio of loans past due more than days to total loans increased from at december  to at december  net charge offs for the year ended december  amounted to million in comparison to million for the year ended december  nonperforming assets for the five years ended december  are detailed as follows nonperforming assets in s december  nonaccrual loans loans past due days or more restructured loans other nonperforming loans total nonperforming loans foreclosed  repossessed and idled properties total nonperforming assets other nonperforming loans include impaired loans which are not on nonaccrual status  nor past due days or more 
if the non accrual loans disclosed above had performed in accordance with their original terms  additional interest income in the amount of  and  would have been recorded for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
other assets we have purchased life insurance contracts on key employees  the tax exempt income from which is the funding vehicle for the company s supplemental executive retirement plan serp and other employee benefit costs including health insurance  dental insurance  life insurance  and k employer match 
bank owned life insurance was million at december   an increase of million over the million reported as of december  the increase is due to the million increase in the cash surrender value of the life insurance contracts record as income 
deposits our major source of funds and liquidity is our deposit base 
deposits provided funding for our investment in loans and securities 
our primary objective is to increase core deposits as a means to fund asset growth at a lower cost 
interest paid for deposits must be managed carefully to control the level of interest expense 
we offer individuals and small to medium sized businesses a variety of deposit accounts  including checking  savings  money market and certificates of deposits 
the levels and mix of deposits are influenced by such factors as customer service  interest rates paid  service charges and the convenience of banking locations 
competition for deposits is intense from other depository institutions and money market funds  some of which offe r interest rates higher than we pay 
we attempt to identify and implement pricing and marketing strategies designed to control the overall cost of deposits and to maintain a stable deposit mix 
the following table summarizes our total deposits for the years ended december   and summary of deposits in s time deposits interest bearing money market savings total interest bearing deposits noninterest demand official checks total deposits we experienced tremendous growth in core deposits in from customers who prefer dealing with a local  established community bank 
our prime money market account  which has an interest rate tied to the wall street journal prime rate  continues to attract customers and has accumulated million in deposits as of the end of  an increase of over the same period last year 
we also saw excellent growth in our mylifestyle checking  launched in the first quarter of  with an increase of million or during the year from million to million at year end 
this account is an example of how smaller community banks such as valley bank are finding innovative ways to compete against larger competitors in a crowded market 
in addition to a highly competitive i nterest rate paid on this account  customers get free access to any atm nation wide along with many additional rewards

we use an internet based rate posting service for our national market certificates of deposit which are not considered brokered 
this portfolio at december  totaled million  an increase of million from the million reported at december  at december  our total out of market brokered certificates of deposits to total deposits was compared to at december  the following table presents the maturity schedule of certificates of deposit of  or more as of december  maturity schedule of certificates of deposit of  or more in s december  three months or less over three through months over six through months over months total short term borrowings total short term borrowings including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by million from their level of million at december  to a total of million as of december  short term borrowings at december  include two federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb advances in the amount of million and million  and a commercial sweep account program in the amount of million 
the first fhlb advance of million is a fixed rate credit with an interest rate of that matures on may  the second fhlb advance of million is also a fixed rate credit with an interest rate of maturing on december  see the liquidity section for further information on the preceding borrowings 
total short term borrowings including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased by million from their level of million at december  to a total of million as of december  short term borrowings at december  included federal funds purchased and overnight borrowings from the federal reserve bank s discount window of million  federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb borrowings in the amount of million  and a commercial sweep account program in the amount of million 
the commercial sweep program involves balances subject to repurchase agreements which are reported as short term borrowings rather than deposits since they are not fdic insured 
the balance in the program decreased or million from million reported at december  to million at december  the program consists of a demand deposit account from which we invest available balances daily in securities on an overnight basis subject to repurchase 
on the following business day  we repurchase from the customer the securities for an amount equal to the amount of available balances invested in the securities 
interest is calculated daily at the rate applicable for each overnight period  however  it is posted to the customer accounts only once per month 
 we believe the decrease for is the result of the continued economic recession and its impact on our commercial customers  as these customers had less cash to invest throughout the year 
the balance in the program increased or million from million reported at december  to million at december  long term borrowings federal home loan bank advances are relatively cost effective funding sources and provide the company with the flexibility to structure borrowings in a manner that aids in the management of interest rate risk and liquidity 
the increase in advances during the year reflects the funding to support investment growth 
the company had outstanding long term debt with the federal home bank of atlanta in the amount of million as of december   a decrease of million from the million reported as of december  this decrease is made up of one new million fixed rate advance offset by the movement of million in advances from long term to short term borrowings as of december  see footnote of the company s consolidated financial statements for more information on the long term advances 
capital adequacy our capital levels remain strong during this economic downturn 
our capital ratios are above the required regulatory minimums for a well capitalized institution 
tier risk based and total risk based capital ratios were and  well above the regulatory well capitalized capital ratios of and  respectively 
we review the adequacy of our capital on an ongoing basis 
we seek to maintain a capital structure adequate to support anticipated asset growth and serve as a cushion to absorb potential losses and will continue to monitor the bank capital ratios very closely due to the impact our non accrual loans have on retained earnings and capital 
for the periods indicated  we had the following risk based capital and leverage ratios ratio tier total leverage liquidity one of the principal goals of the bank s asset and liability management strategy is to maintain adequate liquidity 
liquidity measures our ability to meet our maturing obligations and existing commitments  to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels  to fund our operations and to provide for customers credit needs 
liquidity represents a financial institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds from alternative funding sources 
liquid assets  which include cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits at other banks and non pledged securities available for sale  increased million or from million at december  to million at december  our funding sources consist of an established federal funds lines with a regional correspondent bank totaling million that had no outstanding balance as of december   one established federal funds line with a third party bank totaling million that had no outstanding balance as of december   an established line with the fhlb that had million outstanding under a total available line of million as of december   and an established line with the federal reserve discount window that ha d no outstanding balance under a total line of million as of december  we believe these arrangements will be renewed at maturity  however the amounts and terms are subject to change 
as of december   we had pledged approximately million of our loan and investment portfolio balances as collateral for borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
as of december   we had pledged approximately million of our loan portfolio balances as collateral for borrowings from the federal reserve discount window as of december   we had pledged approximately million of our loan and investment portfolio balances as collateral for borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
at december   we had pledged approximately million of our loan portfolio balances as collateral for borrowings from the federal reserve discount 
we sell excess funds as overnight federal funds sold to provide an immediate source of liquidity 
we had no federal funds sold at december  and december  in the third quarter of  the company opened an account at the federal reserve bank through our local correspondent bank that pays interest daily on the overnight deposit balance 
we also have an interest bearing account at our regional federal home loan bank in atlanta  georgia with a  minimum balance requirement 
as of december   these two interest bearing deposit accounts totaled million  compared to a balance of  at december  the company maintains a liquidity policy as a means to manage liquidity and the associated risk 
the policy includes a liquidity contingency plan the liquidity plan that is designed as a tool for the company to detect liquidity issues in order to protect depositors  creditors and shareholders 
the liquidity plan includes monitoring various internal and external indicators such as changes in core deposits and changes in the market conditions 
it provides for timely responses to a wide variety of funding scenarios ranging from changes in loan demand to a decline in the company s quarterly earnings to a decline in market price of the company s stock 
the liquidity plan calls for specific responses designed to meet a wide range of liquidity needs bas ed upon assessments that are performed on a recurring basis by the company and its board of directors 
as a result of our management of liquid assets and our ability to generate liquidity through alternative funding sources  we believe we maintain overall liquidity sufficient to meet our depositors requirements and satisfy our customers credit needs 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company and the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as do the prices of goods and services 
management seeks to manage the relat ionship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation
