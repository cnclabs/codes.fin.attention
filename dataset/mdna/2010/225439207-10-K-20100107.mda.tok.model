item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operations summary during and  the company s operations were focused on its two core projects drilling in the mid continent and rocky mountain areas of the us and application of its calliope gas recovery system 
during the past several years  the company has significantly expanded the volume and breadth of its drilling activities by diversifying geographically  scientifically  and in terms of capital  risk and reserve potential 
the company has also implemented a program to increase the volume of its calliope applications by joint venturing with other companies 
these activities are discussed in greater detail below 
the company believes that  in combination  its drilling and calliope projects provide an excellent and possibly unique balance for achieving its goal of adding long lived oil and natural gas reserves and production at reasonable costs and risks 
however  it should be expected that successful results will occur unevenly for both the drilling and calliope projects 
drilling results are dependent on both the timing of drilling and on the drilling success rate 
calliope results are primarily dependent on the timing  volume and quality of calliope installations available to the company 
the company will continue to actively pursue adding reserves through its two core projects in fiscal  and expects these activities to be a reliable source of reserve additions 
however  the timing and extent of such activities can be dependent on many factors which are beyond the company s control  including but not limited to the availability of oil field services such as drilling rigs  production equipment and related services  and access to wells for application of the company s patented gas recovery system on low pressure gas wells 
the prevailing price of oil and natural gas has a significant effect on demand and  thus  the related cost of such services and wells 
results of operations in  oil and gas revenues decreased to  compared to  in the decrease was due to a decrease in oil prices and a decrease in natural gas prices excluding realized derivative gains and losses 
as the oil and gas price volume table on page shows  total gas price realizations  which reflect realized derivative transactions  decreased to per mcf and oil price realizations decreased to per barrel 
the net effect of these price realization changes was to decrease total oil and gas sales realizations by   decrease without derivative gains and losses 
realized derivative gains were  in compared to losses of  in during the same period  the company s oil production increased to  barrels  which offset a reduction in gas production to  mcf resulting in an increase in oil and gas sales of  unrealized derivative losses were  in compared to unrealized gains of  in investment and other income decreased primarily due to the impact of market place declines on the company s investments coupled with a liquidation of investments during in  total costs and expenses  excluding oil and gas property and intangible asset impairment charges  increased to  compared to  in oil and gas production expenses decreased due primarily to decreased field level service costs 
general and administrative expenses increased  to  primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits  board of director fees and expenses  legal fees and a one time  retirement payment to the chief executive officer in lieu of a  per month retirement annuity 
due primarily to low natural gas prices during the first half of  for the fiscal year ended october   the company recorded non cash ceiling test write downs at the end of the first and second quarters  in the aggregate of  the company also recorded intangible asset impairment charges of  in the first quarter of

the company s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization and write downs of oil and gas properties and impairment losses ebitda was  for the year ended october  and  for the prior year 
ebitda is not a gaap measure of operating performance 
the company uses this non gaap performance measure primarily to compare its performance with other companies in the industry that make a similar disclosure 
the company believes that this performance measure may also be useful to investors for the same purpose 
investors should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  or any other measure for determining the company s operating performance that is calculated in accordance with gaap 
in addition  because ebitda is not a gaap measure  it may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
a reconciliation between ebitda and net income is provided in the table below 
table of contents for the year ended october  reconciliation of ebitda net income loss add back deduct interest expense income tax expense benefit depreciation  depletion and amortization expense write down of oil and natural gas properties and impairment of intangible assets ebitda during the company liquidated the majority of its short term investments in professionally managed limited partnerships which were not publicly traded and had less readily determinable market values 
only  of these investments remain at october  these investments are anticipated to be entirely liquidated during early fiscal other short term investments are directly invested in certificates of deposit and mutual funds 
existing working capital and anticipated cash flow are expected to be sufficient to fund operations and capital requirements for at least the next months 
at october   the company had no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements except for the derivative line of credit discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
because earnings are anticipated to be reinvested in operations  cash dividends are not expected to be paid 
the company has no defined benefit plans and no obligations for post retirement employee benefits 
as of october   the company had the following known contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations total impact of current credit markets as the company exited the fourth quarter of fiscal  oil and natural gas prices remained sharply below their record levels 
in addition  problems in the credit markets  steep stock market declines  financial institution failures and government bail outs provide evidence of a weakened united states and global economy 
as a result of the market turmoil and price decreases  oil and gas companies with high debt levels and lack of liquidity have been and will continue to be negatively impacted 
however  the company does not expect to be significantly impacted by these events 
the company has no debt and is in a financially strong position due in large part to its historical policy of conservative balance sheet management 
the company anticipates its cash on hand and operating cash flow will adequately fund planned capital expenditures and other capital uses over the near term  however  the company is not opposed to taking on reasonable debt to finance opportunities which it believes are in the company s best long term interest 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements at october  
table of contents product prices and production refer to item  markets and customers  for discussion of oil and gas prices and marketing 
oil and natural gas sales volume and price realization comparisons for the indicated years ended october are set forth below 
price realizations include realized hedging gains and losses 
price realization oil net wellhead price received per bbl effects of derivative gains losses per bbl net price realization per bbl change natural gas net wellhead price received per mcf effects of derivative gains losses per mcf net price realization per mcf change total sales volumes oil bbl change natural gas mcf change total equivalent production mcfe change effects of realized gains losses on natural gas derivative contracts 
although product prices are key to the company s ability to operate profitably and to budget capital expenditures  they are beyond the company s control and are difficult to predict 
since  the company has periodically hedged the price of a portion of its estimated natural gas production when the potential for significant downward price movement is anticipated 
derivative transactions typically take the form of forward short positions on the nymex futures market  and are closed by purchasing offsetting positions 
the company has elected not to designate its commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
accordingly  such contracts are recorded at fair value on its balance sheet and changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as they occur 
open derivative contracts at october  are indexed to the nymex and are represented by short positions and offsetting long positions 
the company also held basis differential hedges for nymex vs 
panhandle eastern pipeline basis differentials 
actual price realizations in the company s principal areas of operations primarily oklahoma are currently below nymex prices primarily due to basis differentials 
however  regional weather conditions and other economic factors frequently result in substantially higher basis differentials which have historically averaged in the range 
the company has a derivative line of credit with its bank which is available  at the discretion of the company  to meet margin calls 
to date  the company has not used this facility and maintains it only as a precaution related to possible margin calls 
the maximum credit line available is  with interest calculated at the prime rate 
the facility is unsecured and has covenants that require the company to maintain  in cash or short term investments  none of which are required to be maintained at the company s bank  and prohibits funded debt in excess of  the line expires november  
table of contents oil and gas activities capital spending 
capital spending in totaled  consisting primarily of additions to oil and gas properties 
in november   the company purchased all of the calliope gas recovery system patents and all of the remaining third party right  title and interest in the calliope technology 
in addition  the company purchased all of the patents for its new tractor seal fluid lift technology together with all third party right  title and interest in the technology 
the tractor seal technology is currently in the development stage and  except for the patents  the company has not yet provided public disclosure regarding the technology 
the total purchase price was  drilling activities the company owns approximately  gross acres located on the northern shelf of the anadarko basin of oklahoma and north texas where it also owns interests in approximately gross net wells  primarily natural gas wells 
historically  the company s drilling has been focused on this area 
however  in recent years the company has diversified its drilling activities into other regions and has deemphasized drilling for natural gas in favor of drilling for crude oil reserves 
continued drilling on the company s oklahoma and north texas acreage is primarily dependent on natural gas prices  however  because much of the company s acreage is held by production  the timing of drilling is not critical in terms of preserving most of the company s acreage ownership 
in recent years  the company has significantly expanded both the volume and breadth of its drilling activities with new projects in central kansas  north dakota s williston basin  and south texas 
compared to drilling in oklahoma  the north dakota and south texas projects involve higher costs and greater risks but significantly higher per well reserve potential 
in contrast  drilling in central kansas is less expensive than the company s oklahoma drilling projects while still yielding excellent economics 
in central kansas  the company owns interests in approximately  gross acres and  net acres and it is continuing to expand its acreage position 
at october   the company has participated in drilling wells on its acreage  of which have been successfully completed as producers 
the company is continuing to conduct an active drilling program expected to consist of two to three wells per month 
the company owns working interests in the existing prospects ranging from to 
the company s north central kansas drilling activities provide diversification to the company s drilling program geographically and scientifically through the use of d seismic to identify shallow oil prospects 
the acreage is located in prolific oil producing areas where d seismic has proven effective in identifying satellite structures near mature producing fields 
generally higher oil prices have justified using d seismic technology to locate undrilled structures that are very difficult to find with old technology 
drilling targets the lansing kansas city and arbuckle formations at about  feet and  compared to the company s northern anadarko basin  north dakota bakken  and south texas projects  is relatively low cost  low risk  and exclusively targets oil reserves 
in north dakota s bakken oil shale play  the company has assembled approximately  gross  net acres on the fort berthold indian reservation south and west of parshall field 
the acreage consist of approximately drilling locations based on acre spacing units and locations based on  acre spacing units 
the company expects that more than one well will be drilled on many spacing units 
the project targets horizontal drilling for the bakken and three forks shales 
breakthroughs in precision horizontal drilling and multi stage  high pressure fracture stimulations have made the bakken shale a very active resource play which is being actively developed by a significant number of companies  including large independents and majors 
the us geological survey recently estimated that the bakken contains around billion barrels of undiscovered oil 
vertical well depths on the company s acreage are approximately  feet and the horizontal legs are generally expected to range between  and  feet 
drilling is complete on the first bakken horizontal well in which the company owns an interest and the well is currently awaiting completion which has been delayed due to cold weather and is now expected to commence in february the horizontal leg of the well is approximately  feet and will be completed in multiple stages 
credo owns a working interest 
work is currently under way in preparation for drilling two to three additional wells on company acreage 

table of contents the south texas project is d seismic driven with well depths ranging from  to  feet 
the most significant well drilled to date tested the deep wilcox formation on the gemini prospect and resulted in a dry hole 
the  foot well confirmed the seismic interpretation and found porous sand 
however  the sand was water wet and the well was plugged and abandoned 
the company received approximately  of cash for the multiple prospect package and retained an carried interest in the test well 
the prospect package sold consists of two additional deep wilcox prospects located to the north of gemini prospect 
these two prospects are structurally different and unique compared to the gemini prospect 
those prospects are being further evaluated  and if drilled  the company will have the same carried interest in the next well as it did in the gemini prospect test well 
this project is highly dependent on natural gas prices and is currently on hold due to low natural gas prices 
the company owns the patents covering calliope and the exclusive rights to the technology 
the company has been instrumental in developing  testing  refining  and patenting the technology 
calliope efficiently lifts fluids from wellbores using pressure differentials  thus allowing gas previously trapped by fluid build up in the wellbore to flow to the surface 
calliope is distinguished from all other fluid lift technologies because it does not rely on bottom hole pressure and has only one down hole moving part 
calliope is primarily applicable to mature natural gas wells in low pressure  natural gas expansion reservoirs at depths below  feet 
the company has proven that calliope will add to bcf of proved gas reserves to many dead and uneconomic wells 
the company believes there are presently more than  wells that meet its general criteria for calliope candidate wells and thousands more that will meet its general calliope criteria in the future 
the company has proven calliope s economic viability and flexibility over a wide range of applications 
external sources of capital have not been required for the development  refinement or installation of calliope 
the company currently has calliope installed on wells located in oklahoma and texas which include both sandstones and limestones in chester  cotton valley  edwards  hart  hunton  morrow  nodosaria  red fork and springer reservoirs 
at the time calliope was installed  of the wells were dead  nine were uneconomic and two were marginal 
there are non experimental calliope wells 
as a group  those wells were producing a total of thousand cubic feet of gas per day at the time calliope was installed 
since calliope was installed  those wells have produced billion cubic feet of gas and they now have estimated ultimate ths calliope reserves totaling billion cubic feet of gas 
ten of the calliope wells are included in the company s significant properties 
calliope s low per unit finding and production cost have become increasingly attractive as the economics on many drilling projects have deteriorated due to lower product prices 
the company also believes that lower natural gas prices may stimulate divestitures of marginal properties by other companies  including properties that have calliope potential 
on november  the company purchased all of the patents underlying calliope  all of the related third party interests in future installations of the technology and patents covering a new fluid lift technology for shallow wells known as tractor seal for  the company has three primary strategies to monetize its calliope technology 
the preferred strategy is to purchase dead and uneconomic wells from outside parties 
a second strategy involves entering into joint ventures with outside parties that already own calliope candidate wells 
the third strategy is to drill new wells into old depleted fields and then use calliope to recover the stranded gas 
that strategy is highly dependent on natural gas prices and is generally not viable at current natural gas prices 
the company is actively pursuing acquiring wells and joint ventures with other companies 
during fiscal  a joint venture agreement for a pilot project was completed with a large independent and joint venture discussions are underway with several companies  both large and small 
reserves 
refer to item  properties  significant properties  estimated proved oil and gas reserves and future net revenues  for information regarding oil and gas reserves 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  the company believes that its estimates are reasonable and that actual results will not vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the company believes the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties  the accounting for oil and natural gas reserves  and the estimate of its asset retirement obligations 
derivatives 
the company has elected not to designate its commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
accordingly  such contracts are recorded at fair value on its balance sheet and changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as they occur 
oil and gas properties 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for costs related to its oil and natural gas properties 
capitalized costs included in the full cost pool are depleted on an aggregate basis using the units of production method 
depreciation  depletion and amortization is a significant component of oil and natural gas properties 
a change in proved reserves without a corresponding change in capitalized costs will cause the depletion rate to increase or decrease 
both the volume of proved reserves and any estimated future expenditures used for the depletion calculation are based on estimates such as those described under oil and gas reserves below 
the capitalized costs in the full cost pool are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved oil and natural gas reserves discounted at percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties less any associated tax effects 
if such capitalized costs exceed the ceiling  the company will record a write down to the extent of such excess as a non cash charge to earnings  unless the company considered price increases subsequent to the quarterly balance sheet date which may reduce or eliminate a write down 
any such write down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and result in lower depreciation and depletion in future periods 
a write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
changes in oil and natural gas prices have historically had the most significant impact on the company s ceiling test 
in general  the ceiling is lower when prices are lower 
even though oil and natural gas prices can be highly volatile over weeks and even days  the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the test period be used and held constant 
the resulting valuation is a snapshot as of that day and  thus  is generally not indicative of a true fair value that would be placed on the company s reserves by the company or by an independent third party 
therefore  the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on the company s assessment of future prices or costs  but rather are based on prices and costs in effect as of the end the test period 
oil and gas reserves 
the determination of depreciation and depletion expense as well as ceiling test write downs related to the recorded value of the company s oil and natural gas properties are highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves 
oil and natural gas reserves include proved reserves that represent estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their values  including many factors beyond the company s control 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas ultimately recovered and the corresponding lifting costs associated with the recovery of these reserves are often different than the estimated costs 

table of contents estimates of reserve quantities and values for certain properties must be viewed as being subject to significant change as more data about the properties becomes available 
such properties include wells with limited production histories and properties with proved undeveloped or proved non producing reserves 
in addition  the company s patented calliope liquid lift system is generally installed on mature wells 
as such  they contain older down hole equipment that is more subject to failure than new equipment 
the failure of such equipment  particularly casing  can result in complete loss of a well 
historically  performance of the company s wells has not caused significant revisions in its proved reserves 
one measure of the life of the company s proved reserves can be calculated by dividing proved reserves at fiscal year end by production for fiscal year this measure yields an average reserve life of years 
since this measure is an average  by definition  some of the company s properties will have a life shorter than the average and some will have a life longer than the average 
the expected economic lives of the company s properties may vary widely depending on  among other things  the size and quality  natural gas and oil prices  possible curtailments in consumption by purchasers  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
as a result  the company s actual future net cash flows from proved reserves could be materially different from its estimates 
asset retirement obligations 
the fasb authoritative guidance requires that the company estimate the future cost of asset retirement obligations  discount that cost to its present value  and record a corresponding asset and liability in its consolidated balance sheets 
the values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates  including future abandonment costs  inflation  useful life  and cost of capital 
the nature of these estimates requires the company to make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations 
revisions to the estimates may be required based on such things as changes to cost estimates or the timing of future cash outlays 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that provides general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
this topic was previously addressed only in auditing literature 
this guidance is similar to the existing auditing guidance with some exceptions that are not intended to result in significant changes to practice 
entities are now required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated  with such date being the date the financial statements were issued or available to be issued 
this guidance was effective on a prospective basis for interim or annual reporting periods ending after june  accordingly  the company adopted this guidance for the quarter ended july  there was no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations as a result of the adoption 
in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that requires the disclosure of the fair value  together with the carrying amount  of financial instruments  regardless of whether they are recognized at fair value in the statement of financial position  for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements 
this guidance was effective for interim reporting periods ending after june   with earlier adoption permitted for periods ending after march  the company adopted this guidance for the quarter ended july  as this guidance requires only additional disclosures  there was no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations as a result of the adoption 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec adopted revisions to its oil and gas disclosure requirements that are intended to align them with current practices and changes in technology 
among other things  the amendments will replace the single day year end pricing assumption with a twelve month average pricing assumption  permit the disclosure of probable and possible reserves  allow the use of certain technologies to establish reserves  require the disclosure of the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for preparing the reserves estimates or conducting a reserves audit  require the filing of the independent reserve 
table of contents engineers summary report  and permit the disclosure of a reserves sensitivity analysis table to illustrate the impact of different price and or cost assumptions on reserves 
these amendments are effective for registration statements filed on or after january   and for annual reports on form k for fiscal years ending on or after december  fiscal year for the company with early adoption prohibited 
the company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of these amendments will have on the company s financial position  results of operations  and disclosures 
in september  the fasb issued proposed authoritative guidance to align oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures required for accounting and reporting with the new sec reserve disclosure requirements discussed above 
the proposed guidance would be effective for december  reporting on a prospective basis 
comments on this exposure draft were due in october  with final guidance expected to be issued soon 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manages exposure to commodity price fluctuations by periodically hedging a portion of estimated natural gas production through the use of derivatives  typically forward short positions in the nymex futures market 
at october  the company held open derivative contracts representing short sales positions for  mmbtus at nymex basis prices ranging from to and covering the production months of november through december the company also held open derivative contracts representing long positions that offset the short sales 
the long position contracts are at nymex basis prices ranging from to 
the open derivative contracts net to zero volume but will result in hedging gains of  as the contracts expire 
at october  the company also held basis differential hedges on  mmbtus with nymex vs 
panhandle eastern pipeline basis differentials ranging from to and covering the production months of november through december see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations product prices and production for more information on the company s hedging activities
