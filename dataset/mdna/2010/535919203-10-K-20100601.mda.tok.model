in addition  oep reserved the option of buying another of tv guide network under certain circumstances 
the 
table of contents arrangement contains joint control rights  as evidenced in an operating agreement as well as customary transfer restrictions and exit rights 
critical accounting policies the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
as described more fully below  these estimates bear the risk of change due to the inherent uncertainty attached to the estimate 
for example  accounting for films and television programs requires us to estimate future revenue and expense amounts which  due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates  are likely to differ to some extent from actual results 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
accounting for films and television programs 
we capitalize costs of production and acquisition  including financing costs and production overhead  to investment in films and television programs 
these costs for an individual film or television program are amortized and participation and residual costs are accrued to direct operating expenses in the proportion that current year s revenues bear to management s estimates of the ultimate revenue at the beginning of the year expected to be recognized from exploitation  exhibition or sale of such film or television program over a period not to exceed ten years from the date of initial release 
for previously released film or television programs acquired as part of a library  ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed years from the date of acquisition 
the company s management regularly reviews and revises when necessary its ultimate revenue and cost estimates  which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of film costs and participations and residuals and or write down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs of the film or television program to its estimated fair value 
the company s management estimates the ultimate revenue based on experience with similar titles or title genre  the general public appeal of the cast  actual performance when available at the box office or in markets currently being exploited  and other factors such as the quality and acceptance of motion pictures or programs that our competitors release into the marketplace at or near the same time  critical reviews  general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors  many of which we do not control and which may change 
in the normal course of our business  some films and titles are more successful than anticipated and some are less successful 
accordingly  we update our estimates of ultimate revenue and participation costs based upon the actual results achieved or new information as to anticipated revenue performance such as for home entertainment revenues initial orders and demand from retail stores when it becomes available 
an increase in the ultimate revenue will generally result in a lower amortization rate while a decrease in the ultimate revenue will generally result in a higher amortization rate and periodically results in an impairment requiring a write down of the film cost to the title s fair value 
these write downs are included in amortization expense within direct operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the theatrical release of feature films is recognized at the time of exhibition based on our participation in box office receipts 
revenue from the sale of dvds blu ray discs in the retail market  net of an allowance for estimated returns and other allowances  is recognized on the later of receipt by the customer or street date when it is available for sale by the customer 
under revenue sharing arrangements  rental revenue is recognized when we are entitled to receipts and such receipts are determinable 
revenues from television licensing are recognized when the feature film or television program is available to the licensee for telecast 
for television licenses that include separate availability windows during the license period  revenue is allocated over the windows 
revenue from sales to international territories are recognized when access to the feature film or television program has been granted or delivery has occurred  as required under the sales contract  and the right to exploit the feature film or television program has commenced 
for multiple media rights contracts with a fee for a single film or television program where the contract provides for media holdbacks defined as contractual media release restrictions  the fee is allocated to the various media based on our assessment of the relative fair value of the rights to exploit each media and is recognized as each holdback is released 
for multiple title contracts with a fee  the fee is allocated on a title by title basis  based on our assessment of the relative fair value of each title 
distribution revenue from the distribution of tv guide network programming distributors generally pay a per subscriber fee for the right to distribute programming is recognized in the month the services are provided 

table of contents advertising revenue is recognized when the advertising spot is broadcast or displayed online 
advertising revenue is recorded net of agency commissions and discounts 
cash payments received are recorded as deferred revenue until all the conditions of revenue recognition have been met 
long term  non interest bearing receivables are discounted to present value 
reserves 
revenues are recorded net of estimated returns and other allowances 
we estimate reserves for dvd blu ray returns based on previous returns and our estimated expected future returns related to current period sales on a title by title basis in each of the dvd blu ray businesses 
factors affecting actual returns include  among other factors  limited retail shelf space at various times of the year  success of advertising or other sales promotions  and the near term release of competing titles 
we believe that our estimates have been materially accurate in the past  however  due to the judgment involved in establishing reserves  we may have adjustments to our historical estimates in the future 
we estimate provisions for accounts receivable based on historical experience and relevant facts and information regarding the collectability of the accounts receivable 
in performing this evaluation  significant judgments and estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for our larger customers and an analysis of the length of time receivables have been past due 
the financial condition of a given customer and its ability to pay may change over time and could result in an increase or decrease to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which  when the impact of such change is material  is disclosed in our discussion on direct operating expenses elsewhere in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes 
we are subject to federal and state income taxes in the us  and in several foreign jurisdictions 
we record deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
we recognize a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not or a valuation allowance is applied 
because of our historical operating losses  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
when we have a history of profitable operations sufficient to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized  the valuation allowance will be reversed 
however  this assessment of our planned use of our deferred tax assets is an estimate which could change in the future depending upon the generation of taxable income in amounts sufficient to realize our deferred tax assets 
goodwill 
goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment within each fiscal year or between the annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
we perform our annual impairment test as of january in each fiscal year 
we performed our last annual impairment test on our goodwill as of january  no goodwill impairment was identified in any of our reporting units 
determining the fair value of reporting units requires various assumptions and estimates 
the estimates of fair value include consideration of the future projected operating results and cash flows of the reporting unit 
such projections could be different than actual results 
should actual results be significantly less than estimates  the value of our goodwill could be impaired in the future 
subordinated notes 
we account for our subordinated notes by separating for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate on the subordinated notes issuance date when interest cost is recognized 
accordingly  a portion of the proceeds received is recorded as a liability and a portion is recorded as an addition to shareholders equity reflecting the equity component ie  conversion feature 
the difference between the principal amount and the amount recorded as the liability component represents the debt discount 
the carrying amount of the liability is accreted up to the principal amount through the amortization of the discount  using the effective interest method  to interest expense over the expected life of the note 
business acquisitions 
the company accounts for its business acquisitions as a purchase  whereby the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value 
the excess of the purchase price over estimated fair value of the net identifiable assets is allocated to goodwill 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities requires various assumptions and estimates 
these estimates and assumptions are refined with adjustments recorded to goodwill as information is gathered and final appraisals are completed over a one year allocation period 
the changes in these estimates could impact the amount of assets  including goodwill and liabilities  ultimately recorded in our balance sheet and could impact our operating results subsequent to such acquisition 
we believe that our estimates have been materially accurate in the past 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas 
table of contents no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

this statement modifies the gaap hierarchy by establishing only two levels of gaap  authoritative and nonauthoritative accounting literature 
effective july  the fasb accounting standards codification asc  also known collectively as the codification  is considered the single source of authoritative us accounting and reporting standards  except for additional authoritative rules and interpretive releases issued by the sec 
nonauthoritative guidance and literature would include  among other things  fasb concepts statements  american institute of certified public accountants issue papers and technical practice aids and accounting textbooks 
the codification was developed to organize gaap pronouncements by topic so that users can more easily access authoritative accounting guidance 
it is organized by topic  subtopic  section  and paragraph  each of which is identified by a numerical designation 
we adopted the codification prospectively beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  resulting in no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
accounting for noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries 
we adopted new accounting guidance that changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which are recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
this new consolidation method changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders 
we adopted this standard beginning in the first quarter of fiscal see note in the company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended march  
subsequent events 
we adopted new accounting guidance related to the accounting for and disclosure of subsequent events that occur after the balance sheet date 
we adopted this standard beginning in the first quarter of fiscal and have evaluated subsequent events through the date of issuance  resulting in no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
consolidation accounting for variable interest entities 
this new accounting guidance modifies the previous guidance in relation to the identification of controlling financial interests in a vie 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics  among others a the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and b the obligation to absorb losses of the entity  or the right to receive benefits from the entity  that could potentially be significant to the vie 
if an enterprise determines that power is shared among multiple unrelated parties such that no one party has the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance  then no party is the primary beneficiary 
power is shared if each of the parties sharing power are required to consent to the decisions relating to the activities that most significantly impact the vie s performance 
the provisions of this standard will become effective for us beginning in fiscal based upon our review and the current business and ownership structure of tv guide network  we will no longer be required to consolidate tv guide network  effective april  the deconsolidation of tv guide network will result in the reclassification of the asset and liability amounts in each balance sheet caption related to the tv guide network to the investment in equity method investee s account within other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  under the equity method of accounting our share of the revenues and expenses of tv guide network will be recorded net in the equity interest line item in the consolidated statements of operations and we will report interest income for the earnings on our share of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
the adoption of the new accounting standard is not expected to impact the net loss attributable to our shareholders 
we may apply the statement on a retrospective basis with the prior year statements adjusted to reflect the application of the statement as of the beginning of the earliest period presented 
had this new accounting guidance been effective as of march  our consolidated balance sheet would have included a decrease of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  approximately million of net accounts receivable  approximately million of goodwill  approximately million of other assets  approximately million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities  approximately million of other liabilities  approximately million of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock units held by noncontrolling interest and million of noncontrolling interests  with a corresponding net increase to investment in equity method investments  which is classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets
