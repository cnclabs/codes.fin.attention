there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in raising such financing  if it decides to pursue such an alternative 
in addition  we have historically been able to raise capital to continue with our research and development and it is likely that we will need to raise additional funds before we can generate enough revenue to become profitable 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional funds

as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and we incurred net losses of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these losses are principally associated with non cash stock compensation expense  legal defense costs and ongoing research and development of our sonocracking technology  including the development of prototypes  and related marketing activity 
although we expect to continue to incur similar expenses in the future  such expenditures will not include major construction projects until commercialization of our sonocracking technology 
operation and maintenance of the fujairah facility is the responsibility of fujairah oil technology llc fot and sulphco is responsible for contributing its sonocracking units 
the memorandum of association of fujairah oil technology  which defines certain rights of the joint venture partners  calls for profits and losses to be shared  with profits being distributed to the partners  subject to a reserve for legal expenses which may be waived by the partners 
sulphco s share of distributions made by the joint venture to sulphco will also be subject to other costs and expenses incurred directly by sulphco from time to time 
we intend to continue to incur additional expenditures during the next months for the continuous development and testing of sonocracker units 
to date  we have generated no material revenues from our business operations 
we are unable to predict when or if we will be able to generate future revenues from commercial activities or the amounts expected from such activities 
these revenue streams may be generated by us or in conjunction with collaborative partners or third party licensing arrangements  and may include provisions for one time  lump sum payments in addition to ongoing royalty payments or other revenue sharing arrangements 
we presently have no binding commitments for any such revenues 
future revenues and profits from fot are dependent upon the successful implementation of our sonocracking technology 
other possible sources of additional capital include the exercise of the remaining warrants issued to investors in conjunction with previous financing transactions  future collaborative arrangements  licensing arrangements and debt and equity financings 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms when needed 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms when needed  we may not be able to successfully commercialize our technologies  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to unanticipated requirements 
if we are unable to secure such additional financing when needed  we may have to curtail or suspend all or a portion of our business activities 
further  if we issue additional equity securities  our shareholders may experience severe dilution of their ownership percentage

contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations    new accounting pronouncements  significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates new accounting pronouncements and significant accounting policies see note to our financial statements 
critical accounting estimates we make a number of estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements 
these estimates can differ from actual results and have a significant impact on our recorded assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an estimate to be a critical accounting estimate if it requires a high level of subjectivity or judgment and a significant change in the estimate would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the audit committee of our board of directors reviews each critical accounting estimate with our senior management 
further discussion of these accounting policies and estimates is in the notes to our financial statements 
loss contingencies we record loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we consider loss contingency estimates to be critical accounting estimates because they entail significant judgment regarding probabilities and ranges of exposure  and the ultimate outcome of the proceedings is unknown and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
see note to our financial statements for additional information 
stock based compensation in accordance with the stock compensation topic of the fasb accounting standards codification  the company records stock based compensation expense for all share based payment arrangements  including stock options  warrants and restricted stock grants 
the fair value of each option award granted is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option valuation model 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the expected term of options granted to employees is derived utilizing the simplified method which represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the company utilizes the simplified method because it does not have historical exercise data which is sufficient to provide a reasonable basis to estimate the expected term 
the company expects to continue utilizing the simplified method to determine the expected term until such time as it accumulates historical exercise data that will provide a sufficient basis for the company to begin estimating the expected term for option exercises 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve at the time of grant 
deferred tax assets  valuation allowances and tax liabilities we estimate a income taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate  b net deferred tax assets and liabilities based on expected future taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate  c valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and d uncertain income tax positions 
these estimates are considered critical accounting estimates because they require the projection of future operating results which is inherently imprecise and judgments related to the ultimate determination of tax positions by taxing authorities 
also  these estimates depend on assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible 
see note to our financial statements for additional information 
we assess our future ability to use federal  state and foreign net operating loss carry forwards  capital loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets using the more likely than not criteria 
these assessments include an evaluation of our recent history of earnings and losses  future reversals of temporary differences and identification of other sources of future taxable income  including the identification of tax planning strategies in certain situations
