item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item business  item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of saga communications  inc and its subsidiaries contained elsewhere herein 
the following discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis 
corporate general and administrative expenses  interest expense  other income expense  and income tax expense benefit are managed on a consolidated basis and are reflected only in our discussion of consolidated results 
our discussion of the results of operations of our operating segments focuses on their operating income because we manage our operating segments primarily based on their operating income 
we evaluate the operating performance of our markets individually 
for purposes of business segment reporting  we have aligned operations with similar characteristics into two business segments radio and television 
the radio segment includes twenty three markets  which includes all ninety one of our radio stations  eleven analog translators and five radio information networks 
the television segment includes three markets and consists of five television stations and four low power television lptv stations 
general we are a broadcast company primarily engaged in developing and operating radio and television stations 
radio segment our radio segment s primary source of revenue is from the sale of advertising for broadcast on our stations 
depending on the format of a particular radio station  there are a predetermined number of advertisements available to be broadcast each hour 
most advertising contracts are short term and generally run for a few weeks only 
the majority of our revenue is generated from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each radio markets sales staff 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our radio segment s gross revenue was from local advertising 
to generate national advertising sales  we engage independent advertising sales representative firms that specialize in national sales for each of our broadcast markets 
our revenue varies throughout the year 
advertising expenditures  our primary source of revenue  generally have been lowest during the winter months  which include the first quarter of each year 
the downturn in the us economy has had a significant adverse effect on our revenue in the recent economic conditions have negatively affected the demand for advertising and will present a challenge to the revenue and profit growth of our company for as long as the current economic conditions persist 
in we had a considerable increase in revenue due to political advertising 
since was not a major election year  political revenue has significantly declined in we expect a significant increase in political advertising for due to the number of congressional  senatorial  gubernatorial and local elections in most of our markets 
our net operating revenue  station operating expense and operating income varies from market to market based upon the market s rank or size which is based upon population and the available radio advertising revenue in that particular market 
our financial results are dependent on a number of factors  the most significant of which is our ability to generate advertising revenue through rates charged to advertisers 
the rates a station is able to charge are  in large part  based on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers 
in a number of our markets this is measured by periodic reports generated by independent national rating services 
in the remainder of our markets it is measured by the results advertisers obtain through the actual running of an advertising schedule 
advertisers measure these results based on increased demand for their goods or services and or actual revenues generated from such demand 
various factors affect the rate a station can charge  including the general strength of the local and national economies  population growth  ability to provide popular programming  local market competition  target marketing capability of radio compared to other advertising media and signal strength 

table of contents when we acquire and or begin to operate a station or group of stations we generally increase programming and advertising and promotion expenses to increase our share of our target demographic audience 
our strategy sometimes requires levels of spending commensurate with the revenue levels we plan on achieving in two to five years 
during periods of economic downturns  or when the level of advertising spending is flat or down across the industry  this strategy may result in the appearance that our cost of operations are increasing at a faster rate than our growth in revenues  until such time as we achieve our targeted levels of revenue for the acquired station or group of stations 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings is limited in part by the format of a particular radio station 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by constantly managing the number of commercials available for sale and adjusting prices based upon local market conditions and ratings 
while there may be shifts from time to time in the number of advertisements broadcast during a particular time of the day  the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year 
any change in our revenue  with the exception of those instances where stations are acquired or sold  is generally the result of inventory sell out ratios and pricing adjustments  which are made to ensure that the station efficiently utilizes available inventory 
our radio stations employ a variety of programming formats 
we periodically perform market research  including music evaluations  focus groups and strategic vulnerability studies 
because reaching a large and demographically attractive audience is crucial to a station s financial success  we endeavor to develop strong listener loyalty 
our stations also employ audience promotions to further develop and secure a loyal following 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our radio stations helps to insulate us from the effects of changes in musical tastes of the public on any particular format 
the primary operating expenses involved in owning and operating radio stations are employee salaries and commissions  depreciation  programming expenses  and advertising and promotion expenses 
although the slowing global economy has negatively affected advertising revenues for a wide variety of media businesses  radio revenue growth has been declining or stagnant over the last several years  primarily in major markets that are dependent on national advertising 
we believe that this decline in major market radio advertising revenue is the result of a lack of pricing discipline by radio operators and new technologies and media such as the internet  satellite radio  and mp players 
these recent technologies and media are gaining advertising share against radio and other traditional media 
we have begun several initiatives to offset the declines in revenue 
we are continuing to expand our interactive initiative to provide a seamless audio experience across numerous platforms to connect with our listeners where and when they want  and have added online components including streaming our stations over the internet and on demand options 
we are seeing development potential in this area and believe that revenues from our interactive initiatives will continue to increase 
we also continue the rollout of hd radio tm 
hd radio utilizes digital technology that provides improved sound quality over standard analog broadcasts and also allows for the delivery of additional channels of diversified programming or data streams in each radio market 
it is unclear what impact hd radio will have on the industry and our revenue as the availability of hd receivers  particularly in automobiles  is not widely available 
in response to the declining trend in revenue caused by the global economic slowdown  we have continued to evaluate and reduce operating expenses 
during we made reductions in our workforce  implemented a companywide salary decrease  and renegotiated and or eliminated certain contracts 
we are continuing to evaluate every area of our operations for additional savings in expenses 

table of contents a significant decline in the total available radio advertising dollars in our major markets has resulted in a significant decline in our net operating revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding periods of and this decrease in net operating revenue has directly affected the operating income of our radio stations in these markets 
we began to see net operating revenue improvements in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same quarter in  and expect this trend to continue in however  we do not expect any significant improvements in net operating revenue until there are considerable improvements in the us economy 
during the years ended december   and  our bellingham  washington  des moines  iowa  manchester  new hampshire  and milwaukee  wisconsin markets  when combined  represented approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated operating income excluding non cash impairment charge 
an adverse change in any of these radio markets or relative market position in those markets could have a significant impact on our operating results as a whole 
the following tables describe the percentage of our consolidated operating income excluding non cash impairment charge represented by each of these markets percentage of consolidated operating income excluding non cash impairment charge for the years ended december  market bellingham  washington des moines  iowa manchester  new hampshire milwaukee  wisconsin we use certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap to assess our financial performance 
for example  we evaluate the performance of our markets based on station operating income operating income plus corporate general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  impairment of intangible assets  less gain on asset exchange 
station operating income is generally recognized by the broadcasting industry as a measure of performance  is used by analysts who report on the performance of the broadcasting industry and it serves as an indicator of the market value of a group of stations 
in addition  we use it to evaluate individual stations  market level performance  overall operations and as a primary measure for incentive based compensation of executives and other members of management 
station operating income is not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be available to us for debt service requirements  other commitments  reinvestment or other discretionary uses 
station operating income is not a measure of liquidity or of performance in accordance with gaap  and should be viewed as a supplement to  and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on a gaap basis 
during the years ended december   and  the radio stations in our four largest markets when combined  represented approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated station operating income

television segment our television segment s primary source of revenue is from the sale of advertising for broadcast on our stations 
the number of advertisements available for broadcast on our television stations is limited by network affiliation and syndicated programming agreements and  with respect to children s programs  federal regulation 
our television stations local market managers determine the number of advertisements to be broadcast in locally produced programs only  which are primarily news programming and occasionally local sports or information shows 
our net operating revenue  station operating expense and operating income vary from market to market based upon the market s rank or size  which is based upon population  available television advertising revenue in that particular market  and the popularity of programming being broadcast 
our financial results are dependent on a number of factors  the most significant of which is our ability to generate advertising revenue through rates charged to advertisers 
the rates a station is able to charge are  in large part  based on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by periodic reports by independent national rating services 
various factors affect the rate a station can charge  including the general strength of the local and national economies  population growth  ability to provide popular programming through locally produced news  sports and weather and as a result of syndication and network affiliation agreements  local market competition  the ability of television broadcasting to reach a mass appeal market compared to other advertising media  and signal strength including cable satellite coverage  and government regulation and policies 
for the period commencing on january   we engaged in negotiations with cable and satellite providers as to the terms of their carriage of our television stations and the compensation we will receive for granting such carriage rights 
we entered into retransmission consent agreements with certain of these providers and have recognized approximately  in revenue for the year ended december  we expect to recognize approximately  in retransmission revenue in our stations strive to maximize revenue by constantly adjusting prices for our commercial spots based upon local market conditions  advertising demands and ratings 
while there may be shifts from time to time in the number of advertisements broadcast during a particular time of day  the total number of advertisements broadcast on a station generally does not vary significantly from year to year 
any change in our revenue  with the exception of those instances where stations are acquired or sold  is generally the result of pricing adjustments  which are made to ensure that the station efficiently utilizes available inventory 
because audience ratings in the local market are crucial to a station s financial success  we endeavor to develop strong viewer loyalty by providing locally produced news  weather and sports programming 
we believe that this emphasis on the local market provides us with the viewer loyalty we are trying to achieve

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures and contingencies 
we evaluate estimates used in preparation of our financial statements on a continual basis  including estimates related to the following revenue recognition revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers is recognized when commercials are broadcast 
revenue is reported net of advertising agency commissions 
agency commissions  when applicable  are based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing 
all revenue is recognized in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 topic  revenue recognition revised and updated and the accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue recognition 
carrying value of accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  credit history  etc  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past loss history and the length of time the receivables are past due  ranging from for amounts days outstanding to for amounts over days outstanding 
if our evaluations of the collectability of our accounts receivable differ from actual results  additional bad debt expense and allowances may be required 
our historical estimates have been a reliable method to estimate future 
table of contents allowances and our reserves have averaged approximately of our outstanding receivables 
the effect of an increase in our allowance of of our outstanding receivables as of december   from to or from  to  would result in a decrease in net income of  net of taxes for the year ended december  purchase accounting we account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values as of the acquisition date 
the excess of consideration paid over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  asset lives and market multiples  among other items 
broadcast licenses and goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcast licenses and goodwill assets 
as of december   we have recorded approximately  in broadcast licenses  which represents of our total assets at that date  and in goodwill  which was written down in in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must conduct impairment testing and charge to operations an impairment expense only in the periods in which the recorded value of these assets is more than their fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment loss of  for broadcast licenses 
we believe our estimate of the value of our broadcast licenses is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets  and our estimate of the value uses assumptions that incorporate variables based on past experiences and judgments about future operating performance of our stations 
these variables include but are not limited to the forecast growth rate of each radio and television market  including population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures  market share and profit margin of an average station within a market  estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  risk adjusted discount rate  the likely media competition within the market area  and terminal values 
changes in our estimates of the fair value of these assets could result in material future period write downs in the carrying value of our broadcast licenses 
for illustrative purposes only  had the fair values of each of our broadcasting licenses been lower by as of october   the company would have recorded an additional broadcast license impairment of approximately million  had the fair values of each of our broadcasting licenses been lower by as of october   the company would have recorded an additional broadcast license impairment of approximately million  and had the fair value of our broadcasting licenses been lower by as of october   the company would have recorded an additional broadcast license impairment of approximately million 
please refer to note broadcast licenses  goodwill and other intangible assets  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of several key assumptions used in the fair value estimate of our broadcast licenses and goodwill during our fourth quarter annual impairment test 
market capitalization as of december   our total market capitalization was million less than our book value 
we believe this difference can be attributed to the recent volatility of our stock price in the current economic environment and to the control premium that a market participant may pay in the event we were acquired 
in the accompanying notes to the financial statements  please refer to note broadcast licenses  goodwill and other intangible assets  for a discussion of the impact to our equity book value as a result of the fourth quarter impairment loss 
stock based compensation we use a black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock based awards 
under the fair value method  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at grant date requires assumptions and judgments about expected volatility and forfeiture rates  among other factors 
if actual results differ significantly from these assumptions  then stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that previously recorded 

table of contents litigation and contingencies on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our exposure related to litigation and contingencies and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
market risk and risk management policies our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our long term debt arrangements 
if market interest rates averaged more in than they did during  our interest expense would increase  and income before taxes would decrease by  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost  short term investment balances  and interest rate swap agreements  if applicable 
this analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure 
inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on our operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities  which is effective for the company beginning january  the new guidance required revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities  ongoing assessments of control over such entities  and additional disclosures of variable interests 
we are currently evaluating the potential effect of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets  which is effective for the company in the first quarter of the guidance requires additional disclosures for transfers of financial assets and changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
