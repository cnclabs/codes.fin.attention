item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following management discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of stoneridge  inc the company 
this md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
we are an independent designer and manufacturer of highly engineered electrical and electronic components  modules and systems for the medium and heavy duty truck  automotive  agricultural and off highway vehicle markets 
for the year ended december   net sales were million  a decrease of million compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease in our net sales was primarily due to the severe reduction in sales volumes that we experienced in all of our markets in our net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for in  we recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million and a non cash deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million 
there was no goodwill impairment recognized in our results were negatively affected by the decline in the north american and european commercial and north american automotive vehicle markets as well as the economy as a whole 
production volumes in the north american automotive vehicle market declined by during the year ended december  when compared to the prior year 
these automotive market production volume reductions had a negative effect on our north american automotive market net sales of approximately million  primarily within our control devices segment 
net sales to the automotive market outside of north america declined by approximately million between the current and prior years due to volume reductions 
the commercial vehicle market production volumes in europe and north america declined by and  respectively  during the current year when compared to the prior year  which resulted in lower net sales of approximately million  primarily within our electronics segment 
our agricultural net sales also decreased during the current year due to volume reductions 
these volume reductions had a negative effect on our net sales of approximately million  which was primarily within our electronics segment 
in aggregate  production declines had an unfavorable effect on our consolidated net sales of approximately million for the year ended december  in addition  our results were affected by foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign exchange translation adversely affected our net sales by approximately million for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  product pricing had a minimal effect on our current year net sales when compared to our net sales for the year 
our gross margin percentage decreased from for the year ended december  to for the current year  primarily due to the significant reductions in customer production schedules for the markets that we serve 
our selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this million or decrease in sg a  was primarily due to reduced compensation and compensation related expenses incurred during the year ended december  of approximately million as a result of lower headcount and incentive compensation expenses 
these reduced compensation and compensation related expenses are largely due to cost benefits realized in the current year from prior period restructuring initiatives 
in addition  our design and development costs decreased between periods due to customers delaying new product launches in the near term as well as planned reductions in our design activities 
our design and development costs declined by approximately million between the two periods  excluding compensation and compensation related expenses 
in addition to our restructuring initiatives  we reduced discretionary spending in  which has reduced our current year cost structure 
affecting our profitability were restructuring initiatives that began in the fourth quarter of to improve the company s manufacturing efficiency and cost position by ceasing manufacturing operations at our sarasota  florida and mitcheldean  united kingdom locations 
these restructuring initiatives continued throughout and  primarily in the form of headcount reductions to adjust our headcount levels to reflect current market conditions 
the related expenses of million were primarily comprised of one time termination benefits 
the expenses of million were primarily comprised of one time termination benefits  line transfer expenses and contract termination costs 
restructuring expenses that were general and administrative in nature were included in the company s consolidated statements of operations as restructuring charges  while the remaining restructuring related expenses were included in cost of goods sold 
in  our pst eletr nica sa pst joint venture in brazil  which is an electronic system provider focused on security and convenience applications primarily for the vehicle and motorcycle industry also experienced declines in net sales as a result of the world wide economic recession  resulting in equity earnings declining from million for the year ended december  to million in the current year 
however  our dividend payments received from pst increased from million in to million in we currently hold a equity interest in pst 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a significant effect on the results of pst 
on october   we acquired a membership interest in bolton conductive systems  llc bcs for a purchase price of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
results of operations of bcs were included in our consolidated results from the date of acquisition within our electronics reportable segment 
as a result of the acquisition  we have preliminarily allocated the bcs purchase price to net tangible assets acquired  intangible assets  goodwill and noncontrolling interest  of million  million  million and million  respectively as of the acquisition date 
outlook during the second half of the north american automotive vehicle market began to recover  which had a favorable effect on our control devices segment s results 
while we do not expect a full recovery within the domestic automotive vehicle market in  we do expect volumes to increase from levels 
the north american commercial vehicle market improved slightly during the latter part of  however the european commercial vehicle market continued to decline throughout we believe that net sales will increase slightly in due to increased demand for the products we produce 
through our restructuring initiatives initiated in prior years  we have been able to reduce our cost structure 
our fixed overhead costs are lower due to the cessation of manufacturing at our sarasota  florida and mitcheldean united kingdom locations while our selling  general and administrative costs are lower due to an overall reduction in employees 
as sales volumes increase in  we expect our operating margin will benefit from our reduced cost structure 
results of operations we are primarily organized by markets served and products produced 
under this organizational structure  our operations have been aggregated into two reportable segments electronics and control devices 
the electronics reportable segment includes results of operations that design and manufacture electronic instrument clusters  electronic control units  driver information systems and electrical distribution systems  primarily wiring harnesses and connectors for electrical power and signal distribution 
the control devices reportable segment includes results from our operations that design and manufacture electronic and electromechanical switches  control actuation devices and sensors 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for our reportable segments  excluding inter segment sales  for the years ended december  and are summarized in the following table in thousands for the years ended december  decrease decrease electronics control devices total net sales our electronics segment was adversely affected by reduced volume in our served markets by approximately million for the year ended december  when compared to the prior year 
the decrease in net sales for our electronics segment was primarily due to volume declines in our north american and european commercial vehicle production 
commercial vehicle market production volumes in europe and north america declined by and  respectively  during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the reductions in european and north american commercial vehicle production negatively affected net sales in our electronics segment for the year ended december  by approximately million or and million or  respectively 
the balance of the decrease was primarily related to volume declines in the agricultural and automotive vehicle markets of approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  our electronics segment net sales were unfavorably affected by foreign currency fluctuations of approximately million in when compared to our control devices segment was adversely affected by reduced volume in our served markets by approximately million for the year ended december  when compared to the prior year 
the decrease in net sales for our control devices segment was primarily attributable to production volume reductions at our major customers in the north american automotive vehicle market 
production volumes in the north american automotive vehicle market declined by during the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  volume reductions within the automotive market of our control devices segment reduced net sales for the year ended december  by approximately million  or  when compared to the prior year 
in addition  our current year net sales were adversely affected by sales losses during the year ended december  of approximately million 
these sales losses were primarily a result of our products being decontented or removed from certain customer products

consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december  and are presented in the following table in thousands for the years ended december  increase decrease net sales costs and expenses cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative goodwill impairment charge restructuring charges operating loss interest expense  net equity in earnings of investees other expense  net loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss net income attributable to noncontrolling interest net loss attributable to stoneridge  inc and subsidiaries cost of goods sold 
the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was due to the significant decline in volume of our european and north american commercial and automotive vehicle markets net sales during a portion of our cost structure is fixed in nature  such as overhead and depreciation costs 
these fixed costs combined with significantly lower net sales have increased our cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales 
in addition  our cost of goods sold for included approximately million of restructuring charges 
in  there was approximately million of restructuring costs included in cost of goods sold 
our material cost as a percentage of net sales for our electronics segment for and was and  respectively 
this increase is primarily due to significantly lower volume from our military related commercial vehicle products in the current year 
our materials cost as a percentage of sales for the control devices segment increased from for to for our material costs as a percent of sales increased during the current period due to the outsourcing of a stamping operation and inventory related charges 
as a result of outsourcing the stamping operation  the entire cost of the stamping was included in direct material 
prior to outsourcing the stamping operation  the cost was split between direct labor  direct material and overhead 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
design and development expenses included in sg a were million and million for and  respectively 
design and development expenses for our electronics and control devices segments decreased from million and million for to million and million for  respectively 
the decrease in design and development costs for both segments was a result of our customers delaying new product launches in the near term as well as planned reductions in our design activities 
as a result of our product platform launches scheduled for and in the future  we believe that our design and development costs will increase in from our level 
the decrease in sg a costs excluding design and development expenses was due to lower employee related costs of approximately million caused by reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation expenses  company wide 
these current year cost reductions are benefits related to a combination of restructuring initiatives incurred in prior periods and temporary cost control measures  such as wage and benefit freezes and unpaid leaves 
our sg a costs increased as a percentage of net sales because net sales declined faster than we were able to reduce our sg a costs 
goodwill impairment charge 
a goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded during during the fourth quarter of  as a result of the deterioration of the global economy and its effects on the automotive and commercial vehicle markets  we recognized the goodwill impairment charge within our control devices reportable segment 
there were no similar impairment charges taken in restructuring charges 
costs from our restructuring initiatives for decreased compared to costs incurred during related to restructuring initiatives amounted to approximately million and were primarily comprised of one time termination benefits 
restructuring related expenses of million that were general and administrative in nature were included in our consolidated statement of operations as restructuring charges  while the remaining million of restructuring related expenses was included in cost of goods sold 
these restructuring actions were in response to the depressed conditions in the european and north american commercial vehicle markets as well as the north american automotive vehicle market 
restructuring charges for were approximately million and were comprised of one time termination benefits and line transfer expenses related to our initiative to improve the company s manufacturing efficiency and cost position by ceasing manufacturing operations at our control devices segment facility in sarasota  florida and our electronics segment facility in mitcheldean  united kingdom 
restructuring related expenses of million that were general and administrative in nature were included in our consolidated statements of operations as restructuring charges  while the remaining million of restructuring related expenses were included in cost of goods sold 
these initiatives were substantially completed in restructuring charges  general and administrative in nature  recorded by reportable segment during the year ended december  were as follows in thousands electronics control devices total consolidated restructuring charges severance costs contract termination costs total restructuring charges severance costs relate to a reduction in workforce 
contract termination costs represent expenditures associated with long term lease obligations that were cancelled as part of the restructuring initiatives 
restructuring charges  general and administrative in nature  recorded by reportable segment during the year ended december  were as follows in thousands electronics control devices total consolidated restructuring charges severance costs contract termination costs other exit costs total restructuring charges other exit costs include miscellaneous expenditures associated with exiting business activities  such as the transferring of production equipment 
equity in earnings of investees 
the decrease in equity earnings of investees was predominately attributable to the decrease in equity earnings recognized from our pst joint venture 
equity earnings for pst declined from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was caused by a decline in pst s net sales 
income loss before income taxes 
income loss before income taxes is summarized in the following table by reportable segment in thousands for the years ended december  increase increase decrease decrease electronics control devices other corporate activities corporate interest expense  net loss before income taxes the decrease in our profitability in the electronics reportable segment was primarily related to the significant decline in net sales  primarily related to volume declines in when compared to volume reductions reduced our net sales within the electronics segment by approximately million for the year ended december  when compared to the prior year 
the decrease in loss before income taxes in the control devices reportable segment was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of million recognized in additionally  the control devices segment recognized an additional million of restructuring related expenses in as compared to volume reductions reduced our net sales within the control devices segment by approximately million for the year ended december  when compared to the prior year 
the increase in interest expense  net from to was a result of a lower amount of interest income realized in the current year to offset our interest expense 
the decreased interest income is attributable to lower yields on investments during when compared to the decrease in income before income taxes from other corporate activities was primarily due to a decrease in equity earnings from our pst joint venture of million in when compared to this was partially offset by reduced compensation and compensation related costs recognized during when compared to  due to cost reduction initiatives 
compensation and compensation related costs were approximately million lower in than they were in loss before income taxes by geographic location for the years ended december  and are summarized in the following table in thousands for the years ended december  increase increase decrease decrease north america europe and other nm loss before income taxes nm not meaningful north america loss before income taxes includes interest expense of approximately million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
our north american profitability was adversely affected by the million goodwill impairment charge 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge  the decrease in our profitability in north america was primarily attributable to lower commercial and automotive vehicle sales volumes during the year ended december  of approximately million and million  respectively  when compared to the decrease in profitability outside north america was primarily due to lower sales volumes within our european commercial vehicle market of approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  provision benefit for income taxes 
we recognized a provision benefit for income taxes of million  or of our pre tax net loss  and million  or of pre tax net income  for federal  state and foreign income taxes for and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for decreased compared to primarily as a result of the difference in the amount of valuation allowance recorded against our domestic deferred tax assets 
prior to the company had not provided a valuation allowance against its domestic deferred tax assets  therefore the amount of valuation allowance provided in was based on the total domestic deferred tax asset amount 
the amount of valuation allowance provided in is significantly less than as it relates only to the change in domestic deferred tax assets from to due to the impairment of goodwill in  the company is in a cumulative loss position for the period and has provided a valuation allowance offsetting federal  state and certain foreign net deferred tax assets 
additionally  the effective tax rate was negatively affected by non deductible goodwill 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for our reportable segments  excluding inter segment sales  for the years ended december  and are summarized in the following table in thousands for the years ended december  increase increase decrease decrease electronics control devices total net sales the increase in net sales for our electronics segment was primarily due to new business sales of military related products and increased sales volume in contractual price reductions and foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected net sales by approximately million in the decrease in net sales for our control devices segment was primarily attributable to production volume reductions at our major customers in the north american automotive market 
additionally  our net sales were million lower than net sales due to a customer cancelation of our pressure sensor product at our sarasota  florida  facility 
the contract for this business was scheduled to expire in net sales by geographic location for the years ended december  and are summarized in the following table in thousands for the years ended december  increase increase decrease decrease north america europe and other total net sales the increase in north american sales was primarily attributable to new business sales of military related electronics products 
the increase was partially offset by lower sales volume in our north american automotive market 
our decrease in sales outside north america was primarily due to reduced european commercial vehicle sales volume and reduced volume in automotive products 
consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december  and are presented in the following table in thousands for the years ended december  increase decrease net sales costs and expenses cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative gain on sale of property  plant equipment  net goodwill impairment charge restructuring charges operating income loss interest expense  net equity in earnings of investees loss on early extinguishment of debt other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss cost of goods sold 
the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was primarily due to million of restructuring expenses included in cost of goods sold for the negative impact of restructuring expenses was partially offset by a more favorable product mix and new business sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
product development expenses included in sg a were million and million for and  respectively 
the increase was primarily related to development spending in the areas of instrumentation and wiring 
the company intends to reallocate its resources to focus on the design and development of new products rather than primarily focusing on sustaining existing product programs 
the increase in sg a expenses  excluding product development expenses was due primarily to compensation related items in gain on sale of property  plant and equipment  net 
the gain for was primarily a result of selling manufacturing lines which was part of the line transfer initiative at our mitcheldean  united kingdom facility 
the gain for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the sale of non strategic assets including two idle facilities and the company airplane 
goodwill impairment charge 
a goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded during the year ended december  during the fourth quarter  as a result of the deterioration of the global economy and its effects on the automotive and commercial vehicle markets  we were required to perform an additional goodwill impairment test subsequent to our annual october  test 
the result of the december  impairment test was that our goodwill was determined to be significantly impaired and was written off 
the goodwill related to two reporting units in the control devices segment 
restructuring charges 
the increase in restructuring charges that were general and administrative in nature  were primarily the result of the ratable recognition of one time termination benefits that were due to employees and the cancellation of certain contracts upon the closure of our sarasota  florida  and mitcheldean  united kingdom  locations 
additionally  in  we announced additional restructuring initiatives at our canton  massachusetts  orebro  sweden and tallinn  estonia locations 
the majority of this charge resulted in the recognition of one time termination benefits that were due to affected employees 
no fixed asset impairment charges were incurred because the assets were transferred to our other locations for continued production 
restructuring expenses that were general and administrative in nature were included in the company s consolidated statements of operations as restructuring charges  while the remaining restructuring related expenses were included in cost of goods sold 
restructuring charges recorded by reportable segment during the year ended december  were as follows in thousands electronics control devices total consolidated restructuring charges severance costs contract termination costs other exit costs total restructuring charges severance costs relate to a reduction in workforce 
contract termination costs represent expenditures associated with long term lease obligations that were cancelled as part of the restructuring initiatives 
other exit costs include miscellaneous expenditures associated with exiting business activities  such as the transferring of production equipment 
restructuring charges recorded by reportable segment during the year ended december  were as follows in thousands electronics control devices total consolidated restructuring charges severance costs other exit costs total restructuring charges restructuring related expenses  general and administrative in nature  for the year ended december  were primarily severance costs as a result of the ratable recognition of one time termination benefits that were due to employees upon the closure of our sarasota  florida and mitcheldean  united kingdom locations that were announced in equity in earnings of investees 
the increase was predominately attributable to the increase in equity earnings recognized from our pst joint venture 
the increase primarily reflects higher volume for pst s security product lines and favorable exchange rates throughout most of income loss before income taxes 
income loss before income taxes is summarized in the following table by reportable segment in thousands for the years ended december  increase increase decrease decrease electronics control devices nm other corporate activities corporate interest expense income loss before income taxes nm not meaningful the increase in income before income taxes in the electronics segment was related to higher net sales  which increased by million in this was partially offset by increased restructuring related expenses of million in when compared to the decrease in income before income taxes in the control devices reportable segment was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of million recognized in additionally  net sales reduced by million and the segment recognized an additional million of restructuring related expenses in the increase in income before income taxes from other corporate activities was primarily due to an increase in equity earnings from our pst joint venture of million in income loss before income taxes by geographic location for the years ended december  and are summarized in the following table in thousands for the years ended december  decrease decrease north america europe and other income loss before income taxes our north american profitability was adversely affected by the million goodwill impairment charge  which was offset by new business sales of electronic products 
other factors impacting the results were increased restructuring related expenses of million and lower north american automotive production 
the decrease in profitability outside north america was primarily due to increased restructuring related expenses of million and design and development expenses 
the decrease was partially offset by increased european commercial vehicle production during the first half of provision for income taxes 
we recognized a provision for income taxes of million  or of pre tax loss  and million  or of pre tax income  for federal  state and foreign income taxes for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate for was primarily attributable to the recording of a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets 
due to the impairment of goodwill the company was in a cumulative loss position for the period pursuant to the accounting guidance the company was required to record a valuation allowance 
additionally  the effective tax rate was unfavorably affected by the costs incurred to restructure our united kingdom operations 
since we do not believe that the related tax benefit of those losses will be realized  a valuation allowance was recorded against the foreign deferred tax assets associated with those foreign losses 
finally  offsetting the impact of the current year valuation allowances  the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a combination of audit settlements  successful litigation and the expiration of certain statutes of limitation 
we believe that we should ultimately generate sufficient us taxable income during the remaining tax loss and credit carry forward periods in order to realize substantially all of the benefits of the net operating losses and credits before they expire 
liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flows for the years ended december  and in thousands increase decrease cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net change in cash and cash equivalents the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower earnings  partially offset by lower inventory balances at december  when compared to december  in particular  we reduced inventories in because of lower production requirements and the reduction of inventory safety stock resulting from the transfer of production from our sarasota  florida and mitcheldean  united kingdom factories to other stoneridge facilities during the last six months of the decrease in net cash used for investing activities reflects a decrease in cash used for capital projects of approximately million offset by an increase in business acquisitions of million in we acquired a membership interest in bcs during capital expenditures were lower for the year ended december  when compared to the prior year due to our customers delaying new product launches 
we believe that our capital expenditures will increase as the markets that we serve continue to recover 
the decrease in net cash used by financing activities was primarily due to cash used to purchase and retire million in face value of the company s senior notes during there was no similar activity during summary of cash flows for the years ended december  and in thousands increase decrease cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net change in cash and cash equivalents the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower accounts receivable balances in the current year due to lower fourth quarter net sales 
the increase in net cash used for investing activities reflects an increase in cash used for capital projects 
the increase was due in part to the expansion of our lexington facility during in addition  net cash used for investing activities includes the proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets  including two idle facilities and the company airplane 
the increase in net cash used by financing activities was primarily due to cash used to purchase and retire million in par value of the company s senior notes during as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a notional value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the purpose of these investments is to reduce exposure related to our british pound and swedish krona denominated receivables and mexican peso denominated payables 
the estimated fair value of the british pound contract at december  and  per quoted market sources  was approximately thousand and million  respectively 
the estimated fair market value of the mexican peso denominated contracts at december  and  per quoted market sources  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the following table summarizes our future cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments  as of december  in thousands total less than year years years after years debt operating leases employee benefit plans total contractual obligations these future cash outlows for benefit plans were prior to placing our wholly owned subsidiary  stoneridge pollak limited into administration in the united kingdom on february  management will continue to focus on reducing its weighted average cost of capital and believes that cash flows from operations and the availability of funds from our asset based credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our future growth and operating needs 
we expect working capital levels to increase to coincide with higher expected future sales levels 
as outlined in note to our consolidated financial statements  our asset based credit facility  permits borrowing up to a maximum level of million 
this facility provides us with lower borrowing rates and allows us the flexibility to refinance our outstanding debt 
at december   there were no borrowings on this asset based credit facility 
the available borrowing capacity on this credit facility is based on eligible current assets  as defined 
at december  and  the company had borrowing capacity of million and million  respectively  based on eligible current assets 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  and we believe that we will be in compliance with all covenants in on october   bcs entered into a master revolving note the revolver  which permits borrowing up to a maximum level of million 
at december   bcs had approximately million in borrowings outstanding on the revolver  which are included on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of accrued expenses and other 
the revolver expires on october  interest is payable monthly at the prime referenced rate plus a margin 
at december   the interest rate on the revolver was 
the company is a guarantor as it relates to the revolver 
as of december   the company s million senior notes were redeemable at 
given the company s senior notes are redeemable  we may seek to retire the senior notes through a redemption  cash purchases  open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such redemptions  purchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
bcs had an installment note installment note of approximately million and other notes payable for the purchase of various fixed assets fixed asset notes of approximately million as of the acquisition date 
interest on the installment notes is the prime referenced rate plus a margin 
at december   the interest rate on the installment note was 
the installment note calls for monthly installment payments of principal and interest and matures in the weighted average interest rate on the fixed asset notes was at december  at december   the principal amounts due on the installment and fixed asset notes was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company is a guarantor as it relates to the installment note 
as outlined in note  the october  bcs purchase agreement provides that the company may be required to make additional payments to the previous owners of bcs for its membership interest based on bcs achieving financial performance targets as defined by the purchase agreement 
the maximum amount of additional payments to the prior owners of bcs is million per year in  and are contingent upon bcs achieving profitability targets based on earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization in the years  and  respectively 
in addition  the company may be required to make additional payments to bcs of approximately million in and based on bcs achieving annual revenue targets in and  respectively 
the purchase agreement provides the company with the option to purchase the remaining interest in bcs in at a price determined in accordance with the purchase agreement 
if the company does not exercise this option then the minority owners of bcs have the option in to purchase the company s interest in bcs at a price determined in accordance with the purchase agreement or to jointly market bcs for sale 
bcs s results of operations are included in the company s consolidated statement of operations from its date of acquisition 
at december   we had a cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately million  of which million was held domestically and million was held in foreign locations 
none of our cash balance was restricted at december  inflation and international presence given the current economic climate and recent fluctuations in certain commodity prices  we believe that an increase in such items could significantly affect our profitability 
furthermore  by operating internationally  we are affected by foreign currency exchange rates and the economic conditions of certain countries 
based on the current economic conditions in these countries  we believe we are not significantly exposed to adverse exchange rate risk or economic conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates and assumptions used in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies those most important to the financial presentation and those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
revenue recognition and sales commitments 
we recognize revenues from the sale of products  net of actual and estimated returns of products sold based on authorized returns  at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
we often enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s expected production life 
once such agreements are entered into  it is our obligation to fulfill the customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle 
these agreements are subject to renegotiation  which may affect product pricing 
in certain limited instances  we may be committed under existing agreements to supply products to our customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such products 
in such situations  we recognize losses immediately 
there were no such significant instances of this in these agreements generally may also be terminated by our customers at any time 
on an ongoing basis  we receive blanket purchase orders from our customers  which include pricing terms 
purchase orders do not always specify quantities 
we recognize revenue based on the pricing terms included in our purchase orders as our products are shipped to our customers 
we are asked to provide our customers with annual cost reductions as part of certain agreements 
in addition  we have ongoing adjustments to our pricing arrangements with our customers based on the related content  the cost of our products and other commercial factors 
such pricing adjustments are recognized as they are negotiated with our customers 
warranties 
our warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet dates 
this estimate is based on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts  combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims 
to estimate the warranty reserve  we are required to forecast the resolution of existing claims as well as expected future claims on products previously sold 
although we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
our customers are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties  which could negatively impact our exposure to these costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we have concentrations of sales and trade receivable balances with a few key customers 
therefore  it is critical that we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet their financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
additionally  we review historical trends for collectability in determining an estimate for our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic circumstances change substantially  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced by a material amount 
we do not have collateral requirements with our customers 
contingencies 
we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  including product liability claims  commercial or contractual disputes  environmental enforcement actions and other claims that arise in the normal course of business 
we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as ranges of probable losses  by consulting with internal personnel principally involved with such matters and with our outside legal counsel handling such matters 
we have accrued for estimated losses when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment both in assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating that amount of probable loss 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out method for us inventories and by the first in  first out method for non us inventories 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost and the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of the lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the valuation methodologies employed by the company use subjective measures including forward looking financial information and discount rates that directly impact the resulting fair values used to test the company s business units for impairment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our application of this accounting standard  including the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of goodwill 
share based compensation 
the estimate for our share based compensation expense involves a number of assumptions 
we believe each assumption used in the valuation is reasonable because it takes into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations 
we estimate volatility and forfeitures based on historical data  future expectations and the expected term of the share based compensation awards 
the assumptions  however  involve inherent uncertainties 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  share based compensation expense could have varied 
pension benefits 
the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension benefits are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled at december   rate of increase in future compensation levels and mortality rates 
these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the expected long term return on assets is determined as a weighted average of the expected returns for each asset class held by the defined benefit pension plan at the date 
the expected return on bonds has been based on the yield available on similar bonds by currency  issuer and duration at that date 
the expected return on equities is based on an equity risk premium of return above that available on long term government bonds of a similar duration and the same currency as the liabilities 
discount rates for our defined benefit pension plan in the united kingdom are determined using the weighted average long term sterling aa corporate bond 
on december   the yield was approximately deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and regulations 
our deferred tax assets include  among other items  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods 
these deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will begin to expire  if unused  no later than and  respectively 
the company believes that it should ultimately generate sufficient us taxable income during the remaining tax loss and credit carry forward periods in order to realize substantially all of the benefits of the net operating losses and credits before they expire 
statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes asc topic  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all available evidence  it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment  and in making this evaluation  the company considers available positive and negative evidence  including past results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent periods  and our forecast of taxable income for the current year and future years and tax planning strategies 
during the fourth quarter of  the company concluded that it was no longer more likely than not that we would realize our us deferred tax assets 
as a result we provided a full valuation allowance  net of certain future reversing taxable temporary differences  with respect to our us deferred tax assets 
this conclusion did not change for to the extent that realization of a portion or all of the tax assets becomes more likely than not to be realized based on changes in circumstances a reversal of that portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be recorded 
the company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries  which are deemed permanently reinvested

restructuring 
we have recorded restructuring charges in the recent period in connection with improving manufacturing efficiency and cost position by transferring production to other locations 
these charges are recorded when management has committed to a plan and incurred a liability related to the plan 
also in connection with this initiative  we recorded liabilities for severance costs 
no fixed asset impairment charges were incurred because assets are primarily being transferred to our other locations for continued production 
estimates for work force reductions and other costs savings are recorded based upon estimates of the number of positions to be terminated  termination benefits to be provided and other information as necessary 
management evaluates the estimates on a quarterly basis and will adjust the reserve when information indicates that the estimate is above or below the initial estimate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk from time to time  we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily resulting from the effects of changes in interest rates 
our senior notes with a face value of million have a fixed rate 
we currently have no amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility 
at this time  we do not use financial instruments to manage this risk 
commodity price risk given the current economic climate and recent fluctuations in certain commodity costs  we currently are experiencing an increased risk  particularly with respect to the purchase of copper  zinc  resins and certain other commodities 
in the past  we managed this risk through a combination of fixed price agreements  staggered short term contract maturities and commercial negotiations with our suppliers 
in the future if we believe that the terms of a fixed price agreement become beneficial to us  we will enter into another such instrument 
we may also consider pursuing alternative commodities or alternative suppliers to mitigate this risk over a period of time 
the recent increase in certain commodity costs has negatively affected our operating results 
in september  we entered into a fixed price swap contract for million pounds of copper  which lasted through december we continue to monitor the fixed price commodity market and will pursue a contract if we believe that the terms of the contract become beneficial to us 
the purpose of this contract was to reduce our price risk as it relates to copper prices 
foreign currency exchange risk we use derivative financial instruments  including foreign currency forward contracts  to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by reducing the effect of such fluctuations on foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions and other foreign currency exposures 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts that had a notional value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the purpose of these foreign currency contracts is to reduce exposure related to the company s british pound and swedish krona denominated receivables as well as to reduce exposure to future mexican peso denominated purchases 
the estimated fair value of these contracts at december  and  per quoted market sources  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company s foreign currency option contracts expire during we do not expect the effects of this risk to be material in the future based on the current operating and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
a hypothetical pre tax gain loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million or million for the company s british pound and swedish krona denominated receivables  as of december  a hypothetical pre tax gain loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million or million for the company s mexican peso denominated payables as of december  it is important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged 
therefore  a hypothetical pre tax gain or loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted foreign currencies would not significantly affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows
