item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview national healthcare corporation  which we also refer to as nhc or the company  is a leading provider of long term health care services 
at december  we operate or manage long term health care centers with  beds in states and provide other services in two additional states 
these operations are provided by separately funded and maintained subsidiaries 
we provide long term health care services to patients in a variety of settings including long term nursing centers  managed care specialty units  sub acute care units  alzheimer s care units  hospice care  homecare programs  assisted living centers and independent living centers 
in addition  we provide management and accounting services to owners of long term health care centers 
executive summary merger of national healthcare corporation and national health realty  inc  and issuance of nhc convertible preferred stock on october   nhc completed its acquisition of national health realty  inc  nhr as contemplated by the agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement  following the approval of the merger and approval of the issuance of shares of nhc series a convertible preferred stock nhc preferred by the stockholders of nhc 
the acquisition has provided us with ownership of a portfolio of first class health care  retirement and assisted living centers and has enhanced our net cash flows by approximately  in and  in we estimate that we experienced a reduction in and earnings per share of approximately cents and cents per common share basic  respectively  and cents and cents per common share dilut ed  respectively  due to the merger 
we believe  however  that the negative consequence is offset by the accretive effect that the merger has had and is expected to have in the future on nhc s free cash flow 
 revolving credit agreement on october   national healthcare corporation extended its credit agreement the credit agreement with bank of america  na  as lender the lender 
the credit agreement provides for a  revolving credit facility the credit facility  of which up to  may be utilized for letters of credit 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at either  i the eurodollar rate plus or ii the prime rate 
letter of credit fees are equal to times the maximum amount available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit 
commitment fees are payable on the daily unused portion of the credit facility at a rate of basis points per annum 
as of december   the outstanding balance on the credit facility is 
the entire amount of  is available to be drawn for general corporate purposes  including working capital and acquisitions 
we obtained the line of credit to fund further growth strategies as opportunities arise 
earnings to monitor our earnings  we have developed budgets and management reports to monitor labor  census  and the composition of revenues 
inflationary increases in our costs may cause net earnings from patient services to decline 
development and growth we are undertaking to expand our long term care operations while protecting our existing operations and markets 
the following table lists our recent or expected construction and purchase activities 
description beds location placed in service addition columbia  sc first quarter addition garden city  sc first quarter addition franklin  tn january purchase knoxville  tn january addition north augusta  sc june purchase charleston  sc august purchase charleston  sc august new center bluffton  sc january new center mauldin  sc march we expect to begin construction in of a new bed long term care facility in tullahoma  tennessee  a new unit assisted living facility in parklane  south carolina  and a bed addition to our current cool springs  tennessee assisted living facility 
during  we will apply for certificates of need for additional beds in our markets and also evaluate the feasibility of expansion into new markets by building private pay health care centers or by the purchase of existing health care centers 
in  we developed an active hospice program in south carolina independently of our partnership with caris healthcare 
in january  we purchased five hospice locations in south carolina and opened another location in greenville  south carolina 
this brought the total to seven hospice locations in south carolina as of december  accrued risk reserves our accrued professional liability reserves  workers compensation reserves and health insurance reserves totaled  at december  and are a primary area of management focus 
we have set aside restricted cash and marketable securities to fund our professional liability and workers compensation reserves 
as to exposure for professional liability claims  we have developed for our centers performance certification criteria to measure and bring focus to the patient care issues most likely to produce professional liability exposure  including in house acquired pressure ulcers  significant weight loss and numbers of falls 
these programs for certification  which we regularly modify and improve  have produced measurable improvements in reducing these incidents 
our experience is that achieving goals in these patient care areas improves both patient and employee satisfaction 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
our critical accounting policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are as follows revenue recognition third party payors approximately   and of our net operating revenues are derived from medicare  medicaid  and other government programs 
amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the medicare and medicaid intermediaries 
in our opinion  adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these reviews 
any differences between our estimates of settlements and final determinations are reflected in operations in the year finalized 
we have made provisions of approximately  as of december  for other various medicare and medicaid issues for current and prior year cost reports and claims reviews 
consistent with our revenue recognition policies  we will record revenues when the approved requests  including the final cost report audits  are assured 
we recorded revenues of   and  for such settlements in   and  respectively revenue recognition private pay for private pay patients in skilled nursing or assisted living facilities  we bill room and board in advance for the current month with payment being due upon receipt of the statement in the month the services are performed 
charges for ancillary  pharmacy  therapy and other services to private patients are billed in the month following the performance of services  however  all billings are recognized as revenue when the services are performed 
accrued risk reserves we are principally self insured for risks related to employee health insurance  workers compensation and professional and general liability claims 
our accrued risk reserves primarily represent the accrual for self insured risks associated with employee health insurance  workers compensation and professional and general liability claims 
the accrued risk reserves include a liability for reported claims and estimates for incurred but unreported claims 
our policy with respect to a significant portion of our workers compensation and professional and general liability claims is to use an actuary to support the estimates recorded for incurred but unreported claims 
our health insurance reserve is based on our known claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but unreported claims determined by our analysis of historical claims paid 
we reassess our accrued risk reserves on a quarte rly basis 
professional liability remains an area of particular concern to us 
the entire long term care industry has seen a dramatic increase in personal injury wrongful death claims based on alleged negligence by nursing homes and their employees in providing care to residents 
as of december   we and or our managed centers are defendants in such claims inclusive of years through it remains possible that those pending matters plus potential unasserted claims could exceed our reserves  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
it is also possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these reserve estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
we maintain insurance coverage for incidents occurring in all provider locations owned  leased or managed by us 
the coverages include both primary policies and excess policies 
we maintain both primary and excess coverage through our own insurance subsidiary 
settlements  if any  in excess of available insurance policy limits and our own reserves would be expensed by us 
revenue recognition subordination of fees and uncertain collections we provide management services to certain long term care facilities and to others we provide accounting and financial services 
we generally charge to of net revenues for our management services and a predetermined fixed rate per bed for the accounting and financial services 
our policy is to recognize revenues associated with both management services and accounting and financial services on an accrual basis as the services are provided 
however  under the terms of our management contracts  payments for our management services are subject to subordination to other expenditures of the long term care center being managed 
furthermore  for certain of the third parties with whom we have contracted to provide services and which we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that collection i s not reasonably assured  our policy is to recognize income only in the period in which the amounts are realized 
we may receive payment for the unpaid and unrecognized management fees in whole or in part in the future only if cash flows from the operating and investing activities of the centers are sufficient to pay the fees 
there can be no assurance that such future cash flows will occur 
the realization of such previously unrecognized revenue could cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
we agree to subordinate our fees to the other expenses of a managed center because we believe we know how to improve the quality of patient services and finances of a long term care center and because subordinating our fees demonstrates to the owner and employees of the managed center how confident we are of the impact we can have in making the center operations successful 
we may continue to provide services to certain managed centers despite not being fully paid currently so that we may be able to collect unpaid fees in the future from improved operating results and because the incremental savings from discontinuing services to a center may be small compared to the potential benefit 
also  we may benefit from providing other ancillary services to the managed center 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements regarding our relationships with national  nhi and centers previously owned by nhi and the recognition of management fees from long term care centers owned by these parties 
credit losses certain of our accounts receivable from private paying patients and certain of our notes receivable are subject to credit losses 
we have attempted to reserve for expected accounts receivable credit losses based on our past experience with similar accounts receivable and believe our reserves to be adequate 
we continually monitor and evaluate the carrying amount of our notes receivable in accordance with asc topic  receivables previously sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and 
it is possible  however  that the accuracy of our estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of the receivables changes over time 
we continually review and refine our estimation process to make it as reactive to these changes as possible 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accurately estimate credit losses on these balances 
it is possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
potential recognition of deferred income during  we sold the assets of eight long term health care centers to national health corporation national  our administrative general partner at the time of the sale 
the resulting profit of  was deferred 
 of the deferred gain and related deferred income taxes of  was recognized as income in december  with the collection of the  note from national 
 of the deferred gain has been amortized into income on a straight line basis over the year management contract period 
additional deferred income of  will be recognized when the company no longer has an obligation to advance the  working capital loan  which was extended until january  with the extension of the management agreement 
uncertain tax positions nhc continually evaluates for uncertain tax positions 
these uncertain positions may arise where tax laws may allow for alternative interpretations or where the timing of recognition of income is subject to judgment 
we believe we have adequate provisions for our uncertain tax positions including related penalties and interest 
however  because of uncertainty of interpretation by various tax authorities and the possibility that there are issues that have not been recognized by management  we cannot guarantee we have accurately estimated our tax liabilities 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with limited need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles

the overall average census in owned and leased health care centers for was compared to in and approximately   and of our net operating revenues are derived from medicare  medicaid  and other government programs 
as discussed above in the application of critical accounting policies section  amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the medicare and medicaid intermediaries 
see application of critical accounting policies for discussion of the effects that this revenue concentration and the uncertainties related to such revenues have on our revenue recognition policies 
government program financial changes cost containment will continue to be a priority for federal and state governments for health care services  including the types of services we provide 
government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid prescribe  by law  the billing methods and amounts that health care providers may charge and be reimbursed to care for patients covered by these programs 
congress has passed a number of laws that have effected major changes in the medicare and medicaid programs 
the balanced budget act of sought to achieve a balanced federal budget by  among other things  reducing federal spending on medicare and medicaid to various providers 
in february  congress enacted the deficit reduction act  or dra  which reduced net medicare and medicaid spending  and in december  congress passed the tax relief and health care act of  which also affects payments under the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare effective october   our pps rates were decreased by a net of 
there was an inflationary increase of  but there was also a recalibration of the nursing weights resulting in a reduction of 
the net impact of the adjustments was a reduction of to pps rates 
our annual medicare revenues increased  or  over our annual medicare revenues 
the inflation update or market basket increase was in and in overall our average medicare per diem increased in compared to no assurances can be given as to whether congress will increase or decrease reimbursement in the future  the timing of any action or the form of relief  if any  that may be enacted 
medicaid tennessee annual medicaid rate increases were implemented effective july  tennessee medicaid only funded of the normal rate increases for all skilled and intermediate providers 
we estimate the resulting increase in revenue from this payment source was approximately  per quarter 
missouri medicaid funded a global rate increase for all providers of per day effective july  the quarterly effect of these rate increases was approximately  south carolina annual medicaid rate increases were implemented effective october  we estimate the resulting increase in revenue was approximately  per quarter 
overall our average medicaid per diem increased in compared to we face challenges with respect to states medicaid payments  because many currently do not cover the total costs incurred in providing care to those patients 
states will continue to control medicaid expenditures and also look for adequate funding sources  including provider assessments 
the dra includes several provisions designed to reduce medicaid spending 
these provisions include  among others  provisions strengthening the medicaid asset transfer restrictions for persons seeking to qualify for medicaid long term care coverage  which could  due to the timing of the penalty period  increase facilities exposure to uncompensated care 
other provisions could increase state funding for home and community based services  potentially having an impact on funding for nursing facilities 
there is no assurance that the funding for our services will increase or decrea se in the future 
compared to results for compared to include a increase in net operating revenues and a increase in net income before income taxes 
net patient revenues increased  or compared to the same period last year 
medicare  medicaid and private pay per diem rates increased  and  respectively  in compared to additionally  the january  acquisition of five hospice locations in south carolina and the acquisition of a bed skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility and bed assisted living facility located in charleston  south carolina  effective august  added approximately  in net patient revenues

see application of critical accounting policies  revenue recognition subordination of fees and uncertain collections for a discussion of the factors that may cause management fee revenues to fluctuate from period to period

other operating expenses decreased due to favorable professional liability results of approximately  in compared to the prior year

depreciation and amortization increased to  interest costs decreased to costs and expenses in included  from the recovery of notes receivable which had previously been written off   for the recognition of a previously deferred gain  and  on the sale of land

increases in other operating costs are due to the bed additions mentioned above  and inflationary increases 
rent expense in the period declined by approximately  compared to the same period last year because nhc is no longer paying rent to nhr after the october  merger between the two companies 
this decline in rent expense is offset in part due to increased percentage rent to nhi

short term liquidity effective october   we extended the maturity of our  revolving credit agreement to october  at december   we do not have any funds borrowed against the credit agreement 
the entire amount of  is available to be drawn for general corporate purposes  including working capital and acquisitions 
as to short term liquidity commitments  nhc has entered into agreements to complete several construction projects 
at december   we are obligated on construction contracts in the amount of approximately  all of which is expected to require funding within the next twelve months 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements primarily from our cash flows from operating activities 
in addition to cash flows from operations  our current cash on hand of  marketable securities of  and as needed  our borrowing capacity  are expected to be adequate to meet our contractual obligations and to finance our operating requirements and our growth and development plans in the next twelve months 
long term liquidity our  revolving credit agreement matures on october  we currently anticipate renewing the credit agreement at that time 
while we have had no indication from the lender there is any question about renewal  there has been no commitment at this time 
we entered into this loan originally on october   and have renewed the loan twice  with a one year maturity 
at the inception and at each renewal  the lender offered alternative notes with longer maturities  but the company chose a one year maturity because of the terms 
if we have an outstanding balance and are not able to refinance our debt as it matures  we will be required to use our cash and marketable securities to meet our debt obligations 
this will limit our ability to fund future growth opportunities 
our ability to refinance the credit agreement  to meet our long term contractual obligations and to finance our operating requirements  growth and development plans will depend upon our future performance  which will be affected by business  economic  financial and other factors  including potential changes in state and federal government payment rates for healthcare  customer demand  success of our marketing efforts  pressures from competitors  and the state of the economy  including the state of financial and credit markets 
guarantees and contingencies we started paying quarterly dividends in the second quarter of although we intend to declare and pay regular quarterly cash dividends  there can be no assurance that any dividends will be declared  paid or increased in the future 
at december   we have no guaranteed debt obligations 
we have no outstanding letters of credit 
we may or may not in the future elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure in the future 
at december   we did not participate in any such financial investments 
impact of inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years 
however  rates paid under the medicare and medicaid programs do not necessarily reflect all inflationary changes and are subject to cuts unrelated to inflationary costs 
therefore  there can be no assurance that future rate increases will be sufficient to offset future inflation increases in our labor and other health care service costs 
other matters on july   the company received a civil investigative demand from the tennessee attorney general s office  requesting production of documents related to nhc s business relationships with non profit entities
