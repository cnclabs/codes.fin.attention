item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a systems driven purchaser and manager of charged off consumer receivable portfolios and a provider of bankruptcy services to the finance industry 
we acquire receivable portfolios at deep discounts from their face values using our proprietary valuation process that is based on the consumer attributes of the underlying accounts 
based upon the ongoing analysis of these accounts  we employ a dynamic mix of collection strategies to maximize our return on investment 
market overview despite initial signals of an economic recovery  the united states and global economies remain in a recession 
in the us  consumer credit availability is limited and the average annual unemployment rate is at a year high  while credit card charge offs and delinquencies have reached a year high increasing more than from fourth quarter levels to estimated levels of greater than in the fourth quarter of at the same time  home foreclosures have dramatically increased and the housing market continues to experience a significant downturn 
these conditions present us with both opportunities and challenges 
on the opportunities side  the increase in credit card charge offs and delinquencies which contribute to an increase in supply  combined with the challenges some of our competitors are facing in i generating sufficient returns on receivables they purchased in  when prices were high and ii obtaining sufficient capital to fund future purchases which contributes to a decrease in demand have resulted in a significant reduction in the market price for portfolios of charged off receivables 
for example  prices for fresh charge offs receivables that are sold immediately after charge off have declined from of face value in to of face value in we have seen similar pricing declines across all ages of charge offs and the decline is more pronounced in the resale market 
recently  however  pricing has begun to increase slightly from the low levels experienced in most of  although pricing is still favorable when compared to purchases 
additionally  as a result of the significant price decline  some sellers of portfolios have chosen not to sell and  as an alternative to selling their charge offs  have collected on accounts internally or placed accounts with third party collection agencies 
as such  the full impact the price reduction will have on our purchasing volumes is presently unclear 
on the challenges side  increases in unemployment  high foreclosure rates and the difficulties consumers are experiencing in obtaining credit may  for a period of time  negatively impact collections on receivables that we currently own or that we purchase during these challenging economic times 
despite these market conditions  during  most of the collection metrics we track have remained relatively consistent  as compared to for example  payer rates and average payment size  adjusted for the change in single payment payment plan mix  have remained relatively constant 
one change we have noted is that more consumers are settling their debts through payment plans rather than in one time settlements 
payments made over longer periods of time impact our business in two ways first  when payments are extended over longer periods of time rather than received up front  the delay in cash flows could result in a provision for impairment 
this is because discounting a long term payment stream using a pool group s internal rate of return  or irr  rather than discounting a one time settlement payment using the same irr  will result in a lower net present value 
as a result  even if the total amount of cash received through long term payment plans is the same as the cash received through one time settlements  accounting for the stream of payments in the former may result in a provision for impairment 
second  when debts are settled through payment plans  there is a possibility that consumers will not make all of the payments required by those plans 
we refer to consumers who do not make all of their payments as broken payers 
when this happens  we are often successful in getting the consumer back on plan but this is not always the case and  in those instances where we are unable to get the consumer back on plan  we experience a resulting shortfall in collections 
despite the current economic environment  we have not experienced an increase in the broken payer rate in as compared to the same period in please refer to management s discussion and analysis revenue below for a more detailed explanation of the provision for impairment for the year ended december  
table of contents in light of the uncertainties presented by the current economic environment  we believe we are applying conservative assumptions when valuing portfolios for purchase and when establishing our forecasted collections 
additionally  while we believe that consumers who are currently charging off their debt when economic conditions are bad are more likely to recover faster than consumers who charged off their debt historically when economic times were good  we have not factored any such recovery into our forecasts 
when evaluating the overall long term returns of our business  we believe that the benefits resulting from the current lower portfolio pricing will outweigh the negative impacts from the collection shortfalls we may experience from a more distressed consumer 
however  if the lower pricing environment re attracts significant capital to our industry and prices are bid up as a result of increased demand  or if the ability of consumers to repay their debt deteriorates further  our returns would be negatively impacted 
purchases and collections purchases by paper type the following table summarizes the types of charged off consumer receivables portfolios we purchased for the periods presented in thousands year ended december  credit card other during the year ended december   we invested million for portfolios with face values aggregating billion for an average purchase price of of face value 
this is a million increase  or  in the amount invested  compared with the million invested during the year ended december   to acquire portfolios with a face value aggregating billion for an average purchase price of of face value 
during the year ended december   we invested million for portfolios with face values aggregating billion for an average purchase price of of face value 
this is a million increase  or  in the amount invested  compared with the million invested during the year ended december   to acquire portfolios with a face value aggregating billion for an average purchase price of of face value 
average purchase price  as a percentage of face value  varies from period to period depending on  among other things  the quality of the accounts purchased and the length of time from charge off to the time we purchase the portfolios

table of contents comparison of results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue our revenue consists primarily of portfolio revenue and bankruptcy servicing revenue 
portfolio revenue consists of accretion revenue and zero basis revenue 
accretion revenue represents revenue derived from pools quarterly groupings of purchased receivable portfolios with a cost basis that has not been fully amortized 
revenue from pools with a remaining unamortized cost basis is accrued based on each pool s effective interest rate applied to each pool s remaining unamortized cost basis 
the cost basis of each pool is increased by revenue earned and decreased by gross collections and impairments 
the effective interest rate is the internal rate of return derived from the timing and amounts of actual cash received and anticipated future cash flow projections for each pool 
all collections realized after the net book value of a portfolio has been fully recovered  or zero basis portfolios  are recorded as revenue  or zero basis revenue 
we account for our investment in receivable portfolios utilizing the interest method in accordance with the provisions of asc subtopic  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality  or asc servicing fee revenue is revenue primarily associated with bankruptcy servicing fees earned from our ascension subsidiary  a provider of bankruptcy services to the finance industry 
effective january   we revised our unified collection score  or ucs  and behavioral liquidation score  or bls  methodologies by extending our collection forecast from months to months 
ucs is a proprietary forecasting tool that generates portfolio level expectations of liquidation for portfolios that we have owned and serviced for more than six months 
bls forecasts portfolio level expectations based on credit characteristics for portfolios owned and serviced less than six months 
we have observed that receivable portfolios purchased in and prior have consistently experienced cash collections beyond months from the date of purchase 
when we first developed our cash forecasting models in  limited historical collection data was available with which to accurately model projected cash flows beyond months 
during the quarter ended june   we determined there was enough additional collection data accumulated over the previous several years  in addition to improvements in our forecasting tools  allowing us to extend the collection forecast to months 
during the quarter ended march   we determined that there was enough additional collection data to accurately extend the collection forecast in both our ucs and bls models to months 
the increase in the collection forecast from to months was applied  effective january   to each portfolio for which we could accurately forecast through such term and resulted in an increase in the aggregate total estimated remaining collections for the receivable portfolios by million  or  as of march  we did not extend the forecast on telecom portfolios as we do not anticipate significant collections past months on these portfolios 
the extension of the collection forecast is treated as a change in estimate and  in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  accounting changes and error corrections  or asc  is being recognized prospectively in our consolidated financial statements 
this prospective treatment resulted in a reduction in our net impairment provision of million and an increase in revenue of million for the quarter ended march  the impact of the change in estimate resulted in an increase in net income of million and an increase in fully diluted earnings per share of for the quarter ended march

total revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to total revenue of million for the year ended december  portfolio revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to portfolio revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase in portfolio revenue for the year ended december   was primarily the result of additional accretion revenue associated with a higher portfolio balance during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded a net impairment provision of million  compared to a net impairment provision of million in the prior year 
the impairment for the year ended december  was largely due to a shortfall in collections in certain pool groups against our forecast 
while our total collections exceeded our forecast  there is often variability at the pool group level between our actual collections and our forecasts  primarily our through vintage portfolios 
this is the result of several factors  including pressures on the consumer due to a weak economy  changes in internal operating strategy  shifts in consumer payment patterns and the inherent challenge of forecasting collections at the pool group level 
the impairment provision of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to a shortfall in collections in certain pool groups against our forecast  primarily our through vintages 
we believe that this was the result of broadening pressure on our consumers due to a weakening economy as well as to particular challenges we experienced in working certain portfolios 

table of contents until economic conditions improve  we may continue to experience a shortfall in collections against our ucs forecast which  depending on the magnitude of the shortfall and the pool groups that experience such shortfall  may result in future provisions for impairment 
in accordance with asc  an impairment provision to reduce the book value and therefore  maintain a level yield on a pool group s internal rate of return  is only recorded when current information and events indicate that it is probable that an entity will be unable to collect all of its expected future cash flows  or when the timing of such cash flows is delayed 
since we cannot presently determine the future impact of the current economic conditions on our collections  we cannot conclude that further reductions in cash flows are probable or that the timing of cash flows has changed in a manner that would significantly impact any pool groups internal rate of return and  therefore  have not recorded a related additional impairment 
revenue associated with bankruptcy servicing fees earned from ascension was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase in ascension revenue was due to a higher volume of bankruptcy placements in operating expenses total operating expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to total operating expenses of million for the year ended december  operating expenses are explained in more detail as follows salaries and employee benefits total salaries and employee benefits decreased million  or less than one percent  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the slight decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of million related to deferred compensation expense which was fully amortized in  offset by an increase of million in health benefit related expenses 
additionally  total salaries and benefits declined slightly while company headcount increased 
this decline is the result of a shift in our collection workforce from the united states to india and a change in our compensation plan structure in our domestic sites 
stock based compensation expenses stock based compensation increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  this increase was a result of equity awards granted during the year ended december  cost of legal collections the cost of legal collections increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  these costs represent contingent fees paid to our nationwide network of attorneys and costs of litigation 
the increase in the cost of legal collections was primarily the result of an increase in commissions paid on increased collections through our legal channel and an increase in court cost expense 
for the year ended december   we paid commissions of million  or  on legal collections of million  compared to commissions of million  or  on legal collections of million for the year ended december  court costs advanced for the year ended december  amounted to million  compared to million for the year ended december  court costs expensed increased to million  but decreased to as a percent of collections  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of collections  for the year ended december   due to a decrease in our expected court cost recovery rate

see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
in connection with our agreement with contracted attorneys  we advance certain out of pocket court costs 
we capitalize these costs in our consolidated financial statements and provide a reserve and corresponding court cost expense for the costs that we believe will be ultimately uncollectible 
this amount includes changes in our anticipated recovery rate of court costs expensed 
other costs consist of costs related to counter claims and legal network subscription fees 
other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of an increase of million in telephone expenses  an increase of million in skip tracing expenses  an increase of million in direct mail campaign expenses  an increase of million in media related expenses and a net increase in various other operating expenses of million 
collection agency commissions during the year ended december   we incurred million in commissions to third party collection agencies  or  of the related gross collections of million  compared to million in commissions  or  of the related gross collections of million during the year ended december  the increase in commissions was due to the increase in collections through this channel  offset by a lower net commission rate 
the decrease in the net commission rate as a percentage of the related gross collections was primarily due to the mix of accounts placed with the agencies 
commissions  as a percentage of collections through this channel  vary from period to period depending on  among other things  the time from charge off of the accounts placed with an agency 
generally  freshly charged off accounts have a lower commission rate than accounts that have been charged off for a longer period of time 
during the year ended december   we placed more freshly charged off accounts with our agencies as compared to the prior year 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of an increase of million in corporate legal expenses related primarily to our settled jefferson capital arbitration and other ongoing litigation  an increase of million in corporate settlements  an increase of million in building rent related to our india expansion discussed below  and a net increase in other general and administrative expenses of million

during the year ended december   cost per dollar collected decreased by basis points to of gross collections from of gross collections during the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to several factors  including the cost of legal collections increased in total dollars but decreased as a percent of total collections to from and  as a percentage of legal collection  decreased to from 
the dollar increase is primarily due to an increase in collections through this channel 
the decrease in the percentage is primarily due to commissions and court cost expense growing at a rate slower than total collections 
account manager salaries  variable compensation and employee benefits  as a percentage of total collections  decreased to from and  as a percentage of our site collections  decreased to from 
the decrease is primarily due to a shift in our collection workforce from the united states to india and a change in our compensation plan structure in the united states 
other costs not directly attributable to specific channel collections  including non collection salaries and employee benefits  general and administrative expenses  other operating expenses and depreciation and amortization  decreased as a percentage of total collection to from 
this decrease is primarily due to the increased leverage of spreading our non direct collection costs over a larger pool of collections 
the dollar increase is due to several factors including increases in corporate legal expense related primarily to our settled jefferson capital arbitration and other ongoing litigation  an increase in corporate settlements and other increases to support the growth of our company 
the decrease was offset by an increase in collection agency commissions  as a percentage of total collections  to from 
the increase in the percentage of commissions to total collections is due to 
table of contents collection agency commissions growing at a rate faster than total collections  offset by a decline in our commission rate resulting in a decline in cost per dollar collected in this channel from to  due to a change in the mix of accounts placed into this channel  primarily freshly charged off accounts 
freshly charged off accounts have a lower commission rate than accounts that have been charged off for a longer period of time 
india expansion due to the strong performance of our team in india and our ability to reduce our overall site cost to collect through the expansion of our offshore collection efforts  on april   we signed a lease for a new  larger site in india 
this facility  which is located in gurgaon  india  allows us to expand our current collector headcount from approximately to  collector capacity at our previous site was our india team relocated to this new site in september we incurred lease costs at both our previous and new sites from april through october this resulted in incremental lease expense totaling approximately million during that period 
additionally  we have and will continue to incur costs associated with expanding our workforce in india 
our plan is to continue to maintain headcount at current levels in our domestic collection sites and focus our future growth on india 
as we expand headcount in our new  larger india site and migrate more of our collections there  we expect that our overall variable cost to collect will increase and our overall collector productivity will decline 
however  once we are staffed to optimal levels  we expect that this expansion will have a positive long term impact on both our overall cost to collect and our productivity

during the year ended december   we recorded a net impairment provision of million  compared to a net impairment provision of million in the prior year  which included a million impairment on our healthcare receivables  recorded in connection with exiting our healthcare purchasing and collecting activities 
the increase in the impairment provision in  as compared to  was primarily due to a shortfall in collections in certain pool groups against our forecast  primarily our through vintages 
we believe that this was the result of the broadening pressure on our consumers due to a weakening economy as well as to particular challenges we experienced in working certain portfolios 
as a result of the deteriorating economic conditions  as mentioned in the market overview section above  we have seen a shift in payments from consumers from single payment settlements to payment plans 
payments made over longer periods of time impact our business in two ways 
first  when payments are extended over longer periods of time rather than received up front  this delay in cash flows could result in a provision for impairment 
discounting a long term payment stream using our pool group irrs pool group monthly irrs range from to rather than discounting a one time settlement payment using the same irr will result in a lower net present value 
therefore  even if the cash received through long term payment plans is the same as the cash received through one time settlements  accounting for the stream of payments under asc may result in a provision for impairment 
second  when debts are settled through payment plans  there is a possibility that consumers will not make all of the payments required by those plans 
the impact of the broken payers will reduce our overall expected collections  which results in a provision for impairment 
this shift from single payment settlements to payment plans has resulted in a decrease in our actual collections  as compared to our forecasts  in certain pool groups 
since we expect this trend to continue  we expect that there will also be a collection shortfall against our forecasts in certain pool groups 
as such  we made downward adjustments to our forecasted collections in these pool groups  rather than assume that collections would be in line with previously forecasted levels 
these adjustments resulted in greater impairment provisions than we have historically experienced 

table of contents further contributing to the significant increase in our impairment provision  approximately million of the impairment provision in substantially all of which we recorded in the third and fourth quarters  related to the accounts we purchased from jefferson capital 
this represented almost of the impairment in those pool groups which contained jefferson capital accounts

the decrease also resulted from a reduction in severance costs in the current year compared to the prior year  when we recorded a one time severance charge of million in connection with our cost savings initiatives 
the decrease was offset by a million increase in our self insured health benefit plan costs as a result of increased claims 
stock based compensation expenses stock based compensation decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  this decrease was a result of fewer grants and the decreased fair value of stock options granted in recent years  certain grants becoming fully vested during the year ended december  and a reversal of expense due to actual versus estimated forfeiture true ups 
cost of legal collections the cost of legal collections increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  these costs represent contingent fees paid to our nationwide network of attorneys and costs of litigation

the decrease in the percentage of commissions to total collections is primarily due to collection agency collections and commissions growing at a rate slower than total collections 
other costs not directly attributable to specific channel collections  including non collection salaries and employee benefits  general and administrative expenses  other operating expenses and depreciation and amortization  decreased as a percentage of total collections to from 
this decrease is primarily due to the increased leverage of spreading our non direct collection costs over a larger pool of collections 

table of contents the decrease in cost per dollar collected was offset by an increase in the cost of legal collections  as a percent of total collections  to from and  an increase in the cost as a percentage of legal collections  to from 
the increase is primarily due to an increase in gross collections through our legal channel  an increase in upfront court costs expensed associated with our pursuit of legal collections  and an increase in costs related to counter claims  offset by a lower overall commission rate  driven by lower bonus commissions paid to our law firms

certain of these purchase commitments allow us to cancel the commitment with a day notice or a one time cancellation fee 
we do not anticipate canceling any of these commitments at this time and  as a result  have included the entire anticipated future commitment 
we expect to fund forward flow purchases with cash flows from operating activities and or borrowings from our revolving credit facility

critical accounting policies investment in receivable portfolios and related revenue 
commencing january   we began accounting for our investment in receivable portfolios in accordance with the provisions of asc asc addresses accounting for differences between initial estimated cash flows expected to be collected from purchased receivables  or pools  and subsequent changes to those estimated cash flows 
asc limits the revenue that may be accreted  also known as accretable yield  to the excess of our estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over our investment  or cost basis  in the pool 
as permitted by asc  static pools are established on a quarterly basis with accounts purchased during the quarter that have common risk characteristics 
discrete receivable portfolio purchases during a quarter are aggregated into pools based on these common risk characteristics 
once a static pool is established  the portfolios are permanently assigned to the pool 
the discount ie  the difference between the cost of each static pool and the related aggregate contractual receivable balance is not recorded because we expect to collect a relatively small percentage of each static pool s contractual receivable balance 
as a result  receivable portfolios are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition 
all portfolios with common risk characteristics purchased prior to the adoption of asc were aggregated by quarter of purchase 
in compliance with asc  we account for our investments in consumer receivable portfolios  using either the interest method or the cost recovery method 
the interest method applies an effective interest rate  or irr  to the cost basis of the pool  which is to remain level  or unchanged throughout the life of the pool unless there is an increase in subsequent expected cash flows 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally are recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the pool s irr over its remaining life 
subsequent decreases in expected cash flows do not change the irr  but are recognized as an impairment of the cost basis of the pool  and are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as a reduction in revenue  with a corresponding valuation allowance offsetting the investment in receivable portfolios in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
we account for each static pool as a unit for the economic life of the pool similar to one loan for recognition of revenue from receivable portfolios  for collections applied to the cost basis of receivable portfolios and for provision for loss or impairment 
revenue from receivable portfolios is accrued based on each pool s effective interest rate applied to each pool s adjusted cost basis 
the cost basis of each pool is increased by revenue earned and decreased by gross collections and impairments 
if the amount and timing of future cash collections on a pool of receivables are not reasonably estimable  we account for such portfolios as cost recovery portfolios 
the accounts in these portfolios have different risk characteristics than those included in other portfolios acquired during the same quarter  or the necessary information was not available to estimate future cash flows and  accordingly  they were not aggregated with other portfolios 
contingent interest 
prior to may   under the terms of our prior secured financing facility  once we repaid the lender for the notes for each purchased portfolio and collected sufficient amounts to recoup our initial cash investment in each purchased portfolio  we then shared the residual collections  or contingent interest  from the receivable portfolios  net of servicing fees  with the lender 
we made estimates with respect to the timing and amount of collections of future cash flows from these receivable portfolios 
based on these estimates  we recorded a portion of the estimated future profit sharing obligation as contingent interest expense 

table of contents on may   we entered into an agreement with the lender under our prior secured financing facility to eliminate all future contingent interest payments  for a one time payment of million 
subsequent to that date  we are no longer obligated to make any contingent interest payments under the secured financing facility and as a result  no longer record such interest in our statements of income 
deferred revenue 
on august   we acquired substantially all the assets and assumed certain liabilities of ascension 
ascension provides bankruptcy administration services primarily to holders of motor vehicle secured loans  on which the debtor has filed for chapter or bankruptcy protection 
these services are provided subject to the terms of long term contracts 
such contracts generally have initial terms of one or two years and automatically renew annually 
fees for the bankruptcy administration services are charged on a per referred account basis and generally consist of an upfront fee at the time of account referral 
this upfront fee is typically coupled with either an ongoing monthly service fee per referred account or service specific fees based on a predetermined fee schedule 
the servicing deliverable for chapter accounts is focused on the completion of the entire bankruptcy process resulting in the most favorable possible conclusion for the customer 
as a result  revenue is deferred and not recognized until the bankruptcy case is closed dismissal discharge 
due to practical limitations and constraints  a historical average life of seven months is used rather than actual closure dates 
therefore  the total financial consideration less efforts applied to litigation for client contracts without a separate litigation fee schedule is recognized seven months after a referred account is activated 
chapter bankruptcy proceedings  also known as reorganization  are generally designed to restructure an individual s debts and allow them to propose a repayment plan detailing how they are going to pay back their debts over the plan period 
the responsibility of ascension is to ensure that the client s claim is recognized by the court to the maximum benefit of ascension s client  and to monitor and or collect the debtor payments throughout the confirmed bankruptcy plan term 
the average duration period for chapter bankruptcy placements is thirty five months 
given the nature and duration of a chapter proceeding  the monthly servicing deliverable provided relative to a chapter referred account is considered delivered each month and revenue is recognized ratably  including any upfront fees we received over time as the services are provided 
the litigation deliverable is an as incurred event  with revenue recognized based on the historical percentage of accounts litigated over the average duration of an account 
any billings in excess of the ratable revenue will be deferred 
the average duration period for chapter and bankruptcy placements is reviewed periodically for changes 
convertible notes hedge 
in  we issued million of convertible notes due september  concurrent with the sale of the convertible notes  we purchased call options to purchase shares of our common stock and sold warrants to sell shares of our our common stock to the parties to which the convertible notes were issued 
in accordance with asc topic  distinguishing liabilities from equity  we recorded the net call options and warrants as a reduction in additional paid in capital as of december   and will not recognize subsequent changes in fair value of the call options and warrants in our consolidated financial statements 
forward flow asset 
in connection with our acquisition of certain assets from jefferson capital in june  we entered into a forward flow agreement to purchase a minimum of billion in face value of credit card charge offs over the following five years at a fixed price 
we allocated million of the acquisition purchase price to this agreement  which is reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition as forward flow asset 
as part of this forward flow agreement  the seller is obligated to sell a predetermined minimum amount of charged off credit card accounts to us 
the forward flow agreement contains penalty provisions if the seller fails to meet such minimum requirements 
any monies received pursuant to such penalty provisions would be applied to the carrying balance of the forward flow asset 
in july  we ceased forward flow purchases from jefferson capital due to an alleged breach by jefferson capital and its parent  compucredit corporation  of certain agreements 
in september  we settled our dispute with jefferson capital and compucredit 
under the terms of the settlement  we purchased a large portfolio of charged off credit card account balances on commercially reasonable terms and agreed to resume balance transfers to jefferson capital 

table of contents prior to our cessation of forward flow purchases from jefferson capital and compucredit  we allocated a portion of the forward flow asset to the cost basis of receivable portfolio purchases under the forward flow agreement as purchases are made 
as a result of the settlement as discussed above  the remaining forward flow asset of million was fully allocated to the purchase price of the large portfolio we acquired as part of the settlement 
following the settlement  we will have no further forward flow purchase obligations with jefferson capital and compucredit 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  for more information on our settled dispute with jefferson capital and compucredit 
deferred court costs 
we contract with a nationwide network of attorneys that specialize in collection matters 
we generally refer charged off accounts to our contracted attorneys when we believe the related debtor has sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness and has  to date  been unwilling to pay 
in connection with our agreements with our contracted attorneys  we advance certain out of pocket court costs  or deferred court costs 
we capitalize these costs in the consolidated financial statements and provide a reserve for those costs that we believe will ultimately be uncollectible 
we determine the reserve based on our analysis of court costs that have been advanced and recovered  or that we anticipate recovering 
deferred court costs not recovered within three years of placement are fully written off 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to interest rates and foreign currency 
our interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange contracts qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the provisions of asc topic derivatives and hedging  or asc asc requires that qualifying derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives  if any  is recognized in earnings in the period of change 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivative instruments 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted the provisions within asc topic compensation stock compensation 
under this guidance  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based awards 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our stock based compensation 
income taxes 
we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc when we prepare the consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we record a corresponding tax expense in our statements of income 
when we reduce our valuation allowance in an accounting period  we record a corresponding tax benefit in our statements of income 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
on january   we adopted the provisions within asc related to uncertainty in income taxes 
this guidance establishes recognition and measurement thresholds that must be met before a tax benefit can be recognized in the financial statements 
additionally  these provisions provide guidance on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
upon adoption  we did not have any uncertain tax positions and as a result  we were not required to record any cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of the provisions for uncertainty in income taxes 

table of contents use of estimates 
we have made significant estimates with respect to the rate of return established to recognize accretion revenue on our receivable portfolios and with respect to the provision for impairment of receivable portfolios 
in connection with these estimates  we have made significant estimates with respect to the timing and amount of collections of future cash flows from receivable portfolios owned 
significant estimates have also been made with respect to ascension s service revenue  the realizability of our net deferred court costs  forward flow asset  other assets  intangible assets  net deferred tax assets and tax reserve  stock based compensation  and the potential liabilities with respect to our health benefits plans 
changes in accounting estimate effective january   we revised our ucs and bls methodologies by extending our collection forecast from months to months 
ucs is a proprietary forecasting tool that generates portfolio level expectations of liquidation for portfolios that we have owned and serviced for more than six months 
bls forecasts portfolio level expectations based on credit characteristics for portfolios owned and serviced less than six months 
we have observed that receivable portfolios purchased in and prior have consistently experienced cash collections beyond months from the date of purchase 
when we first developed our cash forecasting models in  limited historical collection data was available with which to accurately model projected cash flows beyond months 
during the quarter ended june   we determined there was enough additional collection data accumulated over the previous several years  in addition to improvements in our forecasting tools  allowing us to extend the collection forecast to months 
during the quarter ended march   we determined that there were enough additional collection data to accurately extend the collection forecast in both our ucs and bls models to months 
the increase in the collection forecast from to months was applied effective january   to each portfolio for which we could accurately forecast through such term and resulted in an increase in the aggregate total estimated remaining collections for the receivable portfolios by million  or  as of march  we did not extend the forecast on telecom portfolios as we do not anticipate significant collections past months on these portfolios 
the extension of the collection forecast was treated as a change in estimate and  in accordance with asc was recognized prospectively in our consolidated financial statements  effective january  in the quarter ended march   this prospective treatment resulted in a reduction in our net impairment provision of million and an increase in revenue of million 
the impact of the change in estimate resulted in an increase in net income of million and an increase in fully diluted earnings per share of  which we recorded in the quarter ended march  new accounting pronouncements on july   the fasb officially launched the fasb accounting standards codification  which has become the single official source of authoritative  nongovernmental us generally accepted accounting principles  in addition to guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings 
as of december   we had total borrowings of million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  of which million was subject to variable interest rates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of debt 
changes in short term interest rates also affect our earnings as a result of our borrowings under variable rate borrowing agreements 
if the market interest rates for our variable rate agreements increase at an average of  interest expense would increase  and income before income taxes would decrease by approximately million  on an annualized basis  based on the amount of related outstanding borrowings subject to variable interest rates as of december   of million 
conversely  if market interest rates decreased an average of  our interest expense would decrease  thereby increasing income before income taxes by approximately million  on an annualized basis  based on borrowings subject to variable interest rates as of december
