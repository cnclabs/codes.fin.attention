item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were established to continue to operate and expand the retail property business of our predecessor 
we commenced our operations in april our assets are held by and all operations are conducted through  directly or indirectly  the operating partnership  of which we are the sole general partner and held a interest as of december  we are operating so as to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of agree realty corporation  including the respective notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this form k 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update topic generally accepted accounting principles amendments based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles asu  the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas 
asu  or the fasb accounting standards codification codification  will become the source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
on the effective date of asu  the codification will supersede all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non grandfathered non sec accounting literature not included in the codification will become non authoritative 
asu is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both significant to the overall presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
for example  significant estimates and assumptions have been made with respect to revenue recognition  capitalization of costs related to real estate investments  potential impairment of real estate investments  operating cost reimbursements  and taxable income 
minimum rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from tenants 
certain leases provide for additional percentage rents based on tenants sales volumes 
these percentage rents are recognized when determinable by us 
in addition  leases for certain tenants contain rent escalations and or free rent during the first several months of the lease term  however  such amounts are not material 
real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
all costs related to planning  development and construction of buildings prior to the date they become operational  including interest and real estate taxes during the construction period  are capitalized for financial reporting purposes and recorded as property under development until construction has been completed 
the viability of all projects under construction or development are regularly evaluated under applicable accounting requirements  including requirements relating to abandonment of assets or changes in use 
to the extent a project  or individual components of the project  are no longer considered to have value  the related capitalized costs are charged against operations 
subsequent to completion of construction  expenditures for property maintenance are charged to operations as incurred  while significant renovations are capitalized 
depreciation of the buildings is recorded on the straight line method using an estimated useful life of forty years 
we evaluate real estate for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets 
when any such impairment exists  the related assets will be written down to fair value and such excess carrying value is charged to income 
the expected cash flows of a project are dependent on estimates and other factors subject to change  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  increases in operating costs  bankruptcy and or other changes in the condition of third parties  including tenants  expected holding period  and availability of credit 
these factors could cause our expected future cash flows from a project to change  and  as a result  an impairment could be considered to have occurred 
substantially all of our leases contain provisions requiring tenants to pay as additional rent a proportionate share of operating expenses operating cost reimbursements such as real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  insurance  etc 
the related revenue from tenant billings is recognized in the same period the expense is recorded 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code  commencing with our tax year 
as a result  we are not subject to federal income taxes to the extent that we distribute annually at lease of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and satisfy certain other requirements defined in the internal revenue code 
we established trs entities pursuant to the provisions of the reit modernization act 
our trs entities are able to engage in activities resulting in income that previously would have been disqualified from being eligible reit income under the federal income tax regulations 
as a result  certain activities of our company which occur within our trs entities are subject to federal and state income taxes

the transaction resulted in a gain of  net of deferred income taxes of  we established a trs to facilitate this transaction 
we elected to defer the recognition of the gain from the transaction for income tax purposes by making an election under section of the internal revenue code 
there were no gains from property sales in our net income decreased  or  to  in  from  in as a result of the foregoing factors 
liquidity and capital resources our principal demands for liquidity are operations  distributions to our stockholders  debt repayment  development of new properties  redevelopment of existing properties and future property acquisitions 
we intend to meet our short term liquidity requirements  including capital expenditures related to the leasing and improvement of the properties  through cash flow provided by operations and the line of credit and the credit facility as defined below 
we believe that adequate cash flow will be available to fund our operations and pay dividends in accordance with reit requirements for at least the next months 
we may obtain additional funds for future development or acquisitions through other borrowings or the issuance of additional shares of common stock  although current market conditions have severely limited the availability of new sources of financing and capital  which will likely have an impact on our ability to obtain construction financing for planned new development projects in the near term 
we believe that these financing sources will enable us to generate funds sufficient to meet both our short term and long term capital needs 
we intend to maintain a ratio of total indebtedness including construction or acquisition financing to market capitalization of or less 
nevertheless  we may operate with debt levels which are in excess of of market capitalization for extended periods of time 
at december   our ratio of indebtedness to market capitalization was approximately 
this ratio decreased from as of december  as a result of an increase in the market value of our common stock 
during the quarter ended december   we declared a quarterly dividend of 
per share 
the cash dividend was paid on january  to holders of record on december  our cash flows from operations increased  to  in  compared to  in cash used in investing activities decreased  to  in  compared to  in cash used in financing activities increased  to  in  compared to  in our cash and cash equivalents increased by  to  as of december  as a result of the foregoing factors 
as of december   we had total mortgage indebtedness of  of this total mortgage indebtedness   is fixed rate  self amortizing debt with a weighted average interest rate of and the remaining mortgage debt of  has a maturity date of july   can be extended at our option for two additional years and bears interest at basis points over libor or as of december  
the proceeds from this mortgage loan were used to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility as defined below 
in january  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that will fix the interest rate during the initial term of the mortgage at 
in addition  the operating partnership has in place a million credit facility the credit facility with bank of america  as the agent  which is guaranteed by our company 
the credit facility matures in november advances under the credit facility bear interest within a range of one month to month libor plus basis points to basis points or the lender s prime rate  at our option  based on certain factors such as the ratio of our indebtedness to the capital value of our properties 
the credit facility generally is used to fund property acquisitions and development activities 
as of february    was outstanding under the credit facility bearing a weighted average interest rate of 
we also have in place a million line of credit the line of credit  which matures in november the line of credit bears interest at the lender s prime rate less basis points or basis points in excess of the one month to month libor rate  at our option 
the purpose of the line of credit is to generally provide working capital and fund land options and start up costs associated with new projects 
as of february    was outstanding under the line of credit bearing a weighted average interest rate of the following table outlines our contractual obligations in thousands as of december  total yr yrs yrs over yrs mortgages payable notes payable land lease obligations other long term liabilities estimated interest payments on mortgages and notes payable total we have three development projects under construction that will add an additional  square feet to our portfolio 
the projects are expected to be completed during the third quarter of additional funding required to complete the projects is estimated to be  which is not reflected in the table above  and is expected to be provided by the credit facility 
we plan to begin construction of additional pre leased developments and may acquire additional properties  which will initially be financed by the credit facility and line of credit 
we will periodically refinance short term construction and acquisition financing with long term debt  medium term debt and or equity 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as structured finance or special purpose entities  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditure or capital resources 
inflation our leases generally contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on net income 
these provisions include clauses enabling us to pass through to our tenants certain operating costs  including real estate taxes  common area maintenance  utilities and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to cost increases and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
certain of our leases contain clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the term of the leases 
in addition  expiring tenant leases permit us to seek increased rents upon re lease at market rates if rents are below the then existing market rates 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit to mean net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
management uses ffo as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using gaap net income by itself as the primary measure of our operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
further  while we adhere to the nareit definition of ffo  our presentation of ffo is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits due to the fact that not all reits use the same definition 
the following table provides a reconciliation of ffo and net income for the years ended december   and year ended december  net income depreciation of real estate assets amortization of leasing costs gain on sale of assets funds from operations weighted average shares and op units outstanding basic diluted item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowing activities 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and our future financing requirements 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal payments in thousands and the weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt  by year of expected maturity  to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
thereafter total fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate mortgage average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate the fair value in thousands is estimated at   and  for fixed rate mortgages  variable rate mortgage and other variable rate debt  respectively  as of december  the table above incorporates those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions  which could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge interest rates on million in variable rate borrowings outstanding 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement  we will receive from the counterparty interest on the notional amount based on plus one month libor and will pay to the counterparty a fixed rate of 
this swap effectively converted million of variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
as of december   the interest rate swap was valued at  we do not use derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and we did not have any other derivative instruments or hedging activities as of december  as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates on the portion of our debt bearing interest at variable rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately
