item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section includes a discussion of our operations for the three fiscal years ended august  the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto in part ii  item of this report and the selected financial data contained in part ii  item of this report 
business we operate in three reporting segments mrb  apb and smb that collectively provide an end of life cycle solution for a variety of products through our integrated businesses 
we use operating income loss to measure our segment performance 
corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated expense for management and administrative services that benefit all three reporting segments 
as a result of this unallocated expense  the operating income loss of each reporting segment does not reflect the operating income loss the reporting segment would have as a stand alone business 
for further information regarding our reporting segments  including financial information about geographic areas  see note segment information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
mrb buys  collects  processes  recycles  sells and brokers ferrous scrap metal containing iron to foreign and domestic steel producers  including smb  and nonferrous scrap metal not containing iron to both foreign and domestic markets 
mrb processes mixed and large pieces of scrap metal into smaller pieces by sorting  shearing  shredding and torching  resulting in scrap metal pieces of a size  density and purity required by customers to meet their production needs 
apb procures used and salvaged vehicles and sells serviceable used auto parts from these vehicles through its self service auto parts stores 
the remaining portions of the vehicles  primarily autobodies  cores and nonferrous materials  are sold to metal recyclers  including mrb where geographically feasible 
smb operates a steel mini mill that produces a wide range of finished steel products 
smb purchases substantially all of its recycled metal from mrb at rates that approximate export market prices for shipments from the west coast of the us and uses its mini mill near portland  oregon to melt recycled metal and other raw materials to produce finished steel products 
smb also maintains mill depots in central and southern california 
our results of operations depend in large part on the demand and prices for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and steel products in the western us 
our deep water port facilities on both the east and west coasts of the us in everett  massachusetts  oakland  california  portland  oregon  tacoma  washington  and providence  rhode island and access to public deep water port facilities in kapolei  hawaii and salinas  puerto rico allow us to meet the demand for recycled metal by steel manufacturers located in europe  asia  central america and africa 
our processing facilities in the southeastern us also provide access to the automobile and steel manufacturing industries in that region 
key economic factors and trends affecting the industries in which we operate our financial results largely depend on supply of raw materials in the us and demand for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and for steel products in the western us 
fluctuating or volatile supply and demand conditions affect market prices for and volumes of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal in global markets and for steel products in the western us and can have a significant impact on the results of operations for all three reporting segments 
in fiscal  we continued to experience the effects of the global economic crisis 
the us economy began to show some signs of a gradual recovery through increased us steel mill utilization over the prior year and slightly improved availability of raw materials 
better economic conditions in overseas markets  particularly in asia  led to a continuing strong demand for exports of ferrous and nonferrous recycled materials 
however  the global economy was schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents still hampered by other factors  including the european sovereign debt crisis and the tightening of credit availability in china 
although our overall financial performance benefited from the gradually improving global economy  the still uncertain nature of the recovery and resulting market volatility led to variable quarterly results throughout fiscal strategic factors as we continue to closely monitor the economic situation  we remain focused on our core strategies which we believe will meet our business objectives use of our seven deep water ports to access customers directly around the world and to meet demand wherever it is greatest  growth through acquisitions in existing and new geographic regions that create value and generate returns in excess of our cost of capital  continued investment in and benefit from technologies and process improvements which increase the separation and recovery of recycled materials from our shredding process  and continued improvement in our productivity  focus on cost containment and optimization of the spreads between our selling prices and the cost of acquiring materials 
in fiscal  we acquired from lkq corporation four self service used auto parts stores which are located near mrb s export facility in portland  oregon and two self service used auto parts stores which increased our presence in the dallas fort worth metroplex 
we also acquired a metals recycler in montana to provide an additional source of scrap metal for our tacoma  washington export facility and sold our full service used auto parts operation to lkq corporation 
executive overview of financial results in fiscal  our operating results benefited from increased average selling prices due to continuing strong demand for scrap and recycled metal products and saw us return to profitability  with revenues growing by million to billion and net income attributable to ssi of million compared to a loss of million in fiscal diluted net income attributable to ssi was per share for fiscal compared to a net loss of per share in fiscal logo logo the following items summarize our consolidated financial performance for fiscal revenues of billion  compared to billion in the prior year  operating income of million  compared to operating loss of million in the prior year  net income from continuing operations attributable to ssi of million  or per share diluted  compared to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to ssi of million  or per share diluted  in the prior year  and net income attributable to ssi of million  or per share diluted  compared to a net loss attributable to ssi of million  or per share diluted  in the prior year

in fiscal  our mrb segment generated revenues of billion  a million increase from fiscal  which included a million  or  increase in ferrous revenues and a million  or  increase in nonferrous revenues 
the increase in ferrous revenues was primarily driven by a increase in average net selling price  resulting from strong demand in asian markets and to a lesser extent improved domestic markets for scrap metal 
the increase in nonferrous revenues was driven by a increase in the average net selling price and a increase in pounds sold due to higher demand and increased availability of raw materials 
mrb had operating income of million compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  our apb segment set records for self service revenues and operating income with revenues of million and operating income of million 
the million increase in revenues over the prior year was driven by a million increase in scrap vehicle revenue and a million increase in core revenue primarily due to higher sales volumes and selling prices  and a million increase in parts revenues 
apb had operating income of million compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  our smb segment generated revenues of million  a million increase from fiscal the increase over prior year reflected an increase in sales volumes for finished steel products of thousand tons  or  to thousand tons in fiscal however  the average net selling price decreased per ton  or  to per ton in fiscal the increases in sales volume reflected improved  but still weak  demand for finished steel products in western north america 
smb had an operating loss of million compared to million in fiscal share repurchases during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of class a common stock  or approximately of the total class a and class b shares outstanding  at a total cost of million under the authority granted by our board of directors

corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated expenses for services that benefit all three business segments 
as a consequence of this unallocated expense  the operating income of each segment does not reflect the operating income the segment would have as a stand alone business 
the joint ventures sell recycled ferrous metal to mrb and then subsequentely to smb at rates per ton that approximate west coast export market prices 
consequently  these intercompany revenues produce intercompany operating income loss  which is not recognized until the finished products are sold to third parties  therefore  intercompany profit is eliminated while the products remain in inventory

table of contents revenues fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated revenues for fiscal increased million  or  to billion 
revenues in fiscal increased for all reporting segments primarily due to continuing strong worldwide demand for scrap and recycled metal  which led to higher average net selling prices and sales volumes  and to a lesser extent increased western us demand for finished steel products 
fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated revenues for fiscal decreased billion  or  to billion 
revenues in fiscal decreased for all reporting segments primarily due to the worldwide economic crisis which reduced demand for scrap and recycled metal and finished steel products throughout the period 
this reduced demand resulted in lower scrap and recycled metal and finished steel sales volumes and lower average selling prices 
operating income loss fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated operating income was million for fiscal compared to a consolidated operating loss of million for fiscal as a percentage of consolidated revenues  consolidated operating income increased by percentage points for fiscal compared to fiscal this improvement in consolidated operating income was primarily due to higher average net selling prices  which increased more than the average cost of raw materials  and increased availability of raw materials  which widened operating margins 
the improvement in consolidated operating income also benefited from a decrease in consolidated selling  general and administrative sg a expense of million  to million for fiscal the decrease included million in higher bad debt expense recognized in the prior year  million in current year benefits recognized from legal settlements  million in environmental and legal cost reimbursements  including million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and million in reduced professional service fees 
these decreases were partially offset by an million increase in incentive compensation due to improvements in financial performance and the reinstatement of employer contributions to our defined contribution plans effective april  and by million of increased expense related to the amortization of intangibles 
fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated operating loss was million for fiscal compared to a consolidated operating income of million for fiscal as a percentage of consolidated revenues  consolidated operating income decreased by percentage points for fiscal compared to fiscal weaker year over year demand and the impact of declines in selling prices  which outpaced the decline in purchase prices  resulted in the reduction in operating income that included a non cash net realizable value nrv inventory write down of million in fiscal this decrease in consolidated operating income loss was partially offset by a million release of environmental reserves and a million gain recognized in fiscal  primarily related to resolution of the hylebos waterway litigation 
additionally  decreases in consolidated cost of goods sold and consolidated sg a expense were due to our implementation of cost containment measures that included a decrease in headcount of  the suspension of employer contributions to our defined contribution plans effective in march and other non labor cost reductions for fiscal consolidated sg a expense decreased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal primarily due to decreased compensation related expenses of million  and reduced expenses of million resulting from cost containment measures and other non compensation related costs including professional and outside services expense 
the reduction in compensation related expenses was primarily due to a decrease in annual incentive and share based compensation expense resulting from operating losses incurred and a million benefit arising from nondeductible executive incentive compensation that was awarded and included as nondeductible officers compensation for fiscal but was voluntarily and irrevocably declined in fiscal the decline in professional services expense was primarily the result of reduced consulting fees in fiscal also included in the consolidated operating loss for fiscal was a million gain related to a settlement agreement schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents to resolve disputes that had arisen from the separation and termination agreement relating to the dissolution of our joint venture with hugo neu in september these reductions were partially offset by a million increase in bad debt expense for fiscal compared to the prior year resulting from bankruptcies and adverse financial conditions experienced by certain of our customers  which affected their ability to satisfy their obligations 
interest expense interest expense was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal is the result of lower average interest rates and lower outstanding debt 
for more information about our outstanding debt balances  see note long term debt and capital lease obligations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
other income  net  excluding interest expense other income  net  excluding interest expense was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
other income decreased by million in fiscal compared to the prior year because fiscal included a pre tax gain of million from a settlement agreement relating to the dissolution of our joint venture with hugo neu in september income tax expense fiscal compared with fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was provision on income compared to benefit on a loss for fiscal the level of the decrease in the effective rate primarily reflects the impact of tax credits on lower taxable income loss in fiscal compared with fiscal  a lower state tax rate in fiscal resulting from the reduction in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits and a more favorable manufacturing deduction in fiscal which included the restoration of a previously disallowed deduction due to a newly enacted law 
fiscal also included a reduction in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits  which increased the effective rate benefit on the loss 
fiscal compared with fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was benefit on a loss compared to provision on income for fiscal the increase in the effective rate primarily reflects our net loss in fiscal  the contingent state tax liabilities that were reduced because a settlement was negotiated with one state and the statute of limitations expired in two other states and the non taxable income caused by the reversal of million of nondeductible executive incentive compensation expense that was treated as nondeductible in fiscal  and which was voluntarily and irrevocably declined in fiscal financial results by reporting segment we operate our business across three reporting segments mrb  apb and smb

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal revenues mrb revenues increased million  or  to billion for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to higher ferrous average net selling prices and higher nonferrous sales volumes  caused by increased demand for and availability of scrap metal 
ferrous revenues increased million  or  to billion for fiscal the increase in ferrous revenues was primarily driven by higher average net selling prices 
we experienced increasing prices during the year as the average net ferrous selling price increased per long ton  or  compared to the prior year due to strong demand in asian markets and to a lesser extent improved demand in domestic markets  which provided support to both domestic and foreign selling prices 
nonferrous revenues increased million  or  to million for fiscal the increase in nonferrous revenues was driven by increases in both the average nonferrous net selling price and sales volumes 
the average net selling price increased  or  to per pound during fiscal primarily due to stronger demand 
in addition  nonferrous volumes sold increased million pounds  or  to million pounds for fiscal  caused by increased recovery of nonferrous materials from the shredding process  more nonferrous collection activity and higher demand due to stronger global market conditions 
segment operating income operating income for mrb was million  or of revenues for fiscal compared to million  or  of revenues for fiscal the increase in operating income reflects the impact of improved worldwide demand for scrap and recycled metal  which led to higher average net selling prices that increased more than the average cost of raw materials  increased availability of raw materials and continued benefits from improved production operating efficiencies 
in addition  income from joint ventures increased by million over the prior year primarily due to the stronger demand for scrap metal 
included in fiscal operating income for mrb was a decrease in sg a expense of million compared to the prior year  primarily due to a reduction of million in bad debt expense  million in current year benefits from legal settlements and million in environmental cost reimbursements 
offsetting these decreases were a million increase in incentive compensation due to improvements in financial performance and a million increase in expense related to the amortization of intangibles 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues mrb revenues decreased billion  or  to billion for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to lower average net selling prices and lower sales volumes  caused by lower demand and reduced availability of raw materials due to weaker global market conditions in fiscal ferrous revenues decreased billion  or  to billion for fiscal this decrease was driven by reductions in both ferrous sales volumes and average net selling prices 
ferrous sales volumes decreased million tons  or  to million tons in fiscal ferrous foreign sales volumes decreased thousand tons  or  to million tons for fiscal due to a reduction in trading volumes 
ferrous domestic sales volumes decreased thousand tons  or  to thousand tons in fiscal these decreases in volume were primarily due to a combination of lower demand and reduced availability of raw materials 
we also experienced declining prices during the year as the average net ferrous selling price decreased per long ton  or  compared to the prior year due to lower demand and weaker global market conditions 
nonferrous revenues decreased million  or  to million for fiscal this decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in both the average nonferrous net selling price and sales volumes  caused by lower demand and weaker global market conditions

in addition  due to a combination of lower demand and reduced availability  nonferrous pounds shipped decreased million pounds  or  to million pounds for fiscal segment operating income operating income for mrb was million  or of revenues for fiscal compared to million  or of revenues for fiscal the decrease in operating income reflects the impact of the lower net selling prices for ferrous and nonferrous metal  which declined more than the costs of raw materials and freight  and decreased processed ferrous and nonferrous volumes that resulted in a non cash nrv inventory write down of million in fiscal in addition  income from joint ventures decreased by million  or over the prior year primarily due to the weaker demand for scrap metal 
weaker year over year demand and the impact of declines in selling prices  which outpaced the decline in purchase prices  combined with a number of customer renegotiations  deferrals  and cancellations during the first quarter of fiscal  resulted in the reduction in operating income 
offsetting the decreases in average selling prices and volume was a million decrease in mrb s sg a expense compared to the prior year  primarily due to million of lower compensation related expenses  including annual incentive compensation expense  resulting from our weaker financial and operating performance and decreased headcount  a million decrease in professional and outside services  and a million decrease in share based compensation expense  partially offset by an increase in bad debt of million and a million increase in legal reserves due to ongoing trade disputes 
also included in the operating income loss was a million release of environmental reserves and a million gain recognized in the first quarter of fiscal  primarily related to the resolution of the hylebos waterway litigation 
outlook mrb s results are dependent upon the worldwide demand for scrap metal which is used in the production of steel products  and on the available supply and cost of raw materials which are sourced in the united states 
despite the depressed worldwide economic conditions that continue to inhibit production by industrial producers of steel  we believe that the long term fundamentals supporting the demand for recycled metals remain positive 
as the market prices for scrap metal are subject to short term movements caused by changes in economic conditions  we are not able to provide guidance for market prices of scrap metal  however we expect volumes to be above those seen in fiscal auto parts business for the year ended august  increase decrease in thousands vs vs revenues cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expense environmental matters  nm segment operating income number of stores at period end cars purchased in thousands nm not meaningful fiscal compared with fiscal revenues apb s record self service revenues of million in fiscal represented an million  or  increase over fiscal the increase in revenues included a million increase in scrap vehicle revenue  a million increase schnitzer steel industries  inc form k

apb s results of operations do not include operating results from discontinued operations 
see note business combinations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues apb revenues decreased million  or  to million for fiscal  driven by reduced sales volumes and lower average selling prices for scrapped vehicles and cores resulting from the impact of the economic downturn 
this included a million decrease in scrap vehicle revenue due to a decrease in the average selling price for scrapped vehicles and a decrease of thousand tons  or  in volumes shipped 
core revenue decreased million over the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in the average selling price per core 
partially offsetting these decreases was parts revenue that increased million over the prior year 
segment operating income operating income for apb was million  or of revenues  for fiscal compared to million  or of revenues  for fiscal the decrease in operating income for fiscal reflects the impact of lower sales volumes and prices for scrapped vehicles and cores  and the impact of inventory costs not falling as rapidly as selling prices 
included in the operating income were reductions in sg a expense of million for fiscal  due to million in lower compensation related expenses  including incentive compensation  and reduced expenses resulting from cost containment measures which reduced headcount and other non compensation related costs compared to the same periods in the prior year 
outlook apb s results are dependent upon both the supply and cost of end of life vehicles as well as the market prices of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals  which are in turn a function of overall global economic conditions 
as average ferrous and nonferrous selling prices increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to improved worldwide demand for these metals  apb was able to raise its purchase prices of vehicles and still maintain its margins  which contributed to a record year in terms of revenue and operating income 
given current price levels  apb expects volumes in fiscal to be slightly above those seen in fiscal  with volumes from new stores acquired in fiscal likely offsetting the one time benefits of the government s cash for clunkers program

during fiscal  we continued our investment in general improvements at a number of our metals recycling facilities  including investments in technology to improve the recovery of nonferrous materials from the shredding process and investments to further improve efficiency and increase capacity  increase worker safety and enhance environmental systems 
we plan to invest up to million in capital expenditures in fiscal  which is expected to be spent on continued investments in technology to improve the recovery of nonferrous materials from the shredding process  material handling and processing equipment  enhancements to our information technology infrastructure  improvements for the facilities  environmental and safety infrastructure and normal equipment replacement and maintenance 
we believe these investments will create value for our shareholders 
we expect to use cash from operations and available lines of credit to fund capital expenditures in fiscal environmental compliance our commitment to sustainable recycling and operating our business in an environmentally responsible manner requires us to continue to invest in facilities that improve our environmental presence in the communities in which we operate 
consistent with this commitment  we invested million  million and million in capital expenditures for environmental projects in fiscal  and  respectively 
we plan to invest a further million in capital expenditures for environmental projects in fiscal these projects include investments in storm water systems and equipment to ensure ongoing compliance with air quality and other environmental regulations 
our environmental programs also require us to incur costs to remediate conditions at existing sites and to monitor previously remediated sites 
we incurred million  million and million in environmental expenditures  which were either expensed or reduced recorded reserves  in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect to incur similar amounts of expenditures going forward 
we have been identified by the epa as a prp that owns or operates or formerly owned or operated sites adjacent to the portland harbor superfund site 
because there has not been a determination of the total investigation costs  the remediation that will be required  the amount of natural resource damages or how the costs of the ongoing investigations and any remedy and natural resource damages will be allocated among the prps  it is not presently possible to estimate the costs which we are likely to incur in connection with the site  although such costs could be significant and material to our future cash flows 
recording of material liabilities related to the site could result in our failure to maintain compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements 
significant cash outflows in the future related to the site could reduce the amount of our borrowing capacity that could otherwise be used for investment in capital expenditures and acquisitions

contributions vary depending on the plan and are based upon plan provisions  actuarial valuations and negotiated labor agreements 
in fiscal  we froze further benefit accruals in schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents our defined benefit plan 
in fiscal  we made a million contribution to the defined benefit plan due to a reduction in its funding status as a result of a reduction in the single discount rate assumptions used for determining pension obligations 
while we do not anticipate making additional contributions to the defined benefit plan in fiscal  we may elect or be required to do so 
in addition  during fiscal we anticipate making million of contributions to the multiemployer plans in which we participate  including contributions totaling million for the multiemployer plan benefiting union employees of smb 
we believe any additional funding requirements will not have a material impact on our financial condition 
see note employee benefits in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further discussion of our retirement benefit plans 
effective in march  we suspended employer contributions to our defined contribution plans 
we resumed contributions to these plans in april and expect to make contributions of million to our defined contribution plans in fiscal assessment of liquidity and capital resources historically  our available cash resources  internally generated funds  credit facilities and equity offerings have financed our acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital and other financing needs 
we generally believe our current cash resources  internally generated funds  existing credit facilities and access to the capital markets will provide adequate financing for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital  joint ventures  stock repurchases  debt service requirements  post retirement obligations and future environmental obligations for the next months 
however  continued weak general market conditions may result in further utilizing our available credit lines and curtailing capital and operating expenditures  delaying or restricting acquisitions and share repurchases and reassessing working capital requirements 
should we determine  at any time  that we require additional short term liquidity  we will evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds  but there can be no assurance that any such supplemental funding  if sought  could be obtained or  if obtained  would be adequate or on acceptable terms 
however  we believe that our balance sheet as of august   expected cash flow from operations and existing credit facilities should provide additional sources of liquidity if required 
off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of operating leases and letters of credit  we are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we enter into operating leases for both new equipment and property

see note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for additional information 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified certain critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results 
these estimates require difficult and subjective judgments  including whether estimates are required to be made about matters that are inherently uncertain  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements 
significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible asset valuation  environmental costs  accounting for business combinations and revenue recognition 
inventories our inventories primarily consist of scrap metal ferrous  nonferrous  processed and unprocessed  nonferrous recovered joint product  used and salvaged vehicles  semi finished steel products billets and finished steel products primarily rebar  merchant bar and wire rod 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
mrb determines the cost of ferrous and nonferrous inventories principally using the average cost method and capitalizes substantially all direct costs and yard costs into inventory 
mrb allocates material and production costs to joint products using the gross margin method 
apb establishes cost for used and salvaged vehicle inventory based on the average price paid for a vehicle  capitalizing the vehicle cost into inventory 
smb establishes its finished steel product inventory cost based on a weighted average cost and capitalizes all direct and indirect costs of manufacturing into inventory 
indirect costs of manufacturing include general plant costs  maintenance and yard costs 
we evaluate whether our inventory is properly valued at the lower of cost or market on a quarterly basis 
we consider estimated future selling prices when schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents determining the estimated net realizable value for our inventory 
however  as mrb generally sells its export recycled ferrous metal under contracts that provide for shipment within to days after the price is agreed  it utilizes the selling prices under committed contracts and sales orders for determining the estimated market price of quantities on hand that will be shipped under these contracts and orders 
the accounting process we use to record unprocessed metal and used and salvaged vehicle inventory quantities relies on significant estimates 
with respect to unprocessed metal inventory  we rely on weighed quantities that are reduced by estimated amounts that are moved into production 
these estimates utilize estimated recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends 
over time  these estimates are reasonably good indicators of what is ultimately produced  however  actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality  moisture content and source of the unprocessed metal 
if ultimate recoveries and yields are significantly different than estimated  the value of our inventory could be materially overstated or understated 
to assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates  we run periodic tests and perform monthly physical inventory estimates 
however  due to variations in product density  holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the product  physical inventories will not necessarily detect all variances 
to mitigate this risk  we adjust the ferrous physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory count can more accurately predict the remaining volume 
goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and intangibles with an indefinite life annually during the second fiscal quarter and upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting segment level 
our reporting segments  for which goodwill has been allocated  are equivalent to our operating segments  as all of the components of the respective segments have similar economic characteristics 
the goodwill impairment test follows a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of a reporting segment is compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting segment exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting segment is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting segment to determine an implied goodwill value 
this allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation 
if the carrying amount of the reporting segment s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
in the event of a divestiture of a business unit within a reporting segment  goodwill of the reporting segment is allocated to that business unit based on the fair value of the unit being divested to the total fair value of the reporting segment and a gain or loss is determined 
the remaining goodwill in the reporting segment from which the assets were divested is subsequently re evaluated for impairment 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting segments using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows utilizing a market based weighted average cost of capital wacc 
to estimate the cash flows that extend beyond the final year of the discounted cash flow model  we employ a terminal value technique  whereby we use estimated operating cash flows minus capital expenditures and adjust for changes in working capital requirements in the final year of the model  then discount it by the wacc to establish the terminal value 
we include the present value of the terminal value in the fair value estimate 
given that market prices of our reporting segments are not readily available  we make various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting segments  which is the price that would be received to sell the reporting segment as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  pricing expectations and general market conditions 
in addition  we test indefinite lived intangibles for impairment by either comparing the carrying value of the intangible to the projected discounted cash flows from the intangible or using the relief from royalties method 
if the carrying value exceeds the projected discounted cash flows attributed to the intangible asset  the carrying value is no longer considered recoverable and we will record an impairment

table of contents environmental costs we operate in industries that inherently possess environmental risks 
to manage these risks  we employ both our own environmental staff and outside consultants 
environmental staff and finance personnel meet regularly to stay updated on environmental risks 
we estimate future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrue for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated but the timing of incurring the estimated costs is unknown 
the regulatory and government management of these projects is complex  which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation 
when only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established and no other amount within the range is better than another  the low end of the range is recorded in the financial statements 
if further developments or resolution of an environmental matter result in facts and circumstances that are significantly different than the assumptions used to develop these reserves  the accrual for environmental remediation could be materially understated or overstated 
adjustments to these liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues or when expenditures for which reserves are established are made 
the factors we consider in the recognition and measurement of environmental liabilities include current regulations  both at the time the reserve is established and during the course of the remediation process  which specify standards for acceptable remediation  information about the site which becomes available as the site is studied and remediated  the professional judgment of senior level internal staff  who take into account similar  recent instances of environmental remediation issues  and studies of our sites  among other considerations  technologies available that can be used for remediation  and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties and the extent of their responsibility for the costs of study and remediation 
the accrued environmental liabilities as of august  included million related to third party investigation costs for the portland harbor superfund site 
although future costs for the portland harbor superfund site could be material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows  it is not possible to estimate additional costs which we might incur in connection with the ongoing investigations and remediation because there has not been a determination of the total investigation costs  the remediation that will be required  the amount of natural resource damages or how the costs of the ongoing investigations and any remedy and natural resource damages will be allocated among the prps 
as such  it is not presently possible to estimate the costs which we are likely to incur in connection with the site and therefore no amounts have been accrued 
see contingencies environmental in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
business combinations on september   we adopted the revised accounting standard for business combinations  which requires us to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  generally using a market based income approach 
measuring assets and liabilities at fair value requires us to determine the price that would be paid by a third party market participant based on the highest and best use of the assets or interests acquired 
we utilize management estimates that incorporate input from an independent third party valuation firm in our determination of these fair values 
such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions  including projections of future events and operating performance and determining the highest and best use of the assets or interests acquired 
in addition  following the adoption of this standard  acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when we have a contract or purchase order from a customer with a fixed price  the title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer and collectibility is reasonably assured 
title for both metal and finished steel products schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents transfers based on contract terms 
a significant portion of our ferrous export sales of recycled metal are made with letters of credit  reducing credit risk 
however  domestic recycled ferrous metal sales  nonferrous sales and sales of finished steel are generally made on open account 
nonferrous export sales typically require a deposit prior to shipment 
all sales made on open account are evaluated for collectibility prior to revenue recognition 
additionally  we recognize revenues on partially loaded shipments when detailed documents support revenue recognition based on transfer of title and risk of loss 
for apb  retail revenues are recognized when customers pay for parts and wholesale product revenues are recognized when customer weight certificates are received following shipment 
historically  there have been very few sales returns and adjustments that impact the ultimate collection of revenues  therefore  no material provisions have been made when the sale is recognized 
we present taxes assessed by governmental authorities collected from customers on a net basis 
therefore  the taxes are excluded from revenue and are shown as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet until remitted

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are exposed to commodity price risk  mainly associated with variations in the market price for finished steel products  ferrous and nonferrous metals  including scrap metal  autobodies and other commodities 
the timing and magnitude of industry cycles are difficult to predict and are impacted by general economic conditions 
we respond to increases and decreases in forward selling prices by adjusting purchase prices on a timely basis 
we actively manage our exposure to commodity price risk and monitor the actual and expected spread between forward selling prices and purchase costs and processing and shipping expense 
sales contracts are based on prices negotiated with our customers  and generally orders are placed to days ahead of shipment date 
however  financial results may be negatively impacted when forward selling prices fall more quickly than we can adjust purchase prices or when customers fail to meet their contractual obligations 
we assess the net realizable value of inventory each quarter based upon contracted sales orders and estimated future selling prices 
based on contracted sales and estimates of future selling prices at august   a decrease in the selling price per ton of finished steel products would cause an nrv inventory write down of approximately million at smb 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related to our debt obligations 
our credit line and revolving credit facility are variable in rate and therefore have exposure to changes in interest rates 
if market interest rates had changed from actual interest rate levels in fiscal or  the effect on our interest expense and net income would not have been material 
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss that might occur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations to take delivery of scrap metal and finished steel products and to make financial settlements of these obligations 
we manage our exposure to credit risk through a variety of methods  including shipping ferrous scrap metal exports under letters of credit  collection of deposits prior to shipment for certain nonferrous export customers and establishment of credit limits for sales on open terms 
mrb generally ships ferrous bulk sales to foreign customers under contracts supported by letters of credit issued or confirmed by banks it deems credit worthy 
the letters of credit ensure payment by the customer 
as mrb generally sells its export recycled ferrous metal under contracts or orders that generally provide for shipment within to days after the price is agreed  mrb s customers typically do not have difficulty obtaining letters of credit from their banks in periods of rising ferrous prices  as the value of the letters of credit are collateralized by the value of the inventory on the ship 
however  in periods of declining prices  mrb s customers may not be able to obtain letters of credit for the full sales value of the inventory to be shipped 
as such  we may need to extend credit on open terms for the difference between the sales value under the contract and the value supported by the letter of credit 
in addition  we could be exposed to loss if a customer fails to pay or the bank providing the letter of credit fails 
as of august  and  and  respectively  of our trade accounts receivable balance was covered by letters of credit 
of the remaining balance as of august   was less than days past due  compared to as of august  schnitzer steel industries  inc form k
