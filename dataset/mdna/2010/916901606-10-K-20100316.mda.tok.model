the words believes  expects  projects  targets  estimates or similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
we do not undertake to update  revise or correct any of the forward looking information 
readers are cautioned that such forward looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading risk factors beginning on page overview uri explores for and produces uranium in south texas where it has two remaining production operations that are currently on stand by kingsville dome and rosita 
uri also has an estimated million pounds of in place mineralized uranium material on  acres in new mexico 
our operations are heavily influenced by the price of uranium both on the spot and long term markets 
the spot price of uranium  which has fluctuated from a high of per pound in june to its recent price level of per pound  has been the primary driver of the strategic decisions of the company 

table of contents our strategy has been focused on two fronts advancing our new mexico assets towards production  and expanding our reserve base in texas so we can continue to generate cash from operations to sustain our efforts in new mexico 
during  with a continuing weakening of the uranium market prices that began in early  we focused on reducing costs  restoration activities in texas  public and government relations efforts in new mexico and preserving cash 
after we concluded production from our two remaining wellfields in texas in july  we no longer had a source of revenue 
south texas production we produced  pounds of uranium from our south texas operations in and currently have no production operations 
current activity at kingsville dome is primarily focused on the restoration of depleted wellfields 
the last wellfield at vasquez was fully depleted in october and the project is now undergoing restoration 
production from rosita was started in june  but was suspended in october due to poor economics driven by increased operating costs as a result of technical operating challenges and the decreased price of uranium 
we are currently in the stabilization phase of groundwater restoration at the rosita project 
reserve development a significant portion of the cash on hand at december  was generated from the million in net proceeds received from the sale of common stock and warrants in a private placement in may the equity was raised to fund the acquisition  exploration  permitting and development of new and existing properties in south texas to increase our resource base in an effort to extend production at our texas operations beyond and for general corporate purposes 
these activities were halted when uranium prices declined in and due to higher costs  combined with geologic and technical risk and unknown market risk  we have chosen to suspend our exploration activities until the economics justify further activity 
we are seeking opportunities for the rights to potential uranium properties in south texas and new mexico in geographic areas that have historically held significant uranium resources 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the acquisition of such properties  or if acquired  that such properties will contain commercially viable uranium deposits 
financial condition and results of operations comparison of twelve months ended december   and production and production costs 
our uranium production was  in   pounds in and  pounds in production began at our vasquez project in the fourth quarter of and reached peak production output in in and we saw a decline in vasquez production and the start up of production from our kingsville dome project 
this trend continued in and the start up of production from the first new production from our production area at kingsville dome in january resulted in the production increases in over in  we placed five new wellfields into production at kingsville dome and one new wellfield at vasquez 
these wellfields were less prolific than the wellfields produced in three of the kingsville dome wellfields and the vasquez wellfields were produced out in the remaining two wellfields at kingsville dome completed production in the second quarter of production at our rosita project began with oxygen injection in june and resulted in low levels of production using our standard in situ recovery mining techniques 
in late july  we employed a series of alternative operational strategies including the use of various oxidants in an attempt to improve recovery levels 
while these tests did improve production over previous levels  the higher cost of production combined with lower uranium prices did not allow the operation to continue on a positive cash basis and production was suspended in the fourth quarter of although technically challenging  we believe the reserves from rosita can be produced economically with higher uranium prices 
we completed production at the vasquez project and shut in production at the rosita project in the fourth quarter of and we shut in production at the kingsville dome project in the second quarter of the vasquez project was mined out in and is now being restored 
at the kingsville dome and rosita projects  we shut in production to conserve the in place reserve base in response to a drop in uranium market prices 
we do not intend to resume production at these sites until there is a significant recovery of uranium prices 
the following table details our production and production cost breakdown for the year ended december   and 
table of contents kingsville dome production vasquez production rosita production total production total operating costs per pound operating costs total depreciation and depletion costs per pound dd a cost total production cost production cost per pound total operating costs  total depreciation and depletion costs and total production costs incurred for the periods presented above differ from the cost of uranium sales recorded in consolidated statements of operations because of changes in the amounts recorded to inventory for the same periods 
the cost of uranium sales amounts include the sales of uranium inventory on hand at the beginning of the period and do not include uranium produced during the period but not sold at period end 
the following table provides a reconciliation of production costs to cost of uranium sales for the year ended december   and operating costs change in uranium inventory operating expense for uranium production sold depreciation and depletion costs change in uranium inventory depreciation and depletion for uranium production sold total production costs change in uranium inventory direct cost of uranium production sold total dollars expended for direct production costs in were significantly lower than as a result of the scale back of production during the year when compared to the reduced production volumes in resulted from the decline in uranium prices throughout which led to the company s decision in october to defer new wellfield development 
production at kingsville dome was completed in july at which time the company ceased having any operating wellfields in texas 
our direct production costs in increased compared with costs 
these total cost increases resulted from production being sourced from higher cost kingsville dome and vasquez wellfields in and from the unfavorable results we saw from our rosita production during uranium sales 
in  we sold a total of  pounds of uranium produced from our kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita projects  resulting in revenue of million 
in  we sold a total of  pounds of uranium produced from our kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita projects  resulting in revenue of million 
in  we sold a total of  pounds of uranium produced from our kingsville dome and vasquez projects  resulting in revenue of million 
cost of uranium sales 
our direct production costs for uranium sales made in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
our total cost of uranium sales is comprised of such production costs  including operating expenses  depreciation and depletion expenses  and also includes royalties and commissions related to our uranium sales  amortization of our restoration and reclamation cost estimates  exploration costs incurred during the year and impairment provisions for uranium properties 
the following table details our production and royalties commissions cost of uranium sales breakdown for the years ended december   and 
table of contents total pounds sold total operating expenses per pound operating expense depreciation and depletion per pound dd a expense direct cost of uranium production sold direct cost of sales per pound royalties and commissions royalties and commissions per pound overall production costs in were significantly lower than as a result of the scale back of production volumes during the year when compared to these lower volumes  which caused lower sales volumes  also resulted in lower total royalties and commissions in our kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita projects all experienced higher production costs in than our production from kingsville dome and vasquez in the higher costs at kingsville dome and vasquez were the result of production being sourced from lesser quality ore reserves and the wind down of production at each of these projects during the year 
as the production life of a wellfield extends  the costs to produce those pounds is higher than when a wellfield is first placed into production 
we experienced production difficulties at rosita which forced us to try a number of methodologies in an attempt to increase our production efficiencies 
the operating costs incurred  the lack of significant progress in resolving our production inefficiencies at rosita and the decision to not make the capital expenditures to increase the number of production wells resulted in our high production costs at rosita during the year 
our average cost of pounds sold in was per pound with kingsville dome production contributing approximately of total pounds sold  vasquez contributing approximately of total pounds sold and rosita contributing approximately of total pounds sold during the year 
we saw an improvement in our overall production costs in  with the majority of our production in coming from new wellfields at our kingsville dome project  we saw benefits of this historically lower cost production contributing significantly to reducing both our operating and capital costs of production in our average cost of pounds sold in was per pound with kingsville dome production contributing approximately and vasquez contributing approximately of the total pounds sold during the year 
royalties and commissions 
during  royalties and commissions for kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita production sold was  representing a charge of of sales 
during  royalties and commissions for kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita production sold was million  representing a charge of of sales 
during  royalties and commissions for vasquez and kingsville dome production sold was million  representing a charge of of sales 
the changes in royalty percentages from to and resulted primarily from the changes in uranium sales prices year to year and the source of our production in each year 
our vasquez leases contain a sliding scale royalty with percentages that range from up to dependent on our sales prices 
our kingsville dome leases have a royalty and carry an additional royalty payment to certain land owners of the property 
our rosita leases contain royalty rates 
operating expenses 
during  operating expenses for kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita production sold was million which included  of stand by and other operating costs at our south texas projects which were charged to operations 
during  operating expenses for kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita production sold was million 
in we incurred  of stand by costs at the rosita project  which were charged to operations 
during  operating expenses for vasquez and kingsville dome production sold was million 
in we incurred  of stand by costs at the rosita project  which costs were charged to operations 
depreciation and depletion 
during  we incurred depreciation and depletion expense attributable to our kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita production of million 
during  we incurred depreciation and depletion expense attributable to our kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita production of million 
during  we incurred depreciation and depletion expense attributable to our vasquez and kingsville dome production of million 
impairment of uranium properties 
during  and  we determined the carrying value of our uranium project assets exceeded their fair value 
such determination in resulted in an impairment provision of million 
the impairment provision reduced the carrying value of kingsville dome by million  rosita by  vasquez by  and other south texas projects by  at december  in our impairment provision totaled million reducing the carrying value of kingsville dome by million  rosita by million and vasquez by million at december  the impairment provision in resulted primarily from our reducing the estimated recoverable reserves projected to be produced from vasquez in the future and resulted in an impairment provision related to the vasquez project assets of approximately accretion and amortization of future restoration costs 
during  and  the accretion and amortization of future restoration costs was   and  respectively 

table of contents general and administrative charges 
we incurred general and administrative charges and corporate depreciation of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
significant expenditures for general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and were year ended amounts in s stock compensation expense salaries and payroll burden legal  accounting  public company expenses write off of target acquisition costs insurance and bank fees consulting and professional services office expenses travel and other expenses total the non cash compensation expense recorded for the years ended december   and resulted from the adoption of a new accounting standard in january  requiring the recognition of expense related to the fair value of the company s stock option grants 
the value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the option award and stock price volatility 
the expected term of options granted was derived from historical data on our employee exercise and post vesting employment termination experience 
the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we made significant reductions in salary and payroll costs in compared with the  or decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in personnel headcount that resulted from lower activities created by the shut down of the company s production during the current year 
salary and payroll costs were up slightly in compared with the  or increase resulted primarily from increased personnel and benefits and a reduction in personnel costs allocated to operations and projects during the current year 
salary and payroll cost increases of million in resulted primarily from the addition of salaried positions primarily in south texas and new mexico during the year and the cash bonuses awarded to non executive employees at year end the company s legal  accounting and public company expenses had a net decrease of  in compared with the decrease resulted from reduced audit and sarbanes oxley section sox related costs during the year offset by increases in legal fees 
the company s legal  accounting and public company expenses had a net decrease of  in compared with the decrease related to lower sox audit related costs in and nasdaq listing fees  decreased directors fees and costs related to the preparation for a planned listing on the toronto stock exchange incurred in the company s legal  accounting and public company expenses had a net increase of  in the primary increases in these costs were from sox audit related costs  nasdaq listing fees  higher directors fees related to the addition of two independent directors during and increased director participation in strategic planning activities and costs related to the preparation for a planned listing on the toronto stock exchange 
these increased costs were somewhat offset by a reduction of legal costs charged to general and administrative costs during the year 
the primary reduction related to a significant amount of legal activity in related to the negotiation and preparation of the joint venture in new mexico with itochu corporation 
insurance costs decreased in compared to as a result of lower general liability and umbrella coverage premiums which saw reductions because of overall reductions in payroll during the year 
insurance costs increased in compared to primarily as a result of an increase in our directors and officers liability premiums which rose during the year primarily as a result of increased coverage limits in compared with the prior year 
insurance costs increased in primarily as a result of an increase in our general liability premiums 
these premiums rose during the year as a result of increases in production activities seen in compared with the prior year 
we also had increases in our property and casualty premiums resulting from increased vehicle coverage because of additional vehicles acquired in bank fees also increased in as a result of additions made to our financial surety requirements for our south texas uranium projects 
consulting and professional service expenses were reduced significantly in compared to the prior year as a result of lower public relations costs associated with new mexico community relations and community information education activities during the current year 
this reduced spending resulted in savings of approximately  year over year 
the costs for consulting and 
table of contents professional services decreased by  compared with and was related primarily to a reduction in costs for financial advisory services provided by a non employee director of the company in 
the costs for consulting and professional services increased by million compared with the increased costs were a result of heightened activities involving work performed to review and assess our new mexico property databases for their evaluation as potential conventional mining projects  the expansion of a broad community relations and community information education effort in both south texas and new mexico  investor relations costs  costs for financial advisory services provided by a non employee director of the company  and other advisory fees in texas 
reduced office related costs in resulted from closures of the company s new mexico and corpus christi office locations along with peripheral office related costs reductions resulting from the reductions in work force seen in increased office costs in compared with resulted primarily from the full year costs of the lewisville  texas and albuquerque  new mexico offices offset by cost reductions realized by the closure of the corpus christi office mid year increased office costs in compared with resulted primarily from the opening of a new corporate office location in albuquerque  new mexico  in october   the move of the corporate headquarters to larger office space in september  the costs for the corpus christi office for the entire year and increases in the south texas kingsville operations office resulting from the personnel added during the year 
write off of target acquisition costs 
in june  the company and billiton investment bv agreed to terminate our agreement to purchase rio algom mining  llc  which was entered into on october  in connection with the targeted acquisition  we incurred costs of million dollars which were originally recorded as a pre acquisition cost asset 
upon the termination of the agreement these pre acquisition costs were expensed in net income loss 
for the year ended december  we had a net loss of million compared to a net loss of million in and net income of million in on a diluted per share basis  losses were in compared with losses of in and net income of in  respectively 
the and results include an impairment provision for the kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita projects of million and million  respectively and exploration charges of  and million  respectively 
the results include an impairment provision for the vasquez project of  and exploration charges of  cash flow 
as of december  we had a cash balance of approximately million compared with approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
in  we had a negative cash flow from operations of million  resulting primarily from our low uranium production and related sales volumes seen during the year 
as a result of the deferral of wellfield development activities  our capital expenditures used in investing activities were reduced by approximately million compared to in  we generated million of cash flow from operations  resulting from our uranium production activities during the year 
in  we raised net proceeds of approximately million through the sale of  shares at per share in may and  from the issuance of  shares from the exercise of employee stock options 
we also used million in investing activities  including million of capital additions for our south texas production projects 
these expenditures primarily consisted of wellfield evaluation  delineation and development costs of million and plant and equipment additions of  at kingsville dome 
wellfield evaluation and development costs were million and plant and equipment additions totaled million at the rosita project during costs at the vasquez project were  in and were primarily for wellfield development and land holding costs and we spent approximately  for evaluation and delineation activities at the company s rosita south project during in  we generated million of cash flow from operations  resulting primarily from our increased production and reduced production costs incurred during the year 
we also used million in investing activities  including million of capital additions for our main south texas projects 
these expenditures primarily consisted of wellfield evaluation  delineation and development costs of million and plant and equipment additions of million at kingsville dome 
wellfield evaluation and development costs were million and plant and equipment additions totaled million at the rosita project during costs for wellfield development and plant and equipment totaled million at the vasquez project in and we spent approximately million for evaluation and delineation activities at the company s rosita south project 

table of contents in  we generated million from the issuance of  shares from the exercise of employee stock options 
liquidity cash sources and uses for as of december   the company had million in cash 
the company deferred the development of new wellfields at kingsville dome and rosita beginning in late this action resulted in the wind down of our uranium production activities by mid and a corresponding reduction in uranium sales which was the primary reason for our million of cash used in operations in as of december  the company had sold its entire uranium inventory and as such  sales revenue and related cash inflows for the company are expected to be nominal in during we continued the actions begun in the second half of  significantly decreasing our cost structure by implementing tighter spending controls  reducing employment  limiting exploration activities  and reducing public and government relations activities in new mexico and texas 
the company expects to raise additional capital in through a financing transaction  the monetization of non core assets or other means 
absent the ability to complete one or more of these actions the company would need to implement significant cost cutting measures designed to maintain the company s liquidity for a period of to fifteen months 
while the company believes it will be successful in its capital raising efforts  there can be no assurance that such activities will result in the raising of sufficient funds to allow the company to continue operations beyond however  we do project that with the cash on hand at december  and with the ability to sufficiently reduce our controllable costs we will be able to maintain our liquidity through off balance sheet arrangements the company has obtained financial surety relating to certain of its future restoration and reclamation obligations as required by the state of texas regulatory agencies 
the company has bank letters of credit the l c s and performance bonds issued for the benefit of the company to satisfy such regulatory requirements 
the l c s were issued by bank of america and the performance bonds have been issued by united states fidelity and guaranty company usf g 
l c s for   and  at december   and  respectively such l c s are collateralized in their entirety by certificates of deposit 
performance bonds totaling  were issued for the benefit of the company at december   and usf g has required that the company deposit funds collateralizing a portion of the bonds 
the amount of bonding issued by usf g exceeded the amount of collateral by million at december   and  respectively 
in the event that usf g is required to perform under its bonds or the bonds are called by the state agencies  the company would be obligated to pay any expenditure in excess of the collateral 
contractual obligations the table below sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of future payments relating to our most significant contractual obligations as of december   except as otherwise noted 
payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years capital leases corporate office lease crownpoint total critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements on page f of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies involve those requiring the use of significant estimates and assumptions in determining values or projecting future costs 

table of contents specifically regarding our uranium properties  significant estimates were utilized in determining the carrying value of these assets 
these assets have been recorded at their estimated net realizable value for impairment purposes on a liquidation basis  which is less than our cost 
the actual value realized from these assets may vary significantly from these estimates based upon market conditions  financing availability and other factors 
regarding our reserve for future restoration and reclamation costs  significant estimates were utilized in determining the future costs to complete the groundwater restoration and surface reclamation at our mine sites 
the actual cost to conduct these activities may vary significantly from these estimates 
such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
the accounts of the company are maintained in united states dollars 
all dollar amounts in the financial statements are stated in united states dollars except where indicated 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements the accounting standards codification 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 
the codification or asc 
the codification reorganized existing us accounting and reporting standards issued by the fasb and other related private sector standard setters into a single source of authoritative accounting principles arranged by topic 
the codification supersedes all existing us accounting standards  all other accounting literature not included in the codification other than securities and exchange commission guidance for publicly traded companies is considered non authoritative 
the codification was effective on a prospective basis for interim and annual reporting periods ending after september  the adoption of the codification changed the company s references to us gaap accounting standards but did not impact the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
business combinations 
in december  the fasb issued revised guidance for the accounting for business combinations 
the revised guidance  which is now part of asc  business combinations asc  requires the fair value measurement of assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  at the acquisition date with limited exceptions 
previously  a cost allocation approach was used to allocate the cost of the acquisition based on the estimated fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the cost allocation approach treated acquisition related costs and restructuring costs that the acquirer expected to incur as a liability on the acquisition date  as part of the cost of the acquisition 
under the revised guidance  those costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of income separately from the business combination 
in addition  the revised guidance includes recognition  classification and measurement guidance for assets and liabilities related to insurance and reinsurance contracts acquired in a business combination 
the revised guidance applies to business combinations for acquisitions occurring on or after january  the company adopted this standard on january  which did not have an impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows as there have been no acquisitions that have been consummated after january  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance for the accounting for noncontrolling interests 
the new guidance  which is now a part of asc  consolidation  establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
in addition  it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements 
the provisions of the new guidance were effective on a prospective basis beginning january   except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which are applied on a retrospective basis for all periods presented 
the adoption of the new guidance on january  did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows as the company owns of its subsidiaries 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in march  the fasb issued new guidance on the disclosure of derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the new guidance  which is now a part of asc  derivatives and hedging activities  requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of  and gains and losses on  derivative instruments  and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements 
the provisions of the new guidance were effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of the new guidance on january  did not result in a change in the company s disclosure since there were no derivative instruments or hedging activities after january  
table of contents determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance on a financial instrument that is indexed to an entity s own stock 
the new guidance  which is now a part of asc  determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early application is not permitted 
asc specifies that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative but is both a indexed to the company s own stock and b classified in stockholders equity in the statement of financial position would not be considered a derivative financial instrument 
asc provides a new two step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer s own stock and thus able to qualify for the scope exception 
the application of this guidance at january  did not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued new guidance for the accounting for non financial assets and non financial liabilities 
the new guidance  which is now a part of asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  permitted a one year deferral of the application of fair value accounting for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
beginning january   we applied asc to nonrecurring  nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
this adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations or financial condition 
our asset retirement obligation is classified as a level liability within the valuation hierarchy 
the significant unobservable inputs to this fair value measurement include estimates of plugging  abandonment and restoration costs  inflation rate and the expected remaining life of wellfields 
the inputs are calculated based on historical data as well as current estimated costs 
see note other liabilities and deferred credits for additional information regarding our asset retirement obligation as of december  subsequent events 
in may  the fasb issued new guidance for accounting for subsequent events 
the new guidance  which is now part of asc  subsequent events  is consistent with existing auditing standards in defining subsequent events as events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued  but it also requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date 
the new guidance defines two types of subsequent events recognized subsequent events and non recognized subsequent events 
recognized subsequent events provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date and must be reflected in the company s financial statements 
non recognized subsequent events provide evidence about conditions that arose after the balance sheet date and are not reflected in the financial statements of a company 
certain non recognized subsequent events may require disclosure to prevent the financial statements from being misleading 
the new guidance was effective on a prospective basis for interim or annual periods ending after june  we adopted asc on june  and have included the required disclosures in this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk uranium price volatility the company is subject to market risk related to the market price of uranium 
the company s cash flow has historically been dependent on the price of uranium  which is determined primarily by global supply and demand  relative to the company s costs of production 
historically  uranium prices have been subject to fluctuation  and the price of uranium has been and will continue to be affected by numerous factors beyond the company s control  including the demand for nuclear power  political and economic conditions  and governmental legislation in uranium producing and consuming countries and production levels and costs of production of other producing companies 
the spot market price for uranium has demonstrated a large range since january prices have risen from per pound at january to a high of per pound as of june the spot market price was per pound as of march
