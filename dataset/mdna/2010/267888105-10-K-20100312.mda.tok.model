item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes  as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
unless stated otherwise  all dollar figures in this discussion are presented in thousands s 
executive overview prior to late  our business had been organized into two segments explosive metalworking which we also refer to as dmc clad and amk welding 
on november   we acquired ownership of a german company  dynaenergetics 
dynaenergetics operates two distinct businesses which have historically been known as dynaplat and dynaenergetics 
dynaplat is a manufacturer of explosion clad products similar to those manufactured by dmc clad  and its operating results from the date of acquisition are included in our explosive metalworking segment 
dynaenergetics manufactures a number of products for the perforation of oil and gas wells and also distributes a line of seismic products for oil and gas exploration activities 
dynaenergetcs operating results from the date of acquisition are reported under a new segment that we have named oilfield products 
in  explosive metalworking accounted for of our net sales and of our income from operations before consideration of stock based compensation expense  which is not allocated to our business segments 
our oilfield products and amk welding segments accounted for and  respectively  of our net sales 
in and  explosive metalworking accounted for more than and of our net sales  respectively  and and of income from operations  respectively 
our net sales decreased by  or  compared to net sales 
the year to year consolidated net sales decrease reflects sales decreases of  for our explosive metalworking segment   for our oilfield products segment and for amk welding 
income from operations decreased to  in from  in this  decrease reflects declines in the operating income reported by our explosive metalworking  oilfield products and amk welding segments of   and  respectively  and an increase in stock based compensation expense of reported consolidated operating income for and for includes amortization expense of  and  respectively  relating to purchased intangible assets associated principally with our acquisition of dynaenergetics 
our net income decreased by to  in from  in impact of current economic situation on the company 
the company was only minimally impacted in by the global economic slowdown 
however  during  we have seen a significant slowdown in explosive metalworking sales to some of the markets we serve 
the explosion welded clad plate market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a number of heavy industries  including oil and gas  alternative energy  chemicals and petrochemicals  hydrometallurgy  aluminum production  shipbuilding  power generation  and industrial refrigeration 
these industries tend to be cyclical in nature and the current worldwide economic downturn has affected many of these markets 
despite the slowdown we have already seen in certain sectors  including chemical  petrochemical and hydrometallurgy  quoting activity in other end markets remains healthy  and we continue to track an extensive list of large infrastructure projects 
while timing of new order inflow remains difficult to predict  we believe that our explosive metalworking segment is well positioned to benefit as global economic conditions improve 
as a result of our explosive metalworking backlog decreasing from  at december  to  at december  and relatively low booking activity during the first two months of  we believe that our consolidated net sales could decline by as much as from consolidated net sales that we reported in however  if booking activity for both our explosive metalworking and oilfield products business segments improves during the middle quarters of  our consolidated net sales could approach those of in light of the slowdown in order inflow that we have experienced  we continue to manage expenses carefully 
despite the significant sales and net income declines that we reported in  we generated cash flow from operations of  in and expect to generate positive cash flow from operations for the full year 
table of contents net sales explosive metalworking s revenues are generated principally from sales of clad metal plates and sales of transition joints  which are made from clad plates  to customers that fabricate industrial equipment for various industries  including oil and gas  petrochemicals  alternative energy  hydrometallurgy  aluminum production  shipbuilding  power generation  industrial refrigeration  and similar industries 
while a large portion of the demand for our clad metal products is driven by new plant construction and large plant expansion projects  maintenance and retrofit projects at existing chemical processing  petrochemical processing  oil refining  and aluminum smelting facilities also account for a significant portion of total demand 
oilfield products revenues are generated principally from sales of shaped charges  detonators and detonating cord  and bidirectional booster sand perforating guns to customers who perform the perforation of oil and gas wells and from sales of seismic products to customers involved in oil and gas exploration activities 
amk welding s revenues are generated from welding  heat treatment  and inspection services that are provided with respect to customer supplied parts for customers primarily involved in the power generation industry and aircraft engine markets 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers  therefore  the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis  to receive payment for such services in a timely manner  or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities 
we attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving product quality  delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price 
gross profit and cost of products sold cost of products sold for explosive metalworking includes the cost of metals and alloys used to manufacture clad metal plates  the cost of explosives  employee compensation and benefits  freight  outside processing costs  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
cost of products sold for oilfield products includes the cost of metals  explosives and other raw materials used to manufacture shaped charges  detonating products and perforating guns as well as employee compensation and benefits  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
amk welding s cost of products sold consists principally of employee compensation and benefits  welding supplies wire and gas  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  outside services and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
income taxes our effective income tax rate increased to in from in income tax provisions on the earnings of nobelclad  nitro metall  dynaplat  dynaenergetics  dynaenergetics canada  and our german and luxembourg holding companies have been provided based upon the respective french  swedish  german  canadian  and luxembourg statutory tax rates for the applicable years 
going forward  based upon existing tax regulations and current federal  state and foreign statutory tax rates  we expect our effective tax rate on our projected consolidated pre tax income to range between and 

table of contents backlog we use backlog as a primary means of measuring the immediate outlook for our business 
we define backlog at any given point in time as consisting of all firm  unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time 
generally speaking  we expect to fill most backlog orders within the following months 
from experience  most firm purchase orders and commitments are realized 
our backlog with respect to the explosive metalworking segment decreased to  at december   from  at december  in light of the slowdown in order inflow and decrease in backlog that we have experienced  we are currently anticipating that our consolidated net sales for fiscal will be in a range of flat to down from the consolidated net sales that we reported in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales percentage change change net sales net sales for decreased to  from  in explosive metalworking sales decreased to  in of total sales from  in of total sales 
the decrease in explosive metalworking sales reflects a business slowdown in several of the industries that this business segment serves and includes approximately million of unfavorable foreign exchange translation adjustments 
oilfield products contributed  to sales in of total sales compared to  in of total sales 
the  or decline in sales  which includes incremental sales of  from the lri acquisition  reflects both a volume decrease and a negative impact of approximately from unfavorable foreign exchange adjustments 
amk welding contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales  a decline of gross profit percentage change change gross profit consolidated gross profit margin rate gross profit decreased by to  in from  in our consolidated gross profit margin rate decreased to from in the gross profit margin for explosive metalworking decreased from in to in oilfield products reported a gross margin of in compared to a gross margin of in the gross profit margin for amk welding decreased to in from in the decreased gross profit margin rate for explosive metalworking relates almost entirely to our european cladding operations where the gross margin rate for the year was lower than the gross margin rate reported in on a year to year sales decline of 
our us clad division reported only a slightly lower gross margin rate of in compared to in despite a drop in sales 
historically  gross margins for our european explosion welding divisions have been lower than those reported by our us division due to less efficient fixed manufacturing cost structures associated with our smaller european facilities 
we have taken steps to reduce fixed manufacturing overhead costs at all of our facilities  but the benefit of these actions on our gross margin performance will likely be offset by the expected continuation of a very competitive pricing environment 
during the gross margins that we reported in our quarterly financial statements ranged from a low of in the fourth quarter to a high of in the first quarter 
we expect to see continued fluctuations in our quarterly gross margin rates during that result from anticipated fluctuations in quarterly sales volume and changes in product mix 
based upon the composition of our december  backlog and the current competitive pricing environment  we expect full year gross margins to be in a range of to for our explosive metalworking segment 

table of contents the large decrease in oilfield products gross margin relates principally to the sales decline discussed above and resultant less favorable absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses but also includes the impact of non recurring costs associated with the relocation of certain production activities during the second quarter of and year to year changes in product customer mix 
based upon expected improvement in this segment s sequential quarterly sales performance during  we expect oilfield products to report gross margins in the range of to for the full year with gradual improvement in quarter to quarter gross margins if expected sales increases are realized 
the decrease in the amk welding gross margin relates principally to an increase in manufacturing overhead associated with engineering and product development expenses as amk seeks to expand both its service offerings and customer base 
amk welding sales and gross margins for the full year are expected to be comparable to those reported in general and administrative expenses percentage change change general administrative expenses percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  to  in from  in excluding incremental fourth quarter general and administrative expenses of relating to the october  acquisition of lri which included of transaction related expenses  our general and administrative expenses decreased by  or

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations from a combination of internally generated cash flow  revolving credit borrowings  various long term debt arrangements  and the issuance of common stock 
in connection with the acquisition of dynaenergetics  we entered into a five year syndicated credit agreement 
the credit agreement  which provided term loans of  and  euros and revolving credit loan availability of  and  euros  is through a syndicate of seven banks 
on october   the credit agreement was amended to revise the leverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios that we are required to satisfy on a quarterly basis throughout the term of the credit facility  which expires on november  the pricing grid applicable to drawn and undrawn amounts under the credit facility was also amended and will increase our going forward effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings by per annum 
as mentioned above  two significant financial covenants under our credit facility  the leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio requirements  were recently amended to ease the company s ability to comply with these covenants 
the leverage ratio is defined in the credit facility as consolidated funded indebtedness at the balance sheet date as compared to consolidated ebitda  which is defined as earnings before provisions for income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  extraordinary  non recurring charges and other non cash charges  for the previous twelve months 
for the years ended december  and  consolidated ebitda approximated the adjusted ebitda that we reported for the respective periods 
as of december   the maximum leverage ratio permitted by our credit facility was to the actual leverage ratio as of december  was to the maximum leverage ratio permitted as of march  june  september and december  is to  to  to and to  respectively 
the fixed charge ratio  as defined in the credit facility  means  for any period  the ratio of earnings available for fixed charges to fixed charges 
earnings available for fixed charges equals consolidated ebitda plus lease expenses minus cash income taxes and non financed capital expenditures 
fixed charges equals the sum of cash interest expense  lease expense  scheduled principal payments and cash dividends 
as of december   the minimum fixed charge ratio permitted by our credit facility was to the actual fixed charge ratio as of december  was to the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio permitted for the twelve month periods ending march  june  september and december  is to  to  to and to  respectively 
as a result of the slowdown in our business during which has continued into the early part of  our ability to comply with amended financial covenants as of march  and subsequent quarters in could be challenged 
however  we believe that our strong december  cash position combined with our ability to generate additional operating cash flow during will enable us to work successfully with our lenders to further amend the credit facility if the company s ability to comply with current financial covenants comes into question 
in connection with the october  acquisition of lri  we assumed outstanding debt obligations including line of credit loans  loans with the former owners and capital lease obligations in the amounts of   cad    cad and cad  respectively 
as of december   term loans of  and  euros  were outstanding under the credit facility   was outstanding under term loan obligations of dynaenergetics and  was outstanding under loan agreements with the former owners of lri 
we had no outstanding revolving credit borrowings under our syndicated credit agreement or under our separate dynaenergetics line of credit agreements 
we had  outstanding under the line of credit assumed with the acquisition of lri 
while we had approximately  of unutilized revolving credit loan capacity as of december  under our various credit facilities  future borrowings are subject to compliance with financial covenants that could significantly limit availability 
we believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our current credit facilities and any future replacement thereof will be sufficient to fund the working capital  debt service  and capital expenditure requirements of our current business operations for the foreseeable future 
nevertheless  our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations will depend upon our success in executing our strategies 
if we are unable to i realize sales from our backlog  ii secure new customer orders at attractive prices  and iii continue to implement cost effective internal processes  our ability to meet cash requirements through operating activities could be impacted 
furthermore  any restriction on the availability of borrowings under our credit facilities could negatively affect our ability to meet future cash requirements

table of contents critical accounting policies our historical consolidated financial statements and notes to our historical consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that our management make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
however  the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity 
interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us 
in management s opinion  the more significant reporting areas impacted by management s judgments and estimates are revenue recognition  asset impairments  impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks and income taxes 
management s judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources  and actual results could differ from the estimates  as additional information becomes known 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition sales of clad metal products and welding services are generally based upon customer specifications set forth in customer purchase orders and require us to provide certifications relative to metals used  services performed and the results of any non destructive testing that the customer has requested be performed 
all issues of conformity of the product to specifications are resolved before the product is shipped and billed 
products related to the oilfield products segment  which include detonating cords  detonators  bi directional boosters and shaped charges  as well as  seismic related explosives and accessories  are standard in nature 
in all cases  revenue is recognized only when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
for contracts that require multiple shipments  revenue is recorded only for the units included in each individual shipment 
if  as a contract proceeds toward completion  projected total cost on an individual contract indicates a probable loss  the company will account for such anticipated loss 
asset impairments we review our long lived assets to be held and used by us for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in so doing  we estimate the future net cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and their eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of these assets  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
long lived assets to be disposed of  if any  are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
business combinations we account for our business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
we allocate the total cost of the acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values 
as part of this allocation process  we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired 
these determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions regarding multiple  highly subjective variables  including those with respect to future cash flows  discount rates  asset lives  and the use of different valuation models and therefore require considerable judgment 
our estimates and assumptions are based  in part  on the availability of listed market prices or other transparent market data 
these determinations affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain 
effective january  we account for business acquisitions in accordance with new financial accounting standards board fasb guidance which applies prospectively to business acquisitions with a closing date following the effective date 
this new guidance significantly changed the accounting for and reporting of business combination transactions and noncontrolling minority interests in consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of this guidance in did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position including the impact of the acquisition of lri 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets we review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually to assess impairment because it is not amortized 
additionally  we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes in circumstances  many of which are subjective in nature  include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our strategy  a significant decrease in the market value of the asset  and a significant change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset 
we assess impairment by comparing the fair value of an identifiable intangible asset or goodwill with its carrying value 
the determination of fair value involves significant management judgment as described further below 
impairments are expensed when incurred 
specifically  we test for impairment as follows goodwill we test goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit level on at least an annual basis 
a reporting unit is a group of businesses i for which discrete financial information is available and ii that have similar economic characteristics 
we test goodwill for impairment using the following two step approach the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
we estimate fair value using the best information available  including market information and discounted cash flow projections  also referred to as the income approach 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
the projections incorporate our best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales and estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist  and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
in the second step  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had just been acquired in a business combination and as if the purchase price was equivalent to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill 
we then compare that implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss for the excess 
our impairment testing in the fourth quarter of did not result in a determination that any of our goodwill was impaired 
the fair value of the oilfield products reporting unit was million at december  compared to its carrying value of million 
a discount rate of was utilized in the income approach component of the model used to measure fair value 
a future impairment is possible and could occur if i the unit s operating results underperform what we have estimated or ii additional volatility of the capital markets or other factors should cause us to raise the percent discount rate utilized in our discounted cash flow analysis or decrease the multiples utilized in our market based analysis 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our reporting units or using methodologies other than as described above could result in different values for reporting units and could result in an impairment charge 
intangible assets subject to amortization an intangible asset that is subject to amortization is reviewed when impairment indicators are present 
we compare the expected undiscounted future operating cash flows associated with finite lived assets to their respective carrying values to determine if the asset is fully recoverable 
if the expected future operating cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  we estimate the fair value of the asset 
impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and when the carrying value exceeds fair value 
the projected cash flows require several assumptions related to  among other things  relevant market factors  revenue growth  if any  and operating margins 

table of contents impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks the functional currency for our foreign operations is the applicable local currency for each affiliate company 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is the local currency are translated at exchange rates in effect at period end  and the statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rates during the period 
exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars that result in unrealized gains or losses are referred to as translation adjustments 
cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity and are included in other cumulative comprehensive income loss 
transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise 
subsequent changes in exchange rates result in transaction gains and losses  which are reflected in income as unrealized based on period end translations or realized upon settlement of the transactions 
cash flows from our operations in foreign countries are translated at actual exchange rates when known  or at the average rate for the period 
as a result  amounts related to assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows will not agree to changes in the corresponding balances in the consolidated balance sheets 
the effects of exchange rate changes on cash balances held in foreign currencies are reported as a separate line item below cash flows from financing activities 
income taxes we are required to recognize the recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in our financial statements but not our tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on income tax credits and on the temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we routinely evaluate deferred tax assets to determine if they will  more likely than not  be recovered from future projected taxable income  if not  we record an appropriate valuation allowance 
stock based compensation expense we are required to account for stock based compensation under fair value recognition provisions 
the stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the fair value of the company s stock on the date of grant 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no obligations  assets or liabilities other than those appearing or disclosed in our financial statements forming part of this annual report  no trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value  and no relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential earnings volatility that could arise from changes in interest rates 
through the use of interest rate swaps  we aim to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of our assets and liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on interest rate risk management 
foreign currency risk our consolidated financial statements are expressed in us dollars  but a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than us dollars
