this summary is not intended to be exhaustive  nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this report  including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
financial results and trends revenues for were million  a decrease from  in which we reported revenues of million 
this decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in feature phone unit sales in our traditional carrier business  which in turn led to a decrease in the number of games that we sold  and  to a lesser extent  the impact of foreign currency exchange rates  which had a greater positive impact on our revenues compared to our revenues 
the decline in our feature phone revenues was both a result of the global economic slowdown and the continued migration of users from traditional feature phones to more advanced platforms and smartphones  such as apple s iphone  google s android and research in motion s blackberry  which offer enhanced functionality 
we believe that this transition will accelerate in as consumers increasingly upgrade their phones 
as a result  we expect an overall decline in our revenues in from our base carrier business  which we expect will still generate the significant majority of our revenues in for us to succeed in and beyond  we believe that we must increasingly publish mobile games that are widely accepted and commercially successful on the smartphone storefronts  which include apple s app store  google s android market  microsoft s windows marketplace for mobile  palm s app catalog  nokia s ovi store and research in motion s blackberry app world 
although we experienced certain successes on these smartphone storefronts in  particularly with respect to the apple app store  our smartphone revenues did not meet our expectations and represented less than of our revenues for in addition  despite the fact that we expect our revenues to increase in this channel in  we do not expect this increase to fully offset the anticipated decline in revenues from games we develop for feature phones in our traditional base carrier business 
significantly growing our revenues and further succeeding in this channel may be challenging for us for several reasons  including the open nature of many new smartphone storefronts increases substantially the number of our competitors and competitive products  which makes it more difficult for us to achieve prominent placement or featuring for our games  the competitive advantage of our porting capabilities may be reduced as these advanced platforms and smartphones become more widely adopted  many of our key licenses do not grant us the rights to develop games for the iphone and other smartphones  open storefront distribution is still relatively new for us  and we must develop a marketing strategy that allows us to generate sustainable and increasingly profitable revenues  without 
table of contents significantly increasing our marketing or development expenses  the pricing and revenue models for titles on these smartphone storefronts are rapidly evolving  and has resulted  and may continue to result  in significantly lower average selling prices for our games developed for smartphones as compared to games we have developed for feature phones in our traditional carrier channels  and we have a limited ability to invest heavily in this strategy 
in addition  our revenues will continue to depend significantly on growth in the mobile games market  our ability to continue to attract new end users in that market and the overall strength of the economy  particularly in the united states 
our revenues may also be adversely impacted by decisions by our carriers to alter their customer terms for downloading our games 
for example  verizon wireless  our largest carrier  imposes a data surcharge to download content on those verizon customers who have not otherwise subscribed to a data plan 
our revenues depend on a variety of other factors  including our relationships with the feature phone and smartphone storefronts and our licensors 
even if mobile games based on licensed content or brands remain popular with end users  any of our licensors could decide not to renew an existing license or not to license additional intellectual property to us and instead license to our competitors or develop and publish their own mobile games or other applications  competing with us in the marketplace 
the loss of any key relationships with our carriers  other distributors or licensors could impact our revenues in the future 
we expect our revenues to be lower than our revenues  and in future periods  our revenues could continue to decline 
our net loss in was million versus a net loss of million in this decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in operating expenses of million  which includes a reduction in goodwill impairment charges from million recorded in to none in  a decrease in costs of revenues of million  and a decrease in interest and other expense of  which was partially offset by a million reduction in revenues 
the decrease in our operating expense for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  was in part due to the headcount reductions and related measures that we took in connection with the restructurings that we implemented in both the third and fourth quarters of and the third quarter of and the restructuring that we implemented in connection with our acquisition of superscape in march our operating results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of the currencies in which we incur meaningful operating expenses principally the british pound sterling  chinese renminbi  brazilian real and russian ruble and our customers reporting currencies  as we transact business in more than countries in more than different currencies  and in and  some of these currencies fluctuated by up to 
we expect that our expenses to develop and port games for advanced platforms and smartphones will increase as we enhance our existing titles and develop new titles to take advantage of the additional functionality offered by these platforms 
in addition  we expect to incur additional expenses in connection with our efforts to develop games for social networking websites 
our ability to attain profitability will be affected by our ability to grow our revenues and the extent to which we must incur additional expenses to expand our sales  marketing  development  and general and administrative capabilities to grow our business 
the largest component of our recurring expenses is personnel costs  which consist of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation  including bonuses and stock based compensation  for our employees 
we expect that our cash expenses will decline in compared to in terms of absolute dollars as a result of the restructuring measures we implemented in the first quarter of  which primarily consisted of headcount reductions 
our business has historically been impacted by seasonality  as many new mobile handset models are released in the fourth calendar quarter to coincide with the holiday shopping season 
because many end users download our games soon after they purchase new handsets  we generally experience seasonal sales increases based on the holiday selling period 
however  due to the time between handset purchases and game purchases  most of this holiday impact occurs for us in our first calendar quarter 
in addition  we release many of our products in conjunction with specific events  such as the release of a related movie 
further  for a variety of reasons  including roaming charges for data downloads that may make purchase of our games prohibitively expensive for many end users while they are traveling  we sometimes experience seasonal sales decreases during the summer  particularly in parts of europe 
we expect these seasonal trends to continue in the future 
cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million  a decrease of million from million at december  this decrease was primarily due to million in principal that we paid during with respect to the promissory notes that we issued to the former mig shareholders that are discussed in 
table of contents further detail in significant transactions below 
we also used  for capital expenditures 
these outflows were partially offset by the net proceeds of million from borrowings under our credit facility  million of cash generated from operations and proceeds of  from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents  together with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
we currently expect that we will be able to comply with the ebitda related covenants contained in our revolving credit facility 
however  if our revenues are lower than we anticipate  we will be required to further reduce our operating expenses to remain in compliance with these covenants 
reducing our operating expenses could be very challenging for us  since we undertook operating expense reductions and restructuring activities in the third and fourth quarters of  the third quarter of and the first quarter of that reduced our operating expenses significantly from second quarter of levels 
reducing operating expenses further could have the effect of reducing our revenues 
in august  february and march  we entered into amendments to our revolving credit facility with the lender  which reduced certain of the minimum targets contained in the earnings before interest  depreciation and amortization ebitda related covenant  changed the measurement period for the ebitda covenant from a rolling six month calculation to a quarterly calculation  extended the maturity date of the credit facility from december  to june  and increased the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility by to the higher of the lender s prime rate plus  or see liquidity and capital resources sufficiency of current cash and cash equivalents below 
a failure on our part to remain in compliance with the covenants under the revolving credit facility could adversely impact our cash requirements for the next twelve months 
significant transactions in december  we renegotiated and extended our credit facility  and  as discussed above  we have amended the terms of the credit facility in august  february and march the credit facility  as amended  provides for borrowings of up to million  subject to a borrowing base equal to of our eligible accounts receivable 
in march  we acquired superscape  a global publisher of mobile games  to deepen and broaden our game library  gain access to d game development resources and to augment our internal production and publishing resources with a studio in moscow  russia 
we paid pence pound sterling in cash for each issued share of superscape for a total purchase price of million  consisting of cash consideration of million and transaction costs of million 
due to decreases in our long term forecasts and current market capitalization the entire goodwill resulting from the superscape acquisition was impaired during the year ended december  in december  we acquired mig to accelerate our presence in china  deepen our relationship with china mobile  the largest wireless carrier in china  acquire access and rights to leading franchises for the chinese market  and augment our internal production and publishing resources with a studio in china 
we purchased all of mig s then outstanding shares for a total purchase price of million  consisting of cash consideration to mig shareholders of million and transaction costs of million 
as a result of the attainment of the revenue and operating income milestones in by mig  we were committed to pay the million in additional consideration to the mig shareholders and the million of bonuses to two officers of mig 
in december  due to our cash position and liquidity concerns  we restructured the timing and nature of these payments and issued to the former shareholders of mig an aggregate of million in promissory notes 
we repaid million in principal on these notes in and the remainder is due in due to decreases in our long term forecasts and current market capitalization  a portion of the goodwill resulting from the mig acquisition was impaired during the year ended december  in march  we completed our initial public offering  or ipo  in which we sold and issued million shares of common stock at a price of per share to the public 
we raised a total of million in gross proceeds from the ipo  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other offering costs of million 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingencies as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable under the circumstances existing at the time these estimates and judgments are made  actual results may differ from those estimates  which could affect our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following to be critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition or results of operations and they require critical management estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  advance or guaranteed licensor royalty payments  short term investments  business combinations purchase accounting  long lived assets  goodwill  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
revenue recognition we estimate revenues from carriers in the current period when reasonable estimates of these amounts can be made 
several carriers provide reliable interim preliminary reporting and others report sales data within a reasonable time frame following the end of each month  both of which allow us to make reasonable estimates of revenues and therefore to recognize revenues during the reporting period when the end user licenses the game 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable  but it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates 
our estimates for revenues include consideration of factors such as preliminary sales data  carrier specific historical sales trends  the age of games and the expected impact of newly launched games  successful introduction of new handsets  promotions during the period and economic trends 
when we receive the final carrier reports  to the extent not received within a reasonable time frame following the end of each month  we record any differences between estimated revenues and actual revenues in the reporting period when we determine the actual amounts 
historically  the revenues on the final revenue report have not differed by more than one half of of the reported revenues for the period  which we deemed to be immaterial 
revenues earned from certain carriers may not be reasonably estimated 
if we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount of revenue to be recognized in the current period  we recognize revenues upon the receipt of a carrier revenue report and when our portion of a game s licensed revenues is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
to monitor the reliability of our estimates  our management  where possible  reviews the revenues by carrier and by game on a weekly basis to identify unusual trends such as differential adoption rates by carriers or the introduction of new handsets 
if we deem a carrier not to be creditworthy  we defer all revenues from the arrangement with that carrier until we receive payment and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
advance or guaranteed licensor royalty payments our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments  which are payable regardless of the ultimate volume of sales to end users 
in accordance with the criteria set forth in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  guarantees  we recorded a minimum guaranteed liability of approximately million as of december  when no significant performance remains with the licensor  we initially record each of these guarantees as an asset and as a 
table of contents liability at the contractual amount 
we believe that the contractual amount represents the fair value of our liability 
when significant performance remains with the licensor  we record royalty payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred  rather than upon execution of the contract 
we classify minimum royalty payment obligations as current liabilities to the extent they are contractually due within the next twelve months 
each quarter  we also evaluate the realization of our royalties as well as any unrecognized guarantees not yet paid to determine amounts that we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales 
we use estimates of revenues  cash flows and net margins to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties and guarantees 
this evaluation considers multiple factors  including the term of the agreement  forecasted demand  game life cycle status  game development plans and current and anticipated sales levels 
to the extent that this evaluation indicates that the remaining prepaid and guaranteed royalty payments are not recoverable  we record an impairment charge in the period such impairment is indicated 
subsequently  if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  amounts of prepaid royalties previously written down may be utilized  resulting in lower cost of revenues and higher income from operations than previously expected in that period 
during  and  we recorded impairment charges of million  million and zero  respectively 
the impairments we recorded in were predominantly related to distribution agreements in europe  middle east and africa emea and several global properties whose actual and forecasted sales have not met our initial expectations and will not generate sufficient revenues to recoup our royalty commitment 
short term investments in the past  we invested in auction rate securities that are bought and sold in the marketplace through a bidding process sometimes referred to as a dutch auction 
after the initial issuance of the securities  the interest rate on the securities is reset periodically  at intervals set at the time of issuance eg  every seven  or days or every six months  based on the market demand at the reset period 
the stated or contractual maturities for these securities  however  generally are to years 
as of december  and  we had no investments in auction rate securities 
we periodically review our investments for impairment 
in the event the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  we write down the value of the investment to its fair value 
we realized a gain of  for the year ended december  in respect of two securities that had been previously written down to fair value based on two failed auctions  these were redeemed at their respective par values by the sponsoring broker in the fourth quarter of business combinations purchase accounting for acquisitions prior to january   we utilized the purchase method of accounting  which required that we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
we record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing purchased technology  customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets 
if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values  we could experience impairment charges 
see goodwill below 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 
long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable in accordance with asc  property plant equipment asc 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or 
table of contents projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
we recognize impairment based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
fair value is generally measured based on either quoted market prices  if applicable  or a discounted cash flow analysis 
goodwill in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc  we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives but rather test them for impairment 
asc requires us to perform an impairment review of our goodwill balance at least annually  which we do as of september each year  and also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in our impairment reviews  we look at the goodwill allocated to our reporting units the americas  emea and asia pacific apac 
asc requires a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
the first step measures for impairment by applying the fair value based tests at the reporting unit level 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying the fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities within each reporting units 
the fair value of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data  and or the income approach  which uses discounted cash flows 
we have three geographic segments comprised of the americas  apac and emea regions 
as of december   we only had goodwill attributable to the apac reporting unit 
we performed an annual impairment review as of september  as prescribed in asc and concluded that we were not at risk of failing the first step  as the fair value of the apac reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was necessary 
as a result  we were not required to perform the second step 
in order to determine the fair value of the reporting units  we utilized the discounted cash flow and market methods 
we have consistently utilized both methods in our goodwill impairment tests and weight both results equally and we believe both  in conjunction with each other  provide a reasonable estimate of the determination of fair value of the reporting unit the discounted cash flow method being specific to anticipated future results of the reporting unit and the market method  which is based on our market sector including our competitors 
the assumptions supporting the discounted cash flow method  were determined using our best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
in  we recorded an aggregate goodwill impairment of million as the fair values of the americas  apac and emea reporting units were determined to be below their respective carrying values 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of the reporting units  the assigning of assets and liabilities to reporting units  the assigning of goodwill to reporting units and the determining of the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments and assumptions include the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including forecasted revenues and costs based on current titles under contract  forecasted new titles that we expect to release  timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  discount rates and growth rates in terminal values 
the market comparable approach estimates the fair value of a company by applying to that company market multiples of publicly traded firms in similar lines of business 
the use of the market comparable approach requires judgments regarding the comparability of companies with lines of business similar to ours 
this process is particularly difficult in a situation where no domestic public mobile games companies exist 
the factors used in the selection of comparable companies include growth characteristics as measured by revenue or other financial metrics  margin characteristics  product defined markets served  customer defined markets served  the size of a company as measured by financial metrics such as revenue or market capitalization  the competitive position of a company  such as whether it is a market leader in terms of indicators like market share  and company specific issues that suggest appropriateness or inappropriateness of a particular company as a comparable 
further  the total gross value calculated under each method was not materially different  and therefore if the weighting were different we do not believe that this would have significantly impacted our conclusion 
if different comparable companies had been used  the market multiples and resulting estimates of the fair value of our stock would also have been different 

table of contents changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit  which could trigger impairment 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation asc  which supersedes our previous accounting under apb no 
asc requires the recognition of compensation expense using a fair value based method  for costs related to all share based payments including stock options 
asc requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the grant date using an option pricing model 
to value awards granted on or after january   we used the black scholes option pricing model  which requires  among other inputs  an estimate of the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and assumptions as to volatility of our stock over the term of the related options  the expected term of the options  the risk free interest rate and the option forfeiture rate 
we determined the assumptions used in this pricing model at each grant date 
we concluded that it was not practicable to calculate the volatility of our share price since our securities have been publicly traded for a limited period of time 
therefore  we based expected volatility on the historical volatility of a peer group of publicly traded entities 
we determined the expected term of our options based upon historical exercises  post vesting cancellations and the options contractual term 
we based the risk free rate for the expected term of the option on the us treasury constant maturity rate as of the grant date 
we determined the forfeiture rate based upon our historical experience with option cancellations adjusted for unusual or infrequent events 
in  and  we recorded total employee non cash stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively 
in future periods  stock based compensation expense may increase as we issue additional equity based awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 
additionally  asc requires that we recognize compensation expense only for the portion of stock options that are expected to vest 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from that estimated by management  we may be required to record adjustments to stock based compensation expense in future periods 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax benefit provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current income tax benefit provision together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
as of december  and  our valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets was million and million  respectively 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  we would need to make an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset  which would increase income in the period that determination was made 
we account for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with asc  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of the adoption date was  our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we do not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly within the next months 
we have not provided federal income taxes on the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  other than china  because these earnings are intended to be reinvested permanently 
during the fourth quarter of  we 
table of contents changed our assertion such that foreign earnings of one china subsidiary are no longer intended to be indefinitely reinvested 
as a result we analyzed the need to record deferred taxes related to the foreign undistributed earnings 
no deferred tax asset was recognized since we do not believe the deferred tax asset will reverse in the foreseeable future 
there was no significant impact of this change in assertion on the provision for or benefit from income tax 
results of operations the following sections discuss and analyze the changes in the significant line items in our statements of operations for the comparison periods identified 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenues year ended december  in thousands revenues our revenues decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease was due primarily to a decline in feature phone unit sales in our traditional carrier business  which in turn led to a decrease in the number of games that we sold  and a migration of users from feature phones to smartphones where we were unable to capture the same market share as we have in our traditional carrier business 
foreign currency exchange rates also had a greater positive impact on our revenues during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to the diversification of our product portfolio  including the titles resulting from the acquisitions of mig and superscape  no single title represented or more of sales in either or international revenues decreased by million  from million in to million in the decrease in international revenues was primarily a result of decreased unit sales in emea and china  which was partially offset by increased unit sales in latin america 
we expect our revenues to be lower than our revenues as a result of the anticipated acceleration of the slowdown in our base carrier business as consumers increasingly migrate from traditional feature phones to more advanced platforms and smartphones 
although we expect our revenues from games designed for smartphones to increase in  we do not expect this increase to fully offset the anticipated decline in revenues from our traditional base carrier business 
cost of revenues year ended december  in thousands cost of revenues royalties impairment of prepaid royalties and guarantees amortization of intangible assets total cost of revenues revenues gross margin our cost of revenues decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to a million reduction in amortization for titles and content associated with intangible assets acquired from superscape that were fully amortized in the first quarter of and a decrease of  in royalty expense  offset by a  increase associated with the impairment of certain royalty guarantees 
revenues attributable to games based upon branded intellectual property increased as a percentage of revenues from in to in  primarily due to a decrease in sales of games developed by mig and superscape based on their original intellectual property 
the average royalty rate that we paid on games based on licensed intellectual property  excluding royalty impairments  increased from in to in due 
table of contents to increased sales of titles with higher royalty rates 
the impairment of prepaid royalties and guarantees of million in and million in primarily related to large distribution deals in emea and  with respect to the charge  several global properties that have not performed nor do we believe will perform as initially expected 
overall royalties  including impairment of prepaid royalties and guarantees  as a percentage of total revenues increased from in to in research and development expenses year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses percentage of revenues our research and development expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in research and development costs was primarily due to decreases in salaries and benefits of million  a reduction in third party outside services costs for porting and external development of million  a reduction in facility and overhead costs of million due to reduced headcount and a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses of  we decreased our research and development staff from employees in to in  and salaries and benefits decreased as a result 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses declined from in to in research and development expenses included  of stock based compensation expense in and  in we expect spending for research and development activities to be similar to levels  but we intend to shift a substantial portion of these dollars to development activities for smartphones and social networking websites 
sales and marketing expenses year ended december  in thousands sales and marketing expenses percentage of revenues our sales and marketing expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation of million primarily related to the mig stock based compensation earnout being fully expensed  a million decrease in the mig earnout expense due to lower amortization associated with reaching the end of the vesting terms and conditions  a million decrease in salaries and benefits as we reduced our sales and marketing headcount from on september  to on december   a  decrease in marketing promotions and a  decrease in facility and overhead costs due to reduced headcount 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased from in to in sales and marketing expenses included  of stock based compensation expense in and million in we expect our sales and marketing expenses to decline in from levels due primarily to the restructurings we implemented in and the first quarter of general and administrative expenses year ended december  in thousands general and administrative expenses percentage of revenues our general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a million decrease in salaries and benefits  a million decrease in professional and consulting fees  a  decrease in 
table of contents stock based compensation and a  decrease in facility and overhead costs 
we increased our general and administrative headcount from in to in  but salaries and benefits decreased primarily as a result of moving headcount to lower cost locations 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in general and administrative expenses included million of stock based compensation expense in and million in we expect our general and administrative expenses to decline in from levels due primarily to the restructurings we implemented in and the first quarter of other operating expenses our restructuring charges increased from million in to million in the million of restructuring charges in consisted of  of facility related charges   of severance and termination benefits associated with the departure of our former chief executive officer  and  related to employee termination costs in our us and us offices 
the facility charges consisted of  of charges associated with changes in the sublease probability assumption for the vacated office space in our us headquarters and an additional restructuring charge of  net of sublease income  resulting from vacating a portion of our emea headquarters based in the united kingdom 
the million of restructuring charges in consisted of  related to employee severance and benefit arrangements due to the termination of employees in france  hong kong  sweden  the united kingdom and the united states and  related to vacated office space at our united states headquarters 
our impairment of goodwill decreased from million in to zero in the analysis of our goodwill balance in caused us to conclude that all million of the goodwill attributed to the emea reporting unit was impaired  as was all of the million of goodwill attributed to the americas reporting unit and million of the million of goodwill attributed to the apac reporting unit 
as a result  a non cash goodwill impairment charge to operations totaling million was recorded in no goodwill impairment charge was recorded related to our apac reporting unit in as the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of its goodwill 
the fair value was determined using an estimate of forecasted discounted cash flows and our market capitalization 
we have million of goodwill remaining as of december   which is allocated to the apac reporting unit 
our in process research and development ipr d charge was million in  there was no charge in the ipr d charge recorded in related to the in process development of new d and d games by superscape at the date of acquisition 
other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  decreased from a net expense of million in to a net expense of million in this change was primarily due to an increase of million in interest expense related to the mig notes and borrowings under our credit facility  a decrease in interest income of  resulting from lower cash balances as a result of the mig and superscape acquisitions  which was offset by a million decrease in other expense 
this change in other expense was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency gains of million related to the revaluation of certain assets and liabilities  offset by a net decrease of  associated with lower mark to market gains on disposal of long term investments in income tax benefit provision income tax provision decreased from million in to million in as a result of taxable profits in certain foreign jurisdictions  changes in the valuation allowance and increased foreign withholding taxes resulting from increased sales in countries with withholding tax requirements 
the provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory us federal rate principally due to the effect of our non us operations  non deductible stock based compensation expense  an increase in the valuation allowance and increased foreign withholding taxes 
our effective income tax benefit rate for the year ended december  was compared to in the prior year 
the higher effective benefit tax rate in was mainly attributable 
table of contents to a decrease in pre tax losses  changes in withholding taxes  dividends and non deductible stock based compensation 
our effective income tax rates for and future periods will depend on a variety of factors  including changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance  as well as changes in our business such as from intercompany transactions and any acquisitions  any changes in our international structure  any changes in the geographic location of our business functions or assets  changes in the geographic mix of our income  any changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities  changes in applicable accounting rules  applicable tax laws and regulations  rulings and interpretations thereof  developments in tax audit and other matters  and variations in our annual pre tax income or loss 
we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our pre tax consolidated income or loss 
as a result  in absolute dollar terms  our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pre tax income or loss than at higher levels 
in addition  at lower levels of pre tax income or loss  our effective tax rate will be more volatile 
one of our subsidiaries in china has received approval as a high new technology enterprise qualification from the ministry of science and technology  and also a software enterprise qualification from the ministry of industry and information technology 
these qualifications provide preferential income tax treatment which will be effective upon the approval of our application with the state administration of taxation to apply the favorable tax benefits to operations beginning as of january  in the event that the state administration for taxation approves our application  certain taxes that were expensed in could be refunded and certain deferred tax assets and liabilities will be revalued

our acquired in process research and development increased from million related to the mig acquisition in to million related to the superscape acquisition in the ipr d charges recorded in and were related to the development of new games 
we determined the value of acquired ipr d from superscape using a discounted cash flows approach 
we calculated the present value of expected future cash flows attributable to the in process technology using a discount rate 
this rate took into account the percentage of completion of the development effort ranging from approximately to and the risks associated with our developing technology given changes in trends and technology in our industry 
as of december   all acquired ipr d projects had been completed at a cost similar to the original projections

table of contents foreign withholding taxes resulting from increased sales in countries with withholding tax requirements 
the provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory us federal rate principally due to the effect of our non us operations  non deductible stock based compensation expense  an increase in the valuation allowance  increased foreign withholding taxes  and a non deductible goodwill impairment charge 
our effective income tax benefit rate for the year ended december  was compared to an effective income tax expense rate of in the prior year

operating activities in  net cash provided by operating activities was million as compared to million in net cash used in operating activities in this increase was primarily due to a decrease in prepaid royalties of million  which was caused primarily by the impairment of certain titles during  and a decrease in accounts receivable of million due to declining sales in our carrier business 
in addition  we had adjustments for non cash items  including amortization expense of million  impairment of prepaid royalties and guarantees of million  stock based compensation expense of million  depreciation expense of million  interest expense on debt of million and mig earnout expense of  these amounts were partially offset by a net loss of million  a decrease in accrued royalties of million  a decrease in long term liabilities of million due to reclassification of the mig earnout from long term to short term liabilities  a decrease in accounts payable of million due to lower operating costs and improvements in processing of payments and a non cash foreign currency translation gain of  in  we used million of net cash in operating activities as compared to million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in our net loss by million  increases in prepaid royalties of million for new license arrangements  payments for restructuring activities of million  a decrease in our accounts payable of million and payments for prepaid and other assets of million

investing activities our primary investing activities have consisted of purchases and sales of short term investments  purchases of property and equipment and  in and  the acquisitions of superscape and mig  respectively 
we may use more cash in investing activities in for property and equipment related to supporting our infrastructure and our development and design studios 
we expect to fund these investments with our existing cash and cash equivalents and our revolving credit facility 
in  we used  of cash for investing activities resulting primarily from purchases of computer and networking equipment  software equipment and leasehold improvements

financing activities in  net cash used in financing activities was million due to the payment of million in principal amount related to the mig notes  which was partially offset by the net proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility of million and proceeds from option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of in  we generated million of net cash from financing activities resulting from net proceeds from exercises of common stock of million and net proceeds from exercises of stock warrants of million 
in  we generated million of net cash from financing activities  substantially all of which came from the net proceeds of our ipo of million  partially offset by the repayment of a loan from pinnacle ventures of million 
sufficiency of current cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  during the year ended december   we used million of cash 
we expect to continue to fund our operations and satisfy our contractual obligations for primarily through our cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and any cash generated by operations 
however  there can be no assurances that we will be able to generate positive operating cash flow during or beyond 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents  together with any cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
however  our cash requirements for the next months may be greater than we anticipate due to  among other reasons  lower than expected cash generated from operating activities including the impact of foreign currency rate changes  revenues that are lower than we currently anticipate  greater than expected operating expenses  usage of cash to fund our foreign operations  unanticipated limitations or timing restrictions on our ability to access funds that are held in our non us subsidiaries  a deterioration of the quality of our accounts receivable  which could lower the borrowing base under our credit facility  and any failure on our part to remain in compliance with the covenants under our revolving credit facility 
our expectations regarding cash sufficiency assume that our operating results will be sufficient to enable us to comply with our credit facility s ebitda related covenant discussed below 
if our revenues are lower than we anticipate  we might be required to reduce our operating expenses to remain in compliance with this financial covenant 
reducing our operating expenses could be very challenging for us  since we undertook operating expense reductions and restructuring activities in the third and fourth quarters of  the third quarter of and the first quarter of that reduced our operating expenses significantly from second quarter of levels 
reducing operating expenses further could have the effect of reducing our revenues 
our cash needs include our requirement to repay million of principal under the mig notes as of december   which is payable in from our domestic entities  as well as million of principal under promissory notes issued to two former shareholders of mig which is payable in from our chinese entities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for more information regarding our debt 
our anticipated cash requirements during also include payments for prepaid royalties and guarantees  of which a portion is related to anticipated new license agreements for which there are no existing contractual commitments  which amount we may elect to reduce if we require more working capital than we currently anticipate 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for more information regarding our contractual commitments 
however  this reduced spending on new licenses and 
table of contents any additional reduction in spending may adversely impact our title plan for and beyond  and accordingly our ability to generate revenues in future periods 
conversely  if cash available to us is greater than we currently anticipate  we may elect to increase prepaid royalties above currently anticipated levels if we believe it will contribute to enhanced revenue growth and profitability 
we currently have an million credit facility  which expires on june  our credit facility contains financial covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to draw down the entire million 
these covenants are as follows ebitda 
on august   we entered into an amendment to our credit facility  which reduced certain of the minimum targets contained in the ebitda related covenant 
on february  we entered into a second amendment to the agreement 
the second amendment changed the measurement period for the ebitda covenant from a rolling six month calculation to a quarterly calculation 
on march   we entered into a third amendment to the agreement which extended the maturity date of the credit facility from december  until june   increased the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility by to the lender s prime rate  plus  but no less than  and requires us to maintain  measured on a consolidated basis at the end of each of the following periods  ebitda of at least the following july  through december  january  through march  april  through june  july  through september  october  through december  january  through march  april  through june  we currently believe that we will be able to comply with the minimum ebitda targets set forth above 
for purposes of the above covenant  ebitda means a our consolidated net income  determined in accordance with us gaap  plus b interest expense  plus c to the extent deducted in the calculation of net income  depreciation expense and amortization expense  plus d income tax expense  plus e non cash stock compensation expense  plus f non cash goodwill and other intangible assets and royalty impairments  plus g non cash foreign exchange translation charges  minus h all of our non cash income and the non cash income of our subsidiaries for such period 
minimum domestic liquidity we must maintain at the lender an amount of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of not less than the greater of a of our total consolidated unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  or b of outstanding obligations under the credit facility 
the credit facility also includes a material adverse change clause 
as a result  if a material adverse change occurs with respect to our business  operations or financial condition  then that change could constitute an event of default under the terms of our credit facility 
when an event of default occurs  the lender can  among other things  declare all obligations immediately due and payable  could stop advancing money or extending credit under the credit facility and could terminate the credit facility 
we believe that the risk of a material adverse change occurring with respect to our business  operations or financial condition and the lender requesting immediate repayment of amounts already borrowed  stopping advancing the remaining credit or terminating the credit facility is remote 
our credit facility is collateralized by eligible customer accounts receivable balances  as defined by the lender 
there can be no assurances that our eligible accounts receivable balances will be adequate to allow us to draw down on the entire million credit facility particularly if any of our larger customers creditworthiness deteriorates 
at our current revenue levels  we are not able to access the full million of the credit facility 
in addition  among other things  the credit facility limits our ability to dispose of certain assets  make acquisitions  incur additional indebtedness  incur liens  pay dividends and make other distributions  and make investments 
further  the credit facility requires us to maintain a separate account with the lender for collection of our accounts receivables 
all deposits into this account will be automatically applied by the lender to our outstanding obligations under the credit facility 

table of contents as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under our credit facility  which is classified as a current liability on the december  balance sheet 
subsequent to year end  the maturity date of the credit facility was extended to june  our failure to comply with the financial or operating covenants in the credit facility would not only prohibit us from borrowing under the facility  but would also constitute a default  permitting the lender to  among other things  declare any outstanding borrowings  including all accrued interest and unpaid fees  immediately due and payable 
a change in control of glu also constitutes an event of default  permitting the lender to accelerate the indebtedness and terminate the credit facility 
the credit facility also contains other customary events of default 
to the extent an event of default occurred under the credit facility and the lender accelerated the indebtedness and terminated the credit facility  this would also trigger the cross default provisions of the mig notes 
utilizing our credit facility results in debt payments that bear interest at the lender s prime rate plus  but no less than  which adversely impacts our cash position and result in operating and financial covenants that restrict our operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for more information regarding our debt 
the credit facility matures on june   when all amounts outstanding will be due 
if the credit facility is terminated prior to maturity by us or by the lender after the occurrence and continuance of an event of default  then we will owe a termination fee equal to  or of the total commitment 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
of the million of cash and cash equivalents that we held at december   approximately million were held in accounts in china 
to fund our operations and repay our debt obligations  we repatriated approximately million of available funds from china to the united states during  which was subject to withholding taxes of 
we intend to pay million of principal under promissory notes issued to two former shareholders of mig which is payable in from our chinese entities 
in addition  given the current global economic environment and other potential developments outside of our control  we may be unable to utilize the funds that we hold in all of our non us accounts  which funds include cash and marketable securities  since the funds may be frozen by additional international regulatory actions  the accounts may become illiquid for an indeterminate period of time or there may be other such circumstances that we are unable to predict 
in addition  we may require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue  and to defend against  settle or pay damages related to a litigation dispute to which we are currently a party 
we also intend to enter into new licensing arrangements for existing or new licensed intellectual properties  which may require us to make royalty payments at the outset of the agreements well before we are able to collect cash payments and or recognize revenues associated with the licensed intellectual properties 
if our cash sources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  we may seek to raise additional capital by selling convertible debt or equity securities  seeking to increase the amount available to us for borrowing under our credit facility or selling some of our assets  or we may seek to restructure our obligations under the mig notes 
we may be unable to raise additional capital through the sale of securities  or to do so on terms that are favorable to us  particularly given current capital market and overall economic conditions 
any sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
the holders of new securities may also receive rights  preferences or privileges that are senior to those of existing holders of our common stock  all of which is subject to the provisions of the credit facility 
additionally  we may be unable to increase the size of our credit facility  or to do so on terms that are acceptable to us  particularly in light of the current credit market conditions 
we may also be unable to restructure our obligations under the mig notes to the extent we may need 
if the amount of cash that we generate from operations is less than anticipated  or if we use cash in our operations  we could also be required to extend the term of our credit facility beyond its june  expiration date or replace it with an alternate loan arrangement  and resulting debt payments thereunder could further inhibit our ability to achieve profitability in the future 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than total year years years thereafter in thousands operating lease obligations  net of sublease income guaranteed royalties mig earnout and bonus notes line of credit uncertain tax obligations  including interest and penalties we have entered into license and development arrangements with various owners of brands and other intellectual property so that we can create and publish games for mobile handsets based on that intellectual property 
a significant portion of these agreements require us to pay guaranteed royalties over the term of the contracts regardless of actual game sales 
some of these minimum payments totaling million have been recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet because payment is not contingent upon performance by the licensor 
we have issued million of notes payable to former shareholders of mig  of which we had paid an aggregate principal amount of million as of december  the amounts in the table above include interest accrued through december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for more information regarding our debt 
in march  we signed a third amendment to the credit facility which extended the maturity date of the credit facility from december  until june   when all amounts outstanding will be due 
as of december   the above amount has been classified within current liabilities 
as of december   unrecognized tax benefits and potential interest and penalties are classified within other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 
it updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under asc  which originated primarily from the guidance in eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting  and eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration 
in addition  the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
asu will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted provided that the revised guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption 
the adoption of this standard update is not expected to impact our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued update no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu which amended the accounting 
table of contents requirements under the software topic  asc revenue recognition 
the objective of this update is to address the accounting for revenue arrangements that contain tangible products and software 
specifically  products that contain software that is more than incidental to the product as a whole will be removed from the scope of asc subtopic previously aicpa statement of position 
the amendments align the accounting for these revenue transaction types with the amendments under asu mentioned above 
the guidance provided within asu is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  and allows for either prospective or retrospective application  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this standard update is not expected to impact our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued update no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic measuring liabilities at fair value asu 
asu amends asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  of the codification to provide further guidance on how to measure the fair value of a liability 
it primarily does three things sets forth the types of valuation techniques to be used to value a liability when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability and clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are level fair value measurements 
this standard became effective in the fourth quarter of the adoption of this standard update did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
effective july   we adopted asc  generally accepted accounting principles asc the codification 
asc establishes the exclusive authoritative reference for us gaap for use in financial statements  except for sec rules and interpretive releases  which are also authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification will supersede all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
we have included the references to the codification  as appropriate  in these consolidated financial statements 
as the codification was not intended to change or alter existing gaap  it did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective april   we adopted asc  subsequent events asc 
the standard modifies the names of the two types of subsequent events either as recognized subsequent events previously referred to in practice as type i subsequent events or non recognized subsequent events previously referred to in practice as type ii subsequent events 
in addition  the standard modifies the definition of subsequent events to refer to events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date  but before the financial statements are issued for public entities or available to be issued for nonpublic entities 
it also requires the disclosure of the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
the adoption of this standard did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective april   we adopted three accounting standard updates which were intended to provide additional application guidance and enhanced disclosures regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities 
they also provide additional guidelines for estimating fair value in accordance with fair value accounting 
the first update  as codified in asc  provides additional guidelines for estimating fair value in accordance with fair value accounting 
the second accounting update  as codified in asc  changes accounting requirements for other than temporary impairment otti for debt securities by replacing the current requirement that a holder have the positive intent and ability to hold an impaired security to recovery in order to conclude an impairment was temporary with a requirement that an entity conclude it does not intend to sell an impaired security and it will not be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
the third accounting update  as codified in asc  increases the frequency of fair value disclosures 
these updates were effective for fiscal years and interim periods ended after june  the adoption of these accounting updates did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard update regarding business combinations  asc  which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
asc also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the 
table of contents business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
asc applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  although we did not enter into any business combinations during  we believe asc may have a material impact on our future consolidated financial statements if we were to enter into any future business combinations depending on the size and nature of any such future transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and credit risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our interest payable under our million credit facility and potential increases in our interest payments arising from increases in interest rates and our investment portfolio and the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect interest payments under our million credit facility 
advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to our credit facility lender s prime rate  plus  but no less than 
consequently  our interest expense will fluctuate with changes in the general level of interest rates 
at december   we had million outstanding under the credit facility and our effective interest rate at that time was approximately 
we believe that a change in the lender s prime rate would have a significant impact on our interest expense  results of operations and liquidity 
we are also potentially exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect interest earned on our investment portfolio 
as of december   we had no short term investments and substantially all million of our cash and cash equivalents was held in operating bank accounts earning nominal interest 
accordingly  we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income  operating results or liquidity related to these amounts 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are  in order of importance  to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
we do not currently use or plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
in addition  during and we held auction rate securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources investing activities  in item of this report  and risk factors in item a of this report for a description of market events that affected the liquidity and fair value of these securities 
as of december   we held no auction rate securities 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are  in order of importance  to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
we do not currently use or plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
as of december  and december   our cash and cash equivalents were maintained by financial institutions in the united states  the united kingdom  australia  brazil  chile  china  columbia  france  germany  hong kong  italy  russia and spain  and our current deposits are likely in excess of insured limits 
our accounts receivable primarily relate to revenues earned from domestic and international wireless carriers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our carriers financial condition but generally require no collateral from them 
as of december  and december   verizon wireless accounted for and of our total accounts receivable  respectively  and no other carrier represented more than of our total accounts receivable as of these dates 
foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in more than countries in more than different currencies  and in and  some of these currencies fluctuated by up to 
our revenues are usually denominated in the functional currency of the carrier while the operating expenses of our operations outside of the united states are maintained in their local currency  with the significant operating currencies consisting of british pound sterling gbp  chinese 
table of contents renminbi  brazilian real and russian ruble 
although recording operating expenses in the local currency of our foreign operations mitigates some of the exposure of foreign currency fluctuations  variances among the currencies of our customers and our foreign operations relative to the united states dollar usd could have and have had a material impact on our results of operations 
our foreign currency exchange gains and losses have been generated primarily from fluctuations in gbp versus the usd and in the euro versus gbp 
at month end  foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and intercompany balances are marked to market and unrealized gains and losses are included in other income expense  net 
translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
we have in the past experienced  and in the future may experience  foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our accounts receivable and intercompany receivables and payables 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
there is also additional risk if the currency is not freely or actively traded 
some currencies  such as the chinese renminbi  in which our chinese operations principally transact business  are subject to limitations on conversion into other currencies  which can limit out ability to react to foreign currency devaluations 
to date  we have not engaged in exchange rate hedging activities and we do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we might not be able to offset these higher costs fully through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  operating results and financial condition
