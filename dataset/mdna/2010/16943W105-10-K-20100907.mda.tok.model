overview we  through our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries  jinong  jintai and yuxing  are engaged in the following businesses i research  development  production  distribution and sale of humic acid based compound fertilizer  and ii development  production and sale of agricultural products  namely  top grade fruits  vegetables  flowers and colored seedlings 
jintai and yuxing also serve as a research and development base for our fertilizer products 
the fertilizer business conducted through jinong has been our main business  generating approximately and of our total revenues in the fiscal year ended june  and  respectively 
we employ a multi tiered product strategy in which we tailor our products to the requirements and preferences of the different geographic regions across china 
the vast land area of china produces varying characteristics including climate and soil conditions  which require specific fertilizers to have productive crop yields 
as of june   we developed and produced different fertilizer products and sold approximately  and  metric tons of fertilizer products for the years ended june  and  respectively 
our sales of fertilizer products to five provinces accounted for approximately of our fertilizer revenue for the fiscal year ended june  specifically  the provinces and their respective percentage contribution to our fertilizer revenues were shandong  shaanxi  anhui  heilongjiang and henan we sell our fertilizers products through a large number of distributors covering provinces  autonomous regions and central government controlled municipalities in china 
as of june   we had approximately distributors in china 
we are not dependent on any one or group of distributors 
the top five distributors accounted for only of our fertilizer revenues for the fiscal year ended june  in addition  we export our humic acid based compound fertilizer to contracted distributors in foreign countries  including india  ecuador  pakistan and lebanon 
however  the total revenues from exported products currently account for less than of our fertilizer revenues 
through jintai  we develop  produce and sell high quality flowers  green vegetables and fruits to local marketplaces and various horticulture and planting companies 
we also use jintai s greenhouse facilities to conduct research and development activities for our fertilizer products 
the five prc provinces  which accounted for of our agriculture product revenue for the fiscal year ended june   were shaanxi  shanxi  sichuan  henan and gansu 
jintai s top five customers accounted for of jintai s sales for the fiscal year ended june  recent developments during the three months ended june   we launched nine new humic acid based liquid fertilizer products  including five tailored fertilizers  three functional fertilizers and one broad spectrum fertilizer 
these new products generated approximately  or of our fertilizer revenues for the three months ended june  we also added new distributors during the three months ended june  these new distributors accounted for approximately  or of our fertilizer revenues for the three months ended june  in an effort to achieve full utilization of jinong s annual production capacity of  tons during the next three years while further expanding brand awareness of jinong products  we have successfully implemented two marketing programs in shaanxi  hebei  anhui  jiangsu and guangzhou provinces 
as we have previously announced  these marketing programs consist of the i establishment company directly owned retail stores to sell jinong branded fertilizer products through the company s designated sales personnel the pilot program and ii selection of qualified retailers from the company s distributor base of retail customer to be designated china green agriculture authorized retailers 
under the pilot program  we currently have directly owned stores operating in shaanxi province  with each store having an assigned territory in order not to compete with any of the company s existing distributors 
since the launch of the pilot program in january  we have worked closely with our existing distributors to designate over retailers as china green agriculture retailer 
we have entered into agreements with these retailers to prominently display china green agriculture authorized retailer on their exhibits  and have well positioned standardized shelf and product displays in their retail stores 
in addition  we provide the retailers with educational materials on proper product use  the placement of our branded commercial ads on their delivery trucks and billboard ads with our product logo and tagline to target farmers 
in june  in connection with the construction of yuxing s research and development center on  square meters approximately million square feet land  we completed phase i of the project of building sunlight greenhouses 
in july  we completed seedling cultivation and expect to finish seedling transplantation for these sunlight greenhouses by october and estimate a small contribution to our total revenue in fiscal year from the sales of the agricultural products produced by yuxing 
the new research and development center will further increase the company s ability to introduce new customized  high margin fertilizer products as well as expand its production of cultivated agricultural products which are currently sold to the local marketplace 
phase ii of the project  which includes the construction of intelligent greenhouses  is expected to be completed by the end of december on july   we acquired gufeng  and its wholly owned subsidiary  tianjuyuan  by purchasing all of the outstanding equity interests of gufeng for a purchase price of rmb million approximately million in cash plus an aggregate of  newly issued shares the shares of common stock of the company to gufeng shareholders or their designees 
the value of the shares equaled rmb million approximately million  using the exchange rate of the middle price of us dollar against the rmb on the issuing day of the shares and the per share value of the average price of the closing price of the company s common stock for ten consecutive trading days immediately before the date of execution of share transfer contract with the gufeng shareholders

for the three months ended march  and  gufeng had net sales of  and  gross profit of  and  and net income of  and  respectively
