item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview we develop  manufacture and market string ribbon solar panels utilizing our proprietary wafer manufacturing technology 
our technology involves a unique process to produce multi crystalline silicon wafers by growing thin strips of silicon that are then cut into wafers 
this process substantially reduces the amount of silicon and other processing costs required to produce a wafer when compared to conventional sawing processes 
silicon is the key raw material in manufacturing multi crystalline silicon wafers 
with current silicon consumption of about grams per watt  we believe we are the industry leader in efficient silicon consumption and use approximately half the silicon used by wafer manufacturers utilizing conventional sawing processes 
the wafers we produce are the primary components of photovoltaic pv cells which  in turn  are used to produce solar panels 
we believe that our proprietary and patented technologies offer significant cost and manufacturing advantages over competing silicon based wafer manufacturing technologies 
our revenues today are primarily derived from the sale of solar panels 
we sell our products using distributors  systems integrators and other value added resellers  who often add value through system design by incorporating our panels with electronics  structures and wiring systems 
applications for our products primarily include on grid generation  in which supplemental electricity is provided to an electric utility grid 
our products are currently sold to customers primarily in europe and the united states 
as of december   we had approximately megawatts mw of backlog remaining under our existing long term contracts with deliveries scheduled through our sales contracts allow for our customers to request price changes based upon current market conditions  and we may have to amend contracts for volumes or pricing  as we did during  in order to remain competitive in the marketplace in the future 
our wafer manufacturing technology is proven 
large scale commercial application of our technology  using furnaces that grow two thin strips of multi crystalline silicon  began in with the opening of sovello ag formally everq gmbh  our joint venture with renewable energy corporation asa rec and q cells se q cells 
since its opening  sovello has produced and shipped over mw of product using our wafer technology 
through on going research and design efforts and process changes  we continuously improve our wafer manufacturing technology and our ability to manufacture multi crystalline silicon wafers 
our manufacturing facility in devens  massachusetts uses our quad wafer furnace equipment  which grows four thin strips of multi crystalline silicon from one furnace and incorporates a state of the art automated laser cutting technology that further improves our wafer manufacturing process 
to date  we have produced and shipped approximately mw of product from our devens facility 
our devens facility has continuously met its key operation goals of rapid sequential production increases and significantly reduced manufacturing costs since opening in mid our wafer cost at devens for the fourth quarter was about per watt which we believe is among the lowest in the industry  even at the relatively small volumes currently produced at our devens facility and silicon cost at about per kilogram  proving our competitive advantage in wafer manufacturing 
our total panel cost was about per watt in the fourth quarter  down from in the first quarter of the year 
however  solar panel prices have fallen precipitously since mid making it very difficult for manufacturers located in high cost regions to remain price competitive 
therefore  we are accelerating our strategic initiative of focusing on our unique wafer manufacturing technology and will begin to transition our devens based panel assembly to china beginning later in we expect that by moving panel assembly to china we will be able to substantially reduce manufacturing costs 
we expect the transition of panel assembly to china will take approximately to months to complete  and that panel production  whether produced at devens or in china using cells produced at devens  will be at least mw each quarter 
after the transition is complete we will continue to produce wafers and cells at devens and may increase capacity if market demand warrants 
if long term demand for panels manufactured in the us significantly increases  we will be well positioned to quickly reintroduce panel assembly at devens 
we estimate we will incur non cash 
table of contents charges of approximately million associated with the accelerated depreciation of panel assembly equipment  which is expected to be recognized ratably through mid beginning with the fourth quarter of and cash charges  principally compensation costs of about million in as part of our strategy of long term growth and focusing on our core wafer manufacturing technology  on july   we announced that we had finalized agreements with jiawei solarchina co  ltd  and hubei science technology investment co  ltd  an investment fund sponsored by the government of hubei  china hstic to expand our manufacturing operations into china 
under these agreements we will manufacture string ribbon wafers using our state of the art quad furnaces at a leased facility being built by jiawei in wuhan  china on jiawei s campus 
jiawei will convert the string ribbon wafers into evergreen solar branded panels on a contract manufacturing basis 
we will reimburse jiawei for its cell and panel conversion costs  plus a contract manufacturing fee 
the actual price paid to jiawei will be negotiated annually 
evergreen solar has invested million in cash and equipment in the wuhan wafer manufacturing operation to date 
hstic has provided us million of financing  which we must repay no later than july jiawei will make a similar investment for its cell and panel operations with the support of hstic 
initial capacity is expected to be approximately mw 
factory construction has begun and the parties expect that wafer  cell and panel production will begin in mid the parties intend to expand production capacity of their respective manufacturing operations to approximately mw by  the timing and extent of any potential expansion will be determined in total cost estimated for the initial mw wafer manufacturing facility is expected to be approximately to million  the majority of which is for quad wafer furnaces 
as the first phase of our investment in china reaches to mw of capacity per quarter in early  we expect to initially produce a wafer for about per watt  and with jiawei s low cost cell and panel manufacturing capabilities  a panel for about per watt 
as we continue to advance the technology  make improvements in factory operations and add scale  we expect that we will be producing evergreen branded solar panels for no more than per watt by the end of  including an all in wafer cost of about per watt 
on december   as part of ongoing efforts to lower overhead costs and reduce overall cash requirements  we committed to a plan to cease operations at our pilot manufacturing facility in marlboro  massachusetts 
production at the facility ceased on december  as a result of the cessation of manufacturing in marlboro  during we recorded restructuring costs  principally non cash charges  of approximately million associated with the write off of manufacturing and development equipment  inventory and leasehold improvements of the marlboro pilot facility 
as exhibited by devens financial performance in  closing the marlboro pilot manufacturing facility and better utilizing existing equipment and facilities at our research and development center and at our devens manufacturing facility has resulted in lower overhead costs and reduced overall cash requirements 
at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  which includes approximately million received from hstic as part of its funding obligation for our wuhan  china factory expansion 
through  our major cash requirements are expected to be approximately million  comprised of capital required for our wuhan  china expansion of about million  final acceptance payments on equipment for devens of about million  
table of contents first phase of our midland filament factory of about million  sustaining capital of about million  estimated payments for sovello matters of about million  and debt service of about million 
we have sales contracts for approximately mw of product to be manufactured at our devens facility for delivery during our sales plan assumes there should be sufficient market demand to sell the expected devens manufacturing capacity at continually declining selling prices 
we will moderate our production levels depending on changes in market demands during the year 
we believe that our business plan will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our planned capital programs  our share of any potential funding requirements related to our investment in sovello and our operating needs for at least the next months 
while our business plan anticipates certain levels of potential risk  particularly in light of the difficult and uncertain current economic environment and the continuing reduction of industry panel pricing caused by expanding competition  especially from china  and the possible excess capacity  we are exposed to additional particular risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to the need to maintain the devens facility at a minimum of capacity  or mw per quarter  and stabilization of panel pricing at about per watt  with sales made to creditworthy customers  higher than planned manufacturing costs and failing to achieve expected devens operating metrics  with any delays in our plan to transition panel assembly to china resulting in continued higher costs that could impair business operations  continued significant fluctuation of the euro against the us dollar  as a substantial portion of the contracted sales are denominated in euros  the ability of jiawei to execute against its plans to meet our required timetables  and increased funding requirements for sovello to potentially address the loss of any prior or expected government grant funding for sovello see note of our consolidated financial statements 
although our current business plan indicates we have adequate liquidity to operate under expected operating conditions  the risks noted above could result in liquidity uncertainty 
our plan with regard to this uncertainty includes  among other actions continually monitoring our operating results against expectations and  if required  further restricting operating costs and capital spending if events warrant  if conditions allow  possibly accessing the capital markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements  and negotiating with a number of banks to secure a borrowing base line of credit  without a minimum cash requirement as was required under our previous line of credit  supported by the expected significant increase in our accounts receivable  inventory and overall working capital and possibly hedging a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in the us dollar euro exchange rate to limit any adverse impacts  but there can be no assurance that hedges can be put in place at terms acceptable to us or that such hedging activities will be effective 

table of contents if additional capital is needed and does not become available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund operations  further develop and expand our manufacturing operations and distribution network or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if applicable 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for sovello ag we own a one third interest in sovello ag sovello and therefore apply the equity method of accounting for our share of sovello s operating results in accordance with the investments topic of the fasb codification 
under the equity method of accounting  we report our one third share of sovello s net income or loss as a single line item in our statement of operations see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information 
our investment in and advances to sovello are reported as a single line item in our balance sheet 
we regularly monitor the performance of sovello and  utilizing several factors  assess the need to record an impairment of the carrying value of our aggregate investment when the impairment is determined to be other than temporary in nature 
the process of assessing whether our investment s net realizable value is less than its carrying cost requires a significant amount of judgment 
in making this judgment  we carefully consider sovello s cash position  projected cash flows  financing needs  comparable market data  the current investing environment  management changes and competition 
based on our evaluation  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to our aggregate investment in sovello during the year ended december  as a result of the deterioration in sovello s operations  their difficulties in renegotiating their bank financing  and on going deterioration in world wide pricing for their products 
in making this assessment  we considered a range of scenarios including sovello s ability to continue as a going concern  future projections of volumes and selling prices  and enterprise value multiples of comparable entities 
until december   we marketed and sold all solar panels manufactured by sovello under the evergreen solar brand  and managed customer relationships and contracts related to the sale of sovello manufactured product 
we received selling fees from sovello and did not report gross revenue or cost of goods sold resulting from the sale of sovello s solar panels 
in addition  we receive royalty payments for our ongoing technology license to sovello 
combined  the sales and marketing fee and royalties earned totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for  we  q cells and rec  our one third partners in the sovello joint venture  agreed to have sovello begin marketing and selling its products 
table of contents under its own brand 
with its independent sales and marketing team now in place  our involvement in marketing and selling sovello product will cease 
in light of the sales transition  our selling fee for sovello product sold under the evergreen solar brand was reduced to for from in and is expected to be eliminated for for the years ended december   and  we recorded approximately million   and  respectively  for reimbursement of research and development costs  and other support costs from sovello 
income statement classification of the research and development reimbursement payments depends on how we are reimbursed 
the best efforts arrangement we maintain with sovello allows for the reimbursement to offset expenses whereas a specific performance arrangement would require us to record both revenue and an offsetting cost of revenue 
these reimbursements are therefore shown as a reduction of our expenses 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize product revenue if there is persuasive evidence of an agreement with the customer  shipment has occurred  risk of loss has transferred to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the market for solar power products is emerging and rapidly evolving 
we currently sell our solar power products primarily to distributors  system integrators and other value added resellers within and outside of north america  who typically resell our products to end users throughout the world 
we have not offered rights to return our products other than for normal warranty conditions 
for new customers requesting credit  we evaluate creditworthiness based on credit applications  feedback from provided references  and credit reports from independent agencies 
however  many of our new customers are start up companies and do not have long credit histories 
for existing customers  we evaluate creditworthiness based on payment history and any known changes in their financial condition 
royalty and fee revenue are recognized at contractual rates upon shipment of product by sovello 
product revenues represented  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
international product sales accounted for approximately  and of total product revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  such that their ability to make payments was impaired  additional allowances could be required 
warranty our current standard product warranty includes a five year warranty period for defects in material and workmanship and a year warranty period for declines in power performance which are standard in the solar industry 
when we recognize revenue  we accrue a liability for the estimated future costs of meeting our warranty obligations  our levels of which are consistent with industry ranges 
we make and revise this estimate based on the number of solar panels shipped and our historical experience with warranty claims 
during  we re evaluated potential warranty exposure as a result of the substantial increase in production volumes at our devens  massachusetts manufacturing facility 
as such  we increased our estimated future warranty costs to approximately million as of december  we engage in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  in an effort to ensure the quality of our product and reduce our warranty exposure 
our warranty obligation will be affected not only by our product failure rates  but also the costs to repair or replace failed products and potential service and delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if our actual product failure rates  repair or replacement costs  or service or delivery costs differ from these estimates  accrued warranty costs would be adjusted in the period that such events or costs become known 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost arising from the grant of share based payments to employees at fair value and recognize such cost in our operating results over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  usually the vesting period  in accordance with the provisions of the stock compensation 
table of contents topic of the fasb codification 
total equity compensation expense recognized during the years ended december   and was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
for grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the awards service periods  which are the vesting periods  less estimated forfeitures 
for grants of stock options we estimate the fair value using the black scholes option valuation model 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award  the expected option term  the expected volatility of our stock over the option s expected term  the risk free interest rate over the stock option s expected term and the annual dividend yield 
during and  we granted  shares and  shares  respectively  of performance based restricted stock  all of which immediately vest upon the achievement of specific financial performance targets prior to and  respectively 
of the million shares granted   shares have since been cancelled due to employee terminations 
we have assumed that none of these performance based awards will vest and accordingly have not provided for compensation expense associated with the awards 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of reaching the performance requirements and will be required to recognize compensation expense of approximately million associated with these performance based awards if such awards should vest 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stock based compensation assumptions and expenses 
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined on a first in  first out basis 
certain factors may impact the net realizable value of our inventory including  but not limited to  technological changes  market demand  changes in product mix strategy  new product introductions and significant changes to our cost structure 
estimates of reserves are made for obsolescence based on the current product mix on hand and its expected net realizable value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable or other factors arise that are significantly different than those anticipated by management  additional inventory write downs or increases in obsolescence reserves may be required 
we consider lower of cost or market adjustments and inventory reserves as an adjustment to the cost basis of the underlying inventory 
accordingly  favorable changes in market conditions are not recorded to inventory in subsequent periods 
in addition  we have made non refundable prepayments under several of our multi year polysilicon supply agreements which are presented on the balance sheet in prepaid cost of inventory 
these prepayments will be amortized as an additional cost of inventory as we receive and utilize the silicon 
the prepayments are classified as short term based upon the value of silicon contracted to be delivered during the next twelve months 
we carry these prepayments on our balance sheet at cost and periodically evaluate the vendor s ability to fulfill its obligations under the terms of the silicon contract 
impairment of long lived assets our policy regarding long lived assets is to evaluate the recoverability or usefulness of these assets when the facts and circumstances suggest that these assets may be impaired 
this analysis relies on a number of factors  including changes in strategic direction  business plans  regulatory developments  economic and budget projections  technological improvements  and operating results 
the test of recoverability or usefulness is a comparison of the asset value to the undiscounted cash flow of its expected cumulative net operating cash flow over the asset s remaining useful life 
if such a test indicates that an impairment exists  then the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
any write downs would be treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amounts of the assets and an operating loss would be recognized 
to date  we have had recurring operating losses and the recoverability of our long lived assets is contingent upon executing our business plan that includes further reducing our manufacturing costs and significantly increasing sales 
if we are unable to execute our business plan  we may be required to write down the value of our long lived assets in future periods 

table of contents income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of our consolidated financial statements 
this involves estimating the actual current tax in addition to assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences together with net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
a judgment must then be made of the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent that we determine that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be utilized  a valuation allowance is established 
taxable income in future periods significantly different from that projected may cause adjustments to the valuation allowance that could materially increase or decrease future income tax expense 
results of operations description of our revenues  costs and expenses revenues 
our total revenues consist of revenues from the sale of products  royalty revenue associated with our ongoing technology agreement with sovello  and fees from sovello for our marketing and selling activities associated with sales of product manufactured by sovello under the evergreen solar brand

it also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant expansion program  to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures 
we expect to incur significant facility start up expenses as we continue to plan and qualify new facilities 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges consist of costs associated with the closure of our marlboro pilot manufacturing facility on december  and the transition of our panel assembly operation to china 
the charges primarily include severance costs  the write off of manufacturing equipment  leasehold improvements and inventory  the cost of moving equipment out of the facility  occupancy expenses and accelerated depreciation expenses 
other income expense  net

table of contents equity income loss from interest in sovello ag and impairment of investment 
we account for our one third share of sovello s operating results under the equity method of accounting  which requires us to record our one third share of sovello s net income or loss as one line item in our consolidated statement of operations 
we also account for any impairment of the carrying value of our aggregate investment  including advances  when the impairment is determined to be other than temporary in nature 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
our product revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase in product revenues resulted from increased sales volume which was generated from our new devens facility which began shipping product in the third quarter of product revenue for most of was generated from our now closed marlboro facility 
during the year ended december  we shipped approximately mw compared to mw for the year ended december  this increase in volume was offset by lower selling prices which have declined  on average  by approximately from as a result of continued pricing pressures in the market place in addition to a stronger us dollar during in addition  we believe that sales were negatively impacted by the credit constraints that began with the worldwide economic downturn 
royalty revenue and marketing and selling fees earned from sovello for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of or million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in royalty revenue and marketing and selling fees from sovello was due mainly to substantially lower sales volume at sovello which was down approximately 
in addition  we did not recognize royalty revenue during the fourth quarter of as a result of our impairment of our investment in sovello  and we do not expect to recognize royalty revenue from sovello in the foreseeable future 
international product revenues accounted for and of total product revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in our capacity  driven by the completion of our devens facility  has allowed us to continually adjust our distribution strategy as the markets for solar energy rapidly develop and change 
the following table summarizes the concentration of our product revenues by geography and customer by geography united states germany all other by customer ibc solar ag ralos vertriebs gmbh wagner co 
solartechnik gmbh sunpower corporation all other cost of product revenues and gross margin 
our cost of product revenues for the year ended december  was approximately million  an increase of approximately million  from million for the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin primarily resulted from the significant decline in average selling prices that began during the early part of to a lesser extent  gross margins were 
table of contents negatively impacted by higher costs associated with initial production at our devens facility  the level of fixed costs in relation to our sales volumes as we ramped capacity at devens during  and lower royalty and selling fees from sovello 
the higher initial production costs experienced at our devens facility resulted from inefficiencies we anticipated during the early stages of our significant capacity expansion 
we do not expect substantial improvements in gross margin until our wuhan  china facility reaches meaningful production levels and we complete the transition of devens panel assembly to china  both of which are expected to begin during research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million a decrease of approximately million  or  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to lower depreciation expense of approximately million resulting from the write off of research and development equipment in december that supported now obsolete technologies  lower allocated manufacturing support costs of approximately million  lower professional fees of approximately  and lower travel costs of approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  in general  our selling  general and administrative costs have increased as a result of our overall expansion of operations 
these increases were primarily attributable to increased compensation and related costs of approximately  associated with additional personnel  higher incentive compensation accruals and the inclusion of devens related general and administrative support personnel which in the prior year were partially classified within facility start up costs 
these compensation increases were partially offset by an organization wide salary reduction which was effective during the second and third quarters of in addition  we incurred higher trade show and customer support costs of approximately  including sales commissions associated with higher commissionable sales  increased information technology costs of approximately  to support the growth of our operations  higher insurance costs of  associated with our expanded facilities and workforce  increased depreciation of  related to additional equipment needed to support additional personnel  and higher legal costs of  in support of our on going operations 
these increases were partially offset by lower travel related costs of  write off of loan receivable from silicon supplier 
during december  we entered into a multi year silicon supply agreement with silicium de provence silpro which provided the general terms and conditions pursuant to which silpro would supply us with specified annual quantities of silicon at fixed prices beginning in and continuing through in connection with this supply agreement  we loaned silpro million euros  which was scheduled to be repaid in the first quarter of the loan carried an interest rate of compounded annually 
in april as a result of its inability to obtain additional financing to continue construction of its factory  silpro announced that the french commercial court ordered the filing for judicial settlement proceedings redressement judiciaire  a process similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the united states 
as a result  the loan receivable and the related interest from silpro will not be repaid  and we recognized a non cash charge of million 
in august  the court ordered liquidation proceedings liquidation judiciaire due to silpro s inability to secure further financing 
equipment write offs 
in our continuing efforts to streamline our operations  we incurred charges of approximately million during the year ended december  as a result of the write off of certain devens equipment in addition to development equipment that was discontinued in the fourth quarter 
facility start up 
in preparing for the operations of our devens  massachusetts  midland  michigan and wuhan  china facilities we incurred costs during the year ended december  of approximately million  a decrease of million from million in start up costs include salaries and personnel related costs  consulting costs  consumable material costs  utilities and miscellaneous other costs associated with preparing and qualifying these facilities for production 
construction of the facility in devens began in september  and the first solar panels were produced in the third quarter of construction of the facility in midland began during the third quarter of with the first production runs beginning in the fourth quarter of planning for our facility in china  which is expected to be operational during mid  began during the second quarter of 
table of contents restructuring charges 
we recorded a charge to continuing operations of approximately million for the year ended december  a substantial portion of these charges relate to the acceleration of our strategic initiative to focus on our unique wafer manufacturing technology and transition our devens based panel assembly to china as was approved in the fourth quarter of we expect to reduce manufacturing costs associated with panel assembly once the transition is completed 
the charges associated with beginning this transition were comprised primarily of accelerated depreciation 
in addition to the charges for panel assembly  we incurred on going costs  including rent  depreciation  utilities  supplies and professional fees associated with closing our marlboro  massachusetts pilot manufacturing facility in december  part of our ongoing efforts to lower overhead costs and reduce overall cash requirements 
we expect we will continue to incur occupancy and moving costs through the expiration of the lease in mid and incur location restoration costs 
for the year ended december  we recorded a charge to continuing operations  principally non cash  of approximately million associated with closing marlboro 
nearly all of the marlboro pilot manufacturing facility employees transferred to the devens manufacturing facility to fill open positions associated with its second phase 
the charges we recorded were comprised primarily of leasehold improvements and other related building costs of million  equipment of approximately million  inventory and spare parts of million  and salaries and personal related costs associated with severance of approximately million 
other income expense net 
other net expense of million for the year ended december  was comprised of approximately million in interest income and approximately million of net foreign exchange gains  offset by approximately million in interest expense 
other income  net  of  for the year ended december  was comprised of approximately million of net foreign exchange losses and approximately million in interest expense  offset by approximately million in interest income 
the increase in net foreign exchange gains was due to the mark to market adjustment on our euro denominated loan to a silicon supplier during the first quarter in addition to the timing of our euro denominated transactions 
the decrease in interest income is attributable to lower interest rates in addition to our lower average cash balances that resulted from our use of cash for the construction of the devens and midland facilities  and our operational requirements driven by the growth of our business 
the higher interest expense is attributable to our higher convertible debt obligations which increased by approximately million during the third quarter of and lower capitalized interest costs that resulted from the substantial completion of the devens facility 
this increase was partially offset by a slightly lower interest coupon rate on the new borrowings 
in addition to our convertible debt  we incurred interest expense on the loan advances we received from hstic during the third and fourth quarters of associated with our expansion into china 
equity income loss from interest in sovello ag and impairment of investment 
the equity loss from our interest in sovello for the year ended december   excluding the impairment charge  was approximately million compared to equity income of million  net of withholding taxes  for the year ended december  the decrease in sovello s operating results was primarily due to the substantial decrease in its sales volume 
in addition  for the year ended december  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to our aggregate investment in sovello  including advances  as a result of the significant deterioration in sovello s operations  due in part to the on going deterioration in world wide pricing for their products  and their continued difficulties in renegotiating their bank financing 
during the year ended december  we recorded an million income tax benefit in our statement of operations as a result of the impairment charge recorded against the book basis of our investment in sovello 
this income tax benefit arose from the reversal of a previously recorded deferred income tax liability 
net loss 
as a result of the foregoing  our net loss was million for the year ended december  net loss per share  basic and diluted compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  net loss per share  basic and diluted 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
our product revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of or million from million for the year ended december  this increase in product revenues resulted from an increase in sales volume of which was generated from our new devens facility which began 
table of contents shipping product late in the third quarter 
to a lesser extent  product revenues benefited from higher average selling prices of approximately that primarily resulted from a geographic shift in sales to europe 
royalty revenue and marketing and selling fees from sovello for the year ended december  were million  an increase of or million from million for the year ended december  the increase in royalty revenue and marketing and selling fees from sovello was mainly due to the increased sales volume at sovello which started production at its second facility in the second quarter of international product revenues accounted for and of total product revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
throughout most of orders were largely fulfilled based upon geography 
more than half of the product produced at sovello was distributed to customers in europe and the majority of the product produced at our marlboro facility was distributed to customers in the united states which allowed us to efficiently manage worldwide distribution of product 
however  during approximately of our product shipments were to europe in order to respond to specific customer demand 
as we increase our own capacity with the completion of our devens facility  we expect that we will continually adjust our distribution strategy as markets for solar energy rapidly develop and change 
the following table summarizes the concentration of our product revenues by geography and customer by geography united states germany all other by customer sunpower corporation ralos vertriebs gmbh sunedison grosolar all other cost of product revenues and gross margin 
our cost of product revenues for the year ended december  was million  an increase of approximately million  or  from million for the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin primarily resulted from higher costs associated with the initial production at our new devens facility and lower support costs allocated to research and development supporting pilot programs 
these higher costs were offset by higher royalty and selling fees associated with the increase in sovello s sales volume  higher silicon scrap sales and the increase in the volume of our product sales 
these higher initial production costs are temporary and resulted from inefficiencies we anticipated during the initial stages of our significant capacity expansion 
we do anticipate that gross margins will improve as the devens facility continues to increase its output and expects to reach its full production capacity during the second half of  and selling prices remain relatively stable 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million net of  of reimbursements from sovello  an increase of million  or approximately  from million net of million of reimbursements from sovello  for the comparable period 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher depreciation expense of approximately million associated with the expanded r d facilities and associated equipment additions 
this increase was offset primarily by lower compensation and related costs of approximately  the majority of which relates to realignment of

our selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  an increase of million  or approximately  from million in in general  our selling  general and administrative costs have increased as a result of our overall expansion of operations 
as we continue to execute our expansion plans  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase to support such growth 
specifically  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to increased compensation and related costs of approximately  associated with additional personnel  higher marketing and communication costs of  associated with increased advertising and the grand opening of our new devens facility  increased it costs of approximately  to support the growth of our operations  higher insurance costs of  associated with our expanded facilities  higher depreciation costs of  and generally higher public company and regulatory compliance fees

the increase in net foreign exchange losses was due to the timing of our euro denominated transactions in addition to the mark to market adjustment on our euro denominated loan to a silicon supplier 
the increase in interest income is attributable to our higher average cash balance that resulted from the cash raised from our equity offering in the first quarter of and the senior convertible notes offering during the third quarter of  in addition to interest earned on our loans receivable 
the higher interest expense is attributable to our higher debt obligations which increased by approximately million associated with our new borrowings to support our capacity expansion plans offset by a slightly lower interest rate on the new borrowings and higher capitalized interest costs resulting primarily from the on going construction of our devens facility and our new facility in midland  michigan

the commonwealth of massachusetts support program provided a low cost  year land lease in addition to approximately million in grants 
during  we also began construction of our new high temperature filament manufacturing facility in midland  michigan which began its first production runs during the fourth quarter of as of december   we had outstanding commitments for capital expenditures of approximately million 
most of our commitments for capital expenditures are associated with our devens and wuhan facilities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during we sold million shares of our common stock in a public offering at per share which closed on may  and resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  we received a loan of approximately million from the chinese government as part of the financing for our wuhan  china manufacturing facility 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the net proceeds of million from the issuance of our senior convertible debt offering which closed during the third quarter of and the net proceeds of million shares of our common stock sold in a public offering at per share which closed in february these proceeds were offset by the up front initial premium payment of million associated with the capped call transaction which was entered into concurrent with the senior convertible debt offering 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the net proceeds of million shares of our common stock sold in a public offering at per share and which closed on may  an additional million shares of our common stock were sold to oci for per share in conjunction with a stock purchase agreement 
on june   we entered into an underwriting agreement for the sale to the public of million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due the senior notes 
we granted to the underwriters a day option to purchase up to an additional million aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
on july   we completed the public offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which includes the underwriter s exercise of their option 
net proceeds to us from the offering  including the cost of the capped call transaction  were approximately million 
our financing costs associated with the senior notes are being amortized over the five year term 
in june  we issued convertible subordinated notes or notes in the aggregate principal amount of million with interest on the notes payable semiannually at an annual rate of 
we had received proceeds of million  net of offering costs of approximately million 
all of the notes were converted to shares of our common stock  and we issued  shares of common stock to the note holders on july  for the years ended december   and  we recorded approximately million  million and million  respectively  in interest expense associated with the notes and senior notes  and capitalized interest of approximately  million and million  respectively 
in addition we recorded approximately in interest expense for the loan received from hstic associated with our expansion into china 
in connection with our senior notes offering  we entered into a capped call transaction with respect to our common stock with an affiliate of lehman brothers  inc  the lead underwriter  in order to reduce the dilution that would otherwise occur as a result of new common stock issuances upon conversion of the senior notes 
the capped call transaction was designed to reduce the potential dilution resulting from the conversion of the senior notes into shares of our common stock 
the total premium for the capped call transaction was approximately million of which million was paid contemporaneously with the closing of the senior notes offering and the remaining million was required to be paid in nine equal semi annual installments beginning january  in addition  we entered into a common stock lending agreement with a second affiliate of the lead underwriter pursuant to which we loaned  shares of our common stock to this affiliate 
these shares were considered issued and outstanding for corporate law purposes at the time they were loaned  however  at the time of the loan they were 
table of contents not considered outstanding for the purpose of computing and reporting earnings per share because these shares were to be returned to us no later than july   the maturity date of the senior notes 
on september  and october   respectively  lehman brothers holdings inc  the parent company of lead underwriter  and the lead underwriter s affiliate that entered into the capped call transaction with us filed for protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code 
the lead underwriter s second affiliate that was party to the stock lending agreement was placed into administration in the united kingdom shortly thereafter 
the bankruptcy filings represented events of default under the capped call transaction 
as a result of the defaults  our obligations under the agreement were suspended and the remaining premium liability was reversed against equity 
in the event the defaults are cured  the remaining premium liability would be owed pursuant to the installment payment schedule 
unless we choose to implement a new capped call arrangement or the defaults are cured and we do not terminate the capped call transaction as we believe we are entitled to under the terms of the capped call transaction  the dilutive impact of conversion of the senior notes may be greater  based on the actual conversion price of per share 
the bankruptcy filing and the placement of the lead underwriter s second affiliate into administration in the united kingdom also contractually required the lead underwriter s second affiliate to return to us the shares loaned under the common stock lending agreement 
we have since demanded the immediate return of all outstanding borrowed shares  however  the shares have not yet been returned 
while we are exercising all of our legal remedies  including litigation against various lehman brothers entities and barclays entities  we have included these shares in our per share calculation on a weighted average basis due to the uncertainty surrounding the recovery of the shares 
sovello ag loans  debt guarantees and undertakings in january  we  rec and q cells entered into a shareholder loan agreement with sovello 
under the terms of the shareholder loan agreement  sovello repaid all outstanding shareholder loans at that time  plus accrued interest  in exchange for a shareholder loan of million euros approximately million at december  exchange rates from each shareholder 
since that time  we  rec and q cells have entered into several other shareholder loan agreements with sovello with our share denominated in us dollars 
interest on the january loan and million june loan is payable quarterly in arrears  however such payments have been suspended 
interest on the million december loan and million march loan is payable concurrent with the repayment of the underlying principal amounts 
the loans  which in the aggregate total approximately million at december   prior to the impairment charge  carry interest rates ranging from to and are included in investments in and advances to sovello ag on the balance sheet 
based upon an agreement between sovello s shareholders and sovello s bank  the loans and interest thereon will not be repaid until the earlier of the completion of an initial public offering or other liquidity event generating sufficient cash to repay the loans 
on april   we entered into a guarantee and undertaking agreement the old guarantee with deutsche bank in connection with sovello entering into a loan agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by duetsche bank 
the loan agreement originally provided sovello with aggregate borrowing availability of up to million euros approximately million at december  exchange rates which was amended to million euros in september approximately million at december  exchange rates 
pursuant to the old guarantee  we along with q cells and rec  each agreed to guarantee a one third portion of the loan outstanding  up to million euros of sovello s repayment obligations under the loan agreement 
at december  we had million deposited in a deutsche bank ag account fulfilling our obligation under the old guarantee  which was classified as restricted cash on the balance sheet 
effective september  the guarantee and associated restriction on our million of cash deposited with deutsche bank ag were released 
as of december   the total amount of debt outstanding under the loan agreement was million euros approximately million at december  exchange rates all of which was current 
repayment of the loan is due in quarterly installments through december  in october in connection with a bank loan to sovello  we provided an undertaking to the bank syndicate that would require us to provide additional funding to sovello under the following circumstances 
table of contents in the event that the cost of completing sovello exceeds budget  if any government grants are required to be repaid by sovello or are not provided to sovello as previously approved  or under certain conditions  in the event that sovello is in violation of its financial covenants associated with its loan with the bank syndicate 
on january   the european commission announced a decision that a certain portion of the grants known as the sme bonus which was awarded to sovello in should be recalled 
the amount to be recalled  million euros plus approximately million euros in interest in total approximately million at current exchange rates was paid to sovello as a special bonus available only to small and medium sized companies 
the commission ordered the german authorities to recover the sme bonus from sovello 
we may be required to provide funding to sovello approximately million euros to repay a portion of the sme bonus pursuant to an undertaking dated october  made to a consortium of banks led by deutsche bank ag 
in addition  as previously disclosed  sovello has been in default under its bank loan agreement since the end of throughout  sovello operated under waivers from its bank syndicate of certain loan covenant violations  and on january   sovello s bank syndicate terminated their loan agreement but has not yet demanded repayment of the outstanding loan 
if the above matters are not satisfactorily resolved  sovello may need to declare insolvency which could result in further financial obligations of us  including possible payment of a portion of the recalled sme bonus under the undertaking previously discussed and other non cash charges relating to an impairment in our investments in sovello 
alternatively  we may provide a small amount of additional capital to sovello in connection with the sale of sovello to a new shareholder 
however  it is difficult to predict exactly the amount of  if any  further costs that may be incurred by us in the event of an insolvency or sale of sovello 
during the third quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million on our aggregate investment in sovello 
in light of developments at sovello  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million during the fourth quarter  reflecting the write off of our remaining investment in sovello 
additionally  we recorded charges of approximately million for payments under our guarantee that was paid on february  and million for estimated payments relating to undertakings with sovello s bank and for other expected costs 
combined  the fourth quarter charges of million and third quarter charge of are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
we and the other shareholders of sovello are now attempting to sell sovello 
if it cannot be sold by the shareholders  it will likely become insolvent and will be sold or liquidated to repay amounts outstanding under sovello s credit agreement with its banks 
the sale we are attempting to negotiate will require us to make a small additional investment in sovello 
in the case of either a sale or insolvency we believe our additional obligations that could arise are limited  but no assurance can be made regarding additional potential costs given the uncertainties associated with negotiating a sale of a distressed company or the possible insolvency process 
liquidity risk and uncertainty at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  which includes approximately million received from hstic as part of its funding obligation for our wuhan  china factory expansion and have been approved for a loan of approximately million from the commonwealth of massachusetts 
through  our major cash requirements are expected to be approximately million  comprised of capital required for our wuhan  china expansion of about million  final acceptance payments on equipment for devens of about million  first phase of our midland filament factory of about million  sustaining capital of about million  estimated payments for sovello matters of about million  and debt service of about million 
we have sales contracts for approximately mw of product to be manufactured at our devens facility for delivery during our sales plan assumes there should be sufficient market demand to sell the expected devens manufacturing capacity at continually declining selling prices 
we expect to continue to moderate our production levels depending on changes in market demands during the year 

table of contents we believe that our business plan will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our planned capital programs  our share of any potential funding requirements related to our investment in sovello and our operating needs for the next months 
while our business plan anticipates certain levels of potential risk  particularly in light of the difficult and uncertain current economic environment and the continuing reduction of industry panel pricing caused by emerging competition  especially from china  and the resulting excess capacity  we are exposed to additional particular risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to the need to maintain the devens facility at a minimum of capacity  or mw per quarter  and stabilization of panel pricing at about per watt  with sales made to creditworthy customers  higher than planned manufacturing costs and failing to achieve expected devens operating metrics  with any delays in our plan to transition panel assembly to china resulting in continued higher costs that could impair business operations  continued significant fluctuation of the euro against the us dollar  as a substantial portion of the contracted sales are denominated in euros  the ability of jiawei to execute against its plans to meet our required timetables  and increased funding requirements for sovello to potentially address the loss of any prior or expected government grant funding for sovello see note of our consolidated financial statements 
although our current business plan indicates we have adequate liquidity to operate under expected operating conditions  the risks noted above could result in liquidity uncertainty 
our plan with regard to this uncertainty includes  among other actions continually monitoring our operating results against expectations and  if required  further restricting operating costs and capital spending if events warrant  if market conditions allow  possibly accessing the capital markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements  negotiating with a number of banks to secure a borrowing base line of credit  without a minimum cash requirement as was required under our line of credit  supported by the expected significant increase in our accounts receivable  inventory and overall working capital  and possibly hedging a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in the us dollar euro exchange rate to limit any adverse exposure  but there can be no assurance that hedges can be put in place at terms acceptable to us or that such hedging activities will be effective 
if additional capital is needed and does not become available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund operations  further develop and expand our manufacturing operations and distribution network or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited

issuance of the restricted shares represented a prepayment of inventory cost valued at approximately million  based on the issuance date market price of our common stock adjusted for a discount to reflect the transfer restriction  and will be amortized as an additional cost of inventory as silicon is delivered by oci and utilized by us 
when the transfer restriction on these shares lapse  we will record an additional cost of inventory equal to the value of the discount associated with the restriction at that time if the stock price on that date is higher than which will be amortized as an incremental cost of inventory as silicon is delivered by oci and utilized by us 
on july   we entered into a multi year polysilicon supply agreement with wacker chemie ag wacker

as a result  the loan receivable from silpro and the related interest will not be repaid and we recognized a non cash charge of million 
in august  the court ordered liquidation proceedings liquidation judiciaire due to silpro s inability to secure further financing

we have evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realization of our deferred tax assets 
we have considered our history of losses and  in accordance with the applicable accounting standards  have fully reserved the deferred tax asset 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  an update was made to the earning per share topic of the fasb codification that clarified that all outstanding unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders 
awards of this nature are considered participating securities and the two class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share must be applied 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted the guidance and due to current and prior period losses there is no impact as such losses are not attributable or allocated to such securities

table of contents in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas establishes the fasb standards accounting codification codification as the source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied to nongovernmental entities and rules and interpretive releases of the sec as authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification supersedes all the existing non sec accounting and reporting standards upon its effective date and subsequently  the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts 
sfas also replaces fasb statement no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles given that once in effect  the codification will carry the same level of authority 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  and is effective for our third quarter filing 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  an update was made to the revenue recognition topic of the fasb codification that removes the objective and reliable evidence of fair value criterion from the separation criteria used to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting  replaces references to fair value with selling price to distinguish from the fair value measurements required under the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the fasb codification  provides a hierarchy that entities must use to estimate the selling price  eliminates the use of the residual method for allocation  and expands the ongoing disclosure requirements 
this update is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of the guidance to have an impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

more specifically  this update will require a an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers into and out of level and fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers  and b information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements to be presented separately on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  except for level reconciliation disclosures which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of the guidance to have an impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe that the impact of these fluctuations will not have a material effect on our financial position due to the liquidity and short term nature of these financial instruments 
for these reasons  a hypothetical basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk as we expand our manufacturing operations and distribution network internationally  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates may increase 
we endeavor to denominate the purchase price of our equipment and materials and the selling price for our products in us dollars but are not always successful in doing so 
to the extent that our purchases or sales are made in foreign currency  we will be exposed to currency gains or losses 
for the year ended december   approximately of our product revenues were denominated in euros 
the portion of our sales that are denominated in euros can vary widely in any one period 
as of the year ended december   we have six active multi year solar panel supply agreements which we entered into in  a portion of which are denominated in euros 
the combined current estimated sales value remaining under these six agreements is approximately billion at december  exchange rates 
these panel supply agreements provide the general terms and conditions pursuant to which certain customers will purchase from us specified annual quantities of solar panels which began in the second half of and continue through from time to time  we purchase equipment and materials internationally with delivery dates as much as six to twelve months or more in the future 
there have been significant currency fluctuations in recent periods 
to the extent that any purchase obligations are denominated in foreign currency  we would be exposed to potential increased costs if the us dollar currency loses value relative to the applicable foreign currency  which will adversely impact our future financial condition and results of operations 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may enter into hedging transactions in the future  given that the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited  we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure
