markets and applications our products are currently used in a variety of consumer electronic devices  including the following digital television the digital television market represents the most significant technological shift in the consumer electronics market since color televisions were introduced in the late s 
today  digital content providers broadcast programming via satellite  cable or terrestrial over the air networks 
the mix of broadcast networks varies by geographic region 
for example  most digital television content in japan and korea is broadcast via terrestrial networks  while cable networks currently predominate in the united states 
satellite networks offer an alternative source of content to consumers and are continuing to grow in various regions such as india 
each geographic market is subject to regulations that require compliance with different governmental standards applicable to broadcast technology and content format 
in each region  individual broadcasters also have developed their own proprietary standards for content  security and conditional access 
this market requires television products  set top boxes  personal video recorders and other digital consumer appliances that include sophisticated integrated circuits and embedded software that address the emerging requirements of multiple broadcast networks throughout the world 
the requirement by the us federal communications commission  or fcc  that all new televisions contain a built in digital receiver  has accelerated the growth of the digital television market in the us mobile products digital cameras enable consumers to capture high resolution images  view  edit and store them on a computer system and transmit over telephone lines and computer networks 
high quality copies of these images can be printed using color printers 
digital cameras have added audio video capture and compression capabilities enabling them to function as digital video camcorders 
digital cameras can be connected directly to a pc for downloading of pictures or movies and to a television for display 
many mobile phones now incorporate digital still camera and camcorder functionality 
photos and video clip files can be immediately sent to another mobile phone or pc via email  downloaded to a printer or pc for printing or storing via wired or wireless technology 
with the spread of new technology and decreased manufacturing costs  mobile phones are including high resolution digital camera capabilities at increasingly lower price points 
consumer video playback systems red laser and blu ray dvd players primarily use mpeg video compression and dolby digital or similar audio technology to provide significantly higher quality playback than earlier generation products such as vcrs  video cd or super video cd players 

table of contents digital imaging print products the market for digital imaging print products includes both printers and mfp that print  scan  copy and fax 
the market comprises both business and enterprise segments  served primarily by networked laser products and consumer segments served primarily by ink jet products 
in the enterprise networked segment  most devices utilize a page description language pdl to transmit the document to be printed from the application to the printer 
the embedded controller in the printer or mfp then interprets and renders the file into pixels to be laid down on the paper 
in general  applications are designed to send jobs to printers using one or all of a number of protocols or language families 
print control language  or pcl  originated as a hewlett packard developed protocol for page printers and has become an industry standard in office environments 
both pcl and pcl xl  or pcl  are supported in office printers today 
the application may also use the postscript language originally developed by adobe 
more recently  printers have also offered support for portable digital document formats that are designed to be widely viewed and shared  such as pdf  originally developed by adobe and xml paper specification  or xps  a new format  introduced by microsoft is also being deployed as a format in printers

customers our customers consist primarily of oems  original design manufacturers odms  and resellers in both domestic and international markets 
because we leverage our technologies across different markets  certain of our integrated circuits may be incorporated into equipment used in several markets 
our sales and marketing teams work closely with our customers to define product features  performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet the needs of our customers 
we also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing  testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products 
we believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers time to market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products 
in  three customers accounted for  and of our total revenues  respectively 
research and development we believe that our future success depends on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop new products that maintain technological competitiveness and compliance with new standards in rapidly evolving consumer oriented digital audio and video markets 
we attempt to leverage our expertise in the fields of digital signal processing  integrated circuit design  algorithms and software development to maintain our position as a leader in the development of digital audio  video and imaging solutions 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our resources to maintaining and upgrading our products to reduce integrated circuit cost  power consumption and the number of integrated circuits required to perform compression and other functions necessary for the evolving digital audio  video and imaging application markets 
in addition  we seek to design integrated circuits and cores  as well as near production ready reference designs that reduce the time needed by manufacturers to integrate our ics into their products 
we are a party to research and development agreements with the chief scientist in israel s ministry of industry and trade and the israel united states bi national industrial research and development foundation 
these organizations fund up to of incurred costs for approved projects up to contract maximums 
the agreements require us to use our best efforts to achieve specified results and to pay royalties at rates of to of resulting product sales and up to of resulting license revenues  up to a maximum of to of the total funding received 
reported research and development expenses are net of these grants  which fluctuate from period to period 
the amount received was   and  in  and  respectively 
the terms of israeli government funding include restrictions on the location of research and development activities  and the terms of the grants from the chief scientist prohibit the transfer of technology developed pursuant to these grants to any person without the prior written consent of the chief scientist 

table of contents sales and marketing our sales and marketing strategy is to focus on providing solutions to manufacturers seeking to design audio  video and imaging products for existing and emerging high volume consumer applications 
we attempt to identify market segments that have the potential for substantial growth 
to implement our strategy  we have established a worldwide direct sales force in offices located near our key customers and strategic partners  and a worldwide network of independent sales representatives and resellers 
in some cases  our strategic partners also provide sales and marketing support 
our sales are generally made pursuant to purchase orders received between one and six months prior to the scheduled delivery date 
we sell our products primarily through our direct sales staff  field application engineers  and customer service staff located in the united states and internationally 
our united states sales staff is primarily responsible for sales in north america  europe and south america 
sales management and sales operations staff also reside in the united states 
our sales and field application engineers in china  japan  korea and taiwan are responsible for marketing and technical support in their respective regions 
in addition  we sell our products indirectly through selected resellers and commissioned sales representatives 
to date  we have not experienced material product returns or warranty expense 
we have offices in shenzhen and shanghai  china as part of our effort to capture a leadership position in the chinese digital audio and video markets and offices in taipei and hsinchu  taiwan in an effort to better address the video  imaging and digital camera market 
in addition  we operate sales support offices in hong kong  india and korea that provide sales  applications and customer support 
we distribute our products in japan primarily through resellers 
we operate an office in tokyo to help promote our products in japan  to assist with the marketing of products not sold through resellers  such as integrated circuit cores and certain digital camera  digital video  digital television  and imaging products  and to provide applications support to some of our customers 
backlog sales of our products are made pursuant to firm purchase orders 
however  sometimes we allow customers to cancel or reschedule deliveries 
in addition  purchase orders are subject to price renegotiations and to changes in quantities of products ordered as a result of changes in customers requirements and manufacturing availability 
our ability to order products can carry lead times of between four and sixteen weeks  however  most of our business is characterized by short lead times and quick delivery schedules 
as a result of these factors  we do not believe that backlog at any given time is a meaningful indicator of future sales 
manufacturing we contract our wafer fabrication  assembly and testing to independent foundries and contractors  which enables us to focus on our design strengths  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing facilities 
our engineers work closely with our foundry partners and subcontractors to increase yields  lower manufacturing costs and assure quality 
most of our devices are currently fabricated using standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor process technology with micron to micron feature sizes 
our primary foundry is taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc  which has manufactured integrated circuits for us since tsmc and tower semiconductor ltd 
are currently manufacturing our dvd  dtv  imaging and mobile products 
lsi corporation is providing turn key manufacturing for one high end laser printer product 
our independent foundries fabricate products for other companies and may also produce products of their own design 
by subcontracting our manufacturing requirements  we can focus our resources on design and test applications where we believe we have greater competitive advantages 
this strategy also eliminates the high cost of owning and operating semiconductor wafer 
table of contents fabrication facilities 
most of our semiconductor products are currently being assembled by one of two independent contractors and tested by those contractors or other independent contractors 
our primary services company for assembly and testing is advanced semiconductor engineering inc our operations and quality engineering teams closely manage the interface between manufacturing and design engineering 
we currently purchase products from all of our foundries under individually negotiated purchase orders 
we do not currently have a long term supply contract with tsmc  and therefore tsmc is not obligated to manufacture products for us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
competition our existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater finance  manufacturing  technology  marketing  personnel and distribution resources than we have 
some of these competitors also have broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we do 
some of our principal competitors maintain their own semiconductor foundries and may therefore benefit from capacity  cost and technical advantages 
our principal competitors in the integrated audio and video devices for dvd applications include mediatek inc and sunplus technology co 
ltd 
in the markets for digital cameras  our principal competitors are in house solutions developed and used by major japanese oems  as well as products sold by ambarella  fujitsu  novatech  sunplus and texas instruments  inc our principal competitors for digital semiconductor devices in the digital television market include broadcom corp  m star  mediatek inc  st microelectronics and trident 
competitors in the printer and multifunction peripheral space include adobe  conexant systems  inc  global graphics  marvell semiconductor  inc 
and in house captive suppliers 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving markets for high performance audio  video and imaging technology depends on a number of factors  including the following quality  performance  features and price of our products  the timing and success of new product introductions by us  our customers and our competitors  the emergence of new industry standards  ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity  the number and nature of our competitors in a given market  and general market and economic conditions 
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  declining average unit selling prices and rapid product obsolescence 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with solutions which may be less costly or provide higher performance or more desirable features than our products 
historically  average unit selling prices asps in the semiconductor industry in general  and for our products in particular  have decreased over the life of a particular product 
we expect that the asps of our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures 
in order to offset expected declines in the asps of our products  we seek to continually reduce the cost of our products and continue to integrate additional functions into our ics 
we intend to accomplish this by implementing design changes that integrate additional functionality and lower the cost of manufacturing  assembly and testing by negotiating reduced charges at our foundries as  and if  volumes increase  and by successfully managing our manufacturing and subcontracting relationships 
since we do not operate our own manufacturing  assembly or testing facilities  we may not be able 
table of contents to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities 
if we fail to introduce lower cost versions of our products in a timely manner or to successfully manage our manufacturing  assembly and testing relationships  our business would be harmed 
proprietary rights and licenses our ability to compete successfully is dependent in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology and information 
although we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and licensing arrangements to protect some of our intellectual property  we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel and the success of our ongoing product development efforts are more important in maintaining our competitive position 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  resellers  customers and potential customers and limit access to our proprietary information 
we currently hold issued patents worldwide  and have additional patent applications pending 
our intellectual property rights  if challenged  may not be upheld as valid  may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology  or may not prevent the development of competitive products 
additionally  we may not be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property protection in the future 
in particular  the existence of several consortiums or standards bodies that license patents relating to various standards for consumer electronics and digital technology have created uncertainty with respect to the use and enforceability of patents implementing those standards 
furthermore  the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and  thus  make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
we or our customers from time to time are notified of claims that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
we have been subject to intellectual property claims and litigation in the past 
see item legal proceedings 
we may be subject to additional claims and litigation in the future 
in particular  given the uncertainty discussed above regarding patents relating to the consumer electronics or digital technology standards  it is difficult for us to assess the possibility that our activities in these fields may give rise to future patent infringement claims 
litigation by or against us relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
licenses may not be offered on fair or reasonable terms or the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us 
if we fail to obtain a license from a third party for technology that it uses  we could incur substantial liabilities and be forced to suspend the manufacture of products  or the use by our foundries of certain processes 
we have non exclusive licenses from various third parties 
some of the licenses are for technologies that are required to develop our products while others allow us to sell our products enabled with the third parties respective technologies 
the majority of these agreements do not require us to pay royalties 
under most of our agreements  we may sell such third party enabled products only to customers who are licensees of such third parties 
we rely on our customers to enter into license agreements directly with the third parties pursuant to which they pay royalties and or license fees 
the failure or refusal of potential customers to enter into license agreement with such third parties in the future could harm our sales 
employees as of december   we had  employees  including employees primarily involved in research and development activities  in marketing and sales  in finance  human resources  information systems  legal and administration  and in manufacturing control and quality assurance 
we had employees 
table of contents based in israel  primarily involved in engineering and research and development  employees at our facility in sunnyvale  california and employees at our facility in burlington massachusetts 
we have employees in our china office 
other employees are located in our international offices in france  germany  india  japan  korea  sweden  taiwan and the united kingdom 
we believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled  engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe that our employee relations are good 
item a risk factors our future business  operating results and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
our annual revenues and operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors  which may result in volatility or a decline in the price of our common stock our historical operating results have varied significantly from period to period due to a number of factors  including fluctuation in demand for our products including reduced demand resulting from the current global economic slowdown and general decline in business conditions  the timing of new product introductions or enhancements by us and our competitors  changes in the mix of products sold  our ability to identify new markets and develop products that are accepted by our customers in these markets  the level of market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and our customers products  the timing or cancellation of large customer orders  whether our customers choose our products over those of our competitors for existing or new products and applications  the length and variability of the sales cycle for our products  price changes by our competitors and suppliers  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the availability of development funding  seasonality in demand for our products since revenues in the second half of the calendar year have historically been higher than the first half  increased competition in product lines  and competitive pricing pressures  and the evolving and unpredictable nature of the markets for products incorporating our integrated circuits and embedded software 
we expect that our operating results will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of these factors and a variety of other factors  including the cost and availability of adequate foundry capacity  the loss or gain of important customers  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  
table of contents changes in or the emergence of new industry standards  failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements  product obsolescence  and the amount of research and development expenses associated with new product introductions 
our operating results could also be harmed by economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas where we or our customers do business  a downturn in the markets for our customers products  particularly the consumer electronics market  general financial instability as a result of credit and equity market fluctuations and lack of credit availability for our customers and suppliers and credit market problems  other conditions affecting the timing or size of customer orders  our ability to effectively protect our intellectual property from infringement by others  changes in governmental regulations that could affect our products  disruption in commercial activities associated with heightened security concerns affecting international travel and commerce  liquidity constraints caused by failed auctions and lack of a liquid market for our auction rate securities  tightened immigration controls that may adversely affect the residence status of key non us managers and technical employees in our non us facilities or our ability to hire new non us employees in such facilities  terrorism and international conflicts or other crises  or further worsening or expansion of armed conflict in the middle east which could adversely affect our operations in israel 
these factors are difficult or impossible to forecast 
we place orders with independent foundries several months in advance of the scheduled delivery date  often in advance of receiving non cancelable orders from our customers 
this limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand 
if anticipated shipments in any quarter are canceled or do not occur as quickly as expected  or if we fail to foresee a technology or market change that could render our or one of our customer s products obsolete  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and we may incur charges for excess inventory  which would harm our gross margins and financial results 
if anticipated license revenues in any quarter are canceled  do not occur  or are lower than anticipated  our gross margins and financial results may be affected 
a significant portion of our expenses are relatively fixed  and the timing of increases in expenses is based in large part on our forecast of future revenues 
as a result  if revenues do not meet our expectations  we may be unable to quickly adjust expenses to levels appropriate for our actual revenues  which could harm our operating results 
our customers sales fluctuate due to product cycles and seasonality 
because the markets that our customers serve are characterized by numerous new product introductions and rapid product enhancements and obsolescence  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
during the final production of a mature product  our customers typically exhaust their existing inventories of our products 
consequently  orders for our products may decline in those circumstances  even if the products are incorporated into both mature products and replacement products 
a delay in a customer s transition to commercial production of a replacement product would delay our ability to recover the lost sales 
table of contents from the discontinuation of the related mature product 
our customers also experience significant seasonality in the sales of their consumer products  which affects their orders of our products 
typically  the second half of the calendar year represents a disproportionate percentage of sales for our customers due to the holiday shopping period for consumer electronics products  and therefore  a disproportionate percentage of our sales 
we expect these seasonal sales fluctuations to continue for the foreseeable future and any further or continuing economic slowdown could increase the seasonal decline in sales that we typically see in the first half of the calendar year or mitigate the typical increase in sales in the second half of the calendar year 
our ability to match production mix with the product mix needed to fill current orders and orders to be delivered in a given quarter may affect our ability to meet that quarter s revenue forecast and can lead to excess inventory write offs 
in addition  when responding to customers requests for shorter shipment lead times  we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers demands 
these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions 
if we inaccurately forecast customer demand  we may hold inadequate  excess or obsolete inventory causing us to take write offs that would reduce our profit margins and harm our results of operations and financial condition 
we derive most of our revenue from sales to a small number of large customers  and if we are not able to retain these customers  or they reschedule  reduce or cancel orders  our revenues would be reduced and our financial results would suffer 
our largest customers account for a substantial percentage of our revenues 
for the year ended december   three customers accounted for  and of total revenues while sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of our total revenues 
in  three customers accounted for  and of our total revenues  respectively  and sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of our total revenues 
in the mobile phone market  we currently rely almost exclusively on a single customer 
sales to these large customers have varied significantly from year to year and will continue to fluctuate in the future 
these sales also may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
we may not be able to retain our key customers  or these customers may cancel purchase orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases from us 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of our key customers would harm our sales and financial results 
in addition  any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more key customers could harm our financial results 
as of december   five customers accounted for approximately    and of our net accounts receivable balance  respectively 
our products generally have long sales cycles and implementation periods  which increases our costs in obtaining orders and reduces the predictability of our operating results 
our products are technologically complex 
prospective customers generally must make a significant commitment of resources to test and evaluate our products and to integrate them into larger systems 
as a result  our sales processes are often subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes that typically accompany the design and testing of new products 
the sales cycles of our products  depending on our product line  can range from three to twelve months 
longer sales cycles require us to invest significant resources in attempting to make sales and delay the generation of revenue 
we incur costs related to such sales prior to  and even if we do not succeed in  any sale to a customer 
long sales cycles also subject us to other risks  including customers budgetary constraints or insolvency  internal acceptance reviews and cancellations 
in addition  orders expected in one quarter could shift to another because of the timing of customers purchase decisions  which could harm our financial results in any given period 
the time required for our customers to incorporate our products into their own can vary significantly with the needs of our customers and generally exceeds several months  which further complicates our planning processes and reduces the predictability of our operating results 

table of contents we are not protected by long term contracts with our customers 
we generally do not enter into long term purchase contracts with our customers  and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
customers generally purchase our products subject to cancelable short term purchase orders 
we cannot predict whether our current customers will continue to place orders  whether existing orders will be canceled  or whether customers who have ordered products will pay invoices for delivered products 
when we do enter into a long term contract  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the customer 
termination or reduction in orders by one of our major customers would harm our financial results 
the worldwide economic downturn and other adverse economic factors has reduced our sales and revenues  increased our expenses and hurt our profitability  results of operations and financial condition 
the current worldwide economic downturn has reduced consumer spending on products offered by our customers 
other factors  such as unemployment levels  inflation  deflation  fuel and energy costs  consumer debt levels  interest rates and tax rates  may also reduce overall consumer spending or shift consumer spending to products other than those offered by our customers 
reduced sales by our customers harm our business by reducing demand for our products 
moreover  if customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are precluded from securing financing  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us 
lower net sales of our products and reduced payment capacity of our customers would reduce our current and future revenues 
in addition  our expenses could increase due to  among other things  fluctuations of the value of the united states dollar  changes in interest and tax rates  decreased inventory turnover  increases in vendor prices  and reduced vendor output 
such reduction of our revenues and increase of our expenses hurts our profitability and harms our results of operations and financial condition 
in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes  and some of those estimates are based on our forecasts of future results 
the current volatility in the worldwide economy increases the risk that our actual results will differ materially from our forecasts  requiring adjustments in future financial statements 
trends in global credit markets could result in insolvency of our key suppliers or customers  and customer inability to finance purchases of our products 
the credit market crisis including uncertainties with respect to financial institutions and the global capital markets and other macro economic challenges currently affecting the worldwide economy may adversely affect our customers and suppliers 
as a result of these conditions  our customers may experience cash flow problems  may not be able to obtain credit to finance their purchases and may modify  delay or cancel plans to purchase our products or lengthen payment terms 
if our customers are unable to finance purchases of our products  our sales will be harmed 
similarly  current economic and credit conditions may cause our suppliers to increase their prices  tighten payment terms or reduce their output  which could increase our expenses or impair our sales 
moreover  if one of our key suppliers becomes insolvent  we may not be able to find a suitable substitute in a timely manner and our cost of production may increase 
if economic and credit conditions in the united states and other key markets deteriorate further or do not show improvement  our business and operating results may be harmed 
our products are characterized by average selling prices that typically decline over relatively short time periods  if we are unable to reduce our costs or introduce new products with higher average selling prices  our financial results will suffer 
average selling prices for our products typically decline over relatively short time periods  while many of our manufacturing costs are fixed 
when our average selling prices decline  our revenues decline unless we are able to sell more units and our gross margins decline unless we are able to reduce our manufacturing costs by a commensurate amount 
our operating results suffer when gross margins decline 
we have experienced these 
table of contents problems  and we expect to continue to experience them in the future  although we cannot predict when they may occur or how severe they will be for example  we have experienced declines in average selling prices in fiscal year compared to fiscal year our operating results may be harmed by cyclical and volatile conditions in the markets we address 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
we operate in the semiconductor industry  which is cyclical and from time to time has experienced significant downturns 
downturns in the industry often occur in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles for semiconductor companies and their customers  and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns can cause abrupt fluctuations in product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of average selling prices 
the current worldwide economic downturn and the downturn in our industry has harmed our revenue and our results of operations 
this downturn may be severe and prolonged  which may continue to harm our revenues  gross margins and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints  which may affect our revenues if we are unable to ship enough products to meet customer demand 
the recent worldwide economic downturn makes it extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
this downturn could delay and or lengthen sales cycles by causing us and foreign businesses to slow or postpone spending on our products and services 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery  worldwide  or in the semiconductor industry 
the combination of our lengthy sales cycle coupled with challenging macroeconomic conditions continue to have a compounding negative impact on our results of operations 
our success depends on our ability to develop and market new products in new markets 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards and our customers changing demands 
we sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and increasing demand for higher levels of integration and smaller process geometries 
our past sales and profitability have resulted  to a large extent  from our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products incorporating the new standards and technologies 
our ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards  and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards  will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
if new industry standards emerge  our products or our customers products could become unmarketable or obsolete  and we could lose market share 
we may also have to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards 
our financial performance is highly dependent on the timely and successful introduction of new and enhanced products 
our financial performance depends in large part on our ability to successfully develop and market next generation and new products in a rapidly changing technological environment 
if we fail to successfully identify new product opportunities and timely develop and introduce new products  obtain design wins  and achieve market acceptance  we may lose our market share and our future revenues and earnings may suffer 
in the consumer electronics market  our performance has been dependent on our successful development and timely introduction of integrated circuits for dvd players  digital cameras  digital televisions  multimedia accelerators for mobile phones  set top boxes and digital imaging products 
these markets are characterized by the incorporation of a steadily increasing level of integration and numbers of features on a chip at the same or 
table of contents lower system cost  enabling oems  to continually improve the features or reduce the prices of the systems they sell 
if we are unable to continually develop and introduce integrated circuits with increasing levels of integration and new features at competitive prices  our operating results will suffer 
in the imaging market  our performance has been dependent on our successful development and timely introduction of integrated circuits for printers and multi function peripherals 
these markets are characterized by the incorporation of a steadily increasing level of integration and higher speeds on a chip at the same or lower system cost  enabling oems to improve the performance and features or reduce the prices of the systems they sell 
if we are unable to develop and introduce integrated circuits with increasing levels of integration  performance and new features at competitive prices  our operating results will suffer 
the performance of our imaging software licensing business is dependent on our ability to develop and introduce new releases of our software  which incorporate new or enhanced printing standards  as well as performance enhancements required by our oem customers 
if we are unable to develop and release versions of our software supporting required standards and offering enhanced performance  our operating results will suffer 
we face competition or potential competition from companies with greater resources than ours  and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies  our market share may decline and our business could be harmed 
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  declining average unit selling prices and rapid product obsolescence 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with solutions that may be less costly or provide higher performance or more desirable features than our products 
competition typically occurs at the design stage  when customers evaluate alternative design approaches requiring integrated circuits 
because of short product life cycles  there are frequent design win competitions for next generation systems 
our existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing  personnel  technological  market  distribution and other resources 
these competitors may also have broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers and suppliers than we have 
many of our competitors are located in countries where our customers are located  such as china  japan  korea and taiwan  which may give them an advantage in securing business from these customers 
some of our principal competitors maintain their own semiconductor foundries and may therefore benefit from capacity  cost and technical advantages 
our principal competitors in the integrated audio and video devices for dvd applications include mediatek and sunplus technology co 
ltd 
in the digital camera market  our principal competitors are in house solutions developed and used by major japanese oems  as well as products sold by ambarella  fujitsu  novatech  sunplus inc and texas instruments  inc in the market for multimedia acceleration for mobile phones  our principal competitors include broadcom corp  corelogic  mtekvision co 
ltd  nvidia and telechips inc our principal competitors for digital semiconductor devices in the digital television market include broadcom corp  m star  mediatek  st microelectronics and trident microsystems  inc competitors in the printer and multifunction peripheral space include adobe  conexant systems  inc  global graphics  marvell semiconductor  inc and in house captive suppliers 
the dvd player market has slowed  and continued competition will lead to further price reductions and reduced profit margins 
we also face significant competition in the dtv  digital imaging and digital camera markets 
the future growth of these markets is highly dependent on oems continuing to outsource chip supply and an increasing portion of their product development work rather than doing it in house 
many of our existing competitors  as well as oem customers that are expected to compete with us in the future  have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we have 
in addition  much of our future success is dependent 
table of contents on the success of our oem customers 
if we or our oem customers are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors  we could experience price reductions  order cancellations and reduced gross margins  any one of which could harm our business 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration  which may result in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards and our customers changing demands 
the consumer electronics market  in particular  is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and increasing demand for higher levels of performance and integration 
our ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards  and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards  will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
if new industry standards emerge  our products or the products of our customers could become unmarketable or obsolete  and we could lose market share or be required to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards 
our success will also depend on the successful development of new markets and the application and acceptance of new technologies and products in those new markets 
for example  our success will depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance existing products in the digital television and set top box markets and to introduce and promote those products successfully 
these markets may not continue to develop to the extent or in the time periods that we currently anticipate due to factors outside our control 
if new markets do not develop as we anticipate  or if our products or those of our customers do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
the emergence of new markets for our products is also dependent in part upon third parties developing and marketing content in a format compatible with commercial and consumer products that incorporate our products 
if this content is not available  manufacturers may not be able to sell products incorporating our products  and our sales would suffer 
our new frame rate conversion technology remains unproven and our financial results and ability to compete could be harmed 
through our acquisition of let it wave in june  we acquired a frame rate conversion technology  for which we completed development in june our competitors may develop a superior performance image processing technology 
if we cannot successfully market and sell our frame rate conversion technology  we will not be able to recoup our costs of acquiring let it wave or our development costs for this technology  and our financial results and ability to compete would be harmed 
we rely on independent foundries and contractors for the manufacture  assembly and testing of our integrated circuits and other hardware products  and the failure of any of these third parties to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers and harm our sales and financial results 
we do not own or operate an assembly  fabrication or test facility 
we rely on independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of our products 
these independent foundries fabricate products for other companies and may also produce products of their own design 
availability of foundry capacity has at times in the past been  and may in the future be  reduced due to strong demand 
additionally  due to the recent global economic environment it is possible that our foundry subcontractors could experience financial difficulties that would impede their ability to operate effectively 
if we are unable to secure sufficient capacity at our existing foundries  or in the event of a closure at any of these foundries  our product revenue  cost of product revenue and results of operations would be negatively impacted 

table of contents we do not have long term supply contracts with any of our suppliers  including our principal supplier  tsmc  and our principal assembly houses 
therefore  tsmc and our other suppliers are not obligated to manufacture products for us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specified price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
our reliance on independent foundries involves a number of risks  including inability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity  inability to cancel orders after the submission of binding purchase orders  unavailability or interruption of access to certain process technologies necessary for manufacture of our products  lack of control over delivery schedules  lack of control over quality assurance  lack of control over manufacturing yields and cost  difficulties in managing these foundries due to our limited personnel and other resources in the countries in which they are located  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  tsmc and some of our other foundries are located in areas of the world that are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes 
while the earthquake in taiwan did not have a material impact on our independent foundries  a similar event centered near tsmc s facility could severely reduce tsmc s ability to manufacture our integrated circuits 
the loss of any of our manufacturers as a supplier  our inability to expand the supply of their products in response to increased demand  or our inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from our current or future suppliers due to a natural disaster or any other reason could delay or reduce shipments of our products 
any of these circumstances could damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our sales and financial results 
we also rely on a limited number of independent contractors for the assembly and testing of our products 
our reliance on independent assembly and testing houses limits our control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and product cost 
disruptions in the services provided by our assembly or testing houses or other circumstances that would require us to seek alternative sources of assembly or testing could lead to supply constraints or delays in the delivery of our products 
these constraints or delays could damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our financial results 
because foundry capacity is limited from time to time  we may be required to enter into costly long term supply arrangements to secure foundry capacity 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  our relationships with our customers would be harmed and our sales would be reduced 
in order to secure additional foundry capacity  we have considered  and may in the future need to consider  various arrangements with suppliers  which could include  among other things option payments or other prepayments to a foundry  nonrefundable deposits with or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity commitments  contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of silicon wafers over extended periods  issuance of our equity securities to a foundry  investment in a foundry  joint ventures  or other partnership relationships with foundries 

table of contents we may not be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all  and such arrangements  if any  may be expensive and may not be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  if we are able to secure foundry capacity  we may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties 
excess capacity could lead to write downs of excess inventory  which could harm our financial results 
such penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results 
if our independent foundries do not achieve satisfactory yields  our relationships with our customers may be harmed 
the fabrication of silicon wafers is a complex process 
small levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  defects in photo masks used to print circuits on a wafer  difficulties in the fabrication process or other factors can cause a substantial portion of the integrated circuits on a wafer to be non functional 
many of these problems are difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and may be time consuming and expensive to correct 
as a result  foundries often experience problems achieving acceptable yields  which are represented by the number of good integrated circuits as a proportion of the number of total integrated circuits on any particular wafer 
poor yields from our independent foundries would reduce our ability to deliver our products to customers  harm our relationships with our customers and harm our business 
we are dependent upon our international sales and operations  economic  political or military events in a country where we make significant sales or have significant operations could interfere with our success or operations there and harm our business 
during and  of our total revenues were derived outside of north america 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
substantially all of our semiconductor products are manufactured  assembled and tested outside of the united states by independent foundries and subcontractors 
we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally  including operating in countries where we have limited or no experience  and limited personnel and other resources  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  fluctuations in exchange rates  political and economic instability  armed conflicts or other crises  earthquakes  floods and health epidemics  imposition of tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and health risks in a particular region 
a material amount of our research and development personnel and facilities and a portion of our marketing personnel are located in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations 
for example  increased violence or armed conflict in israel or the palestinian territories may disrupt travel and communications in the region  harming our operations there 
furthermore  some of our employees in israel are obligated to perform up to days of military reserve duty annually and may be called to active duty in a time of crisis 
the absence of these employees for significant periods may cause us to operate inefficiently during these periods 

table of contents our operations in china are subject to the economic and political uncertainties affecting that country 
for example  the chinese economy has experienced significant growth in the past decade  but such growth has been uneven across geographic and economic sectors and may not be sustained 
if asia  particularly china  fails to continue its recent growth  or even contracts  this could harm our oem and odm customers based in asia and cause them to purchase fewer products from us for shipment to china  the rest of asia and globally 
in addition  asia consumers may purchase fewer products sold by our oem customers containing our products  and we may experience disruptions in our operations in asia  which could harm our business and financial results 
we also maintain offices in france  germany  india  japan  korea  sweden  taiwan and the united kingdom  and our operations are subject to the economic and political uncertainties affecting these countries as well 
the significant concentration of our manufacturing activities with third party foundries in taiwan exposes us to the risk of political instability in taiwan  including the potential for conflict between taiwan and china 
we have several significant oem customers in japan  korea and other parts of asia 
adverse economic circumstances in asia could affect these customers willingness or ability to do business with us in the future or their success in developing and launching devices containing our products 
the complexity of our international operations may increase our operating expenses and disrupt our revenues and business 
we transact business and have operations worldwide 
for example  international transactions account for a substantial majority of our sales  our semiconductor products are manufactured  assembled and tested outside of the united states 
our global operations involve significant complexity and difficulties  including monitoring and complying with applicable laws and regulatory requirements  staffing and managing global operations  complying with statutory equity requirements  and managing tax consequences 
managing international operations is expensive and complex 
if we are unable to manage the complexity of our global operations successfully and cost effectively  our financial performance and operating results could suffer 
our business may be impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations 
foreign currency fluctuations may affect the prices of our products 
prices for our products are currently denominated in united states dollars for sales to our customers throughout the world 
if there is a significant devaluation of the currency in a specific country  the prices of our products will increase relative to that country s currency  our products may be less competitive in that country and our revenues may be adversely affected 
also  we cannot be sure that our international customers will continue to be willing to place orders denominated in united states dollars 
if they do not  our revenue and operating results will be subject to foreign exchange fluctuations  which we may not be able to successfully manage 
a portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities is incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  we bear the risk that the rate of inflation in those foreign countries or the decline in value of the united states dollar compared to those foreign currencies will increase our costs as expressed in united states dollars 
to date  we have not engaged in hedging transactions 
in the future  we may enter into currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against foreign currencies 
these measures may not adequately protect us from the impact of inflation or currency fluctuation in foreign countries 

table of contents because we have significant operations in israel  our business and future operating results could be harmed by terrorist activity or military conflict 
we conduct a significant portion of our research and development and engineering activities at our design center in haifa  israel  a  square foot facility where we employ people 
we also conduct a portion of our sales and marketing operations at our haifa facility 
any armed conflict affecting israel could greatly disrupt our israeli operations locally and as a result hinder our business generally by delaying product development or interfering with global marketing efforts 
for example  as a result of the heightened military operations in gaza  some of our employees were conscripted for several weeks ending in january additional employees may be called to active duty in the future 
extended absences could disrupt our operations and delay product development cycles 
in addition  military conflict in the middle east or terrorist activities there or elsewhere in the world could harm our business as a result of a disruption in commercial activity affecting international commerce or a general economic slowdown and reduced demand for consumer electronic products 
changes in  or different interpretations of  tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations 
our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws  by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates  by changes in the geography of our income or losses  or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the ultimate outcomes of any future tax audits are uncertain  and we can give no assurance as to whether an adverse result from one or more of them will have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
our products could contain defects  which could reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us 
we develop complex and evolving products 
despite testing by us  our manufacturers and customers  errors may be found in existing or new products 
this could result in  among other things  a delay in recognition or loss of revenues  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
these defects may cause us to incur significant warranty  support and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with our customers 
the occurrence of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business 
defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could result in financial or other damages to customers or could damage market acceptance of such products 
our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
regulation of our customers products may slow the process of introducing new products and could impair our ability to compete 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  has broad jurisdiction over our target markets in the digital television and mobile phone business 
various international entities or organizations may also regulate aspects of our business or the business of our customers 
although our products are not directly subject to regulation by any agency  the transmission pipes  as well as much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated  are subject to direct government regulation 
for example  before they can be sold in the united states  advanced televisions and emerging interactive displays must be tested and certified by underwriters laboratories and meet fcc regulations 
accordingly  the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which our customers operate may in turn harm our business 
in addition  our digital television and digital 
table of contents camera businesses may also be adversely affected by the imposition of tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on our suppliers or by the imposition of export restrictions on products that we sell internationally 
changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations in the united states or elsewhere could harm our business 
our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protection of our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
these agreements and measures may not be sufficient to protect our technology from third party infringement  or to protect us from the claims of others 
monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
the protection offered by patents is uncertain 
for example  our competitors may be able to effectively design around our patents  or the patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
those competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology and may obtain patents that restrict our business 
moreover  while we hold  or have applied for  patents relating to the design of our products  some of our products are based in part on standards  for which we do not hold patents or other intellectual property rights 
we have generally limited access to and distribution of the source and object code of our software and other proprietary information 
with respect to our page description language software  system on a chip platform firmware and drivers for the digital office market and in limited circumstances with respect to firmware and platforms for our dtv products  we grant licenses that give our customers access to and restricted use of the source code of our software 
this access increases the likelihood of misappropriation or misuse of our technology 
claims and litigation regarding intellectual property rights and breach of contract claims could seriously harm our business and require us to incur significant costs 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
in the past  we have been subject to claims and litigation regarding alleged infringement of other parties intellectual property rights  and we have been party to a number of patent related lawsuits  both as plaintiff and defendant 
we could become subject to additional litigation in the future  either to protect our intellectual property or as a result of allegations that we infringe others intellectual property rights or have breached our contractual obligations to others 
claims that our products infringe proprietary rights or that we have breached contractual obligations would force us to defend ourselves and possibly our customers or manufacturers against the alleged infringement or breach 
future litigation against us  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages  restrict or prohibit the sale of our products or invalidate our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  are time consuming and expensive to resolve and require significant management time and attention 
our costs and potential liability are increased to the extent we have to indemnify or otherwise defend our customers 
future intellectual property and breach of contract litigation could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  
table of contents pay damages  or redesign those products that use such technology 
although patent disputes in the semiconductor industry have often been settled through cross licensing arrangements  we may not be able to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
we have a more limited patent portfolio than many of our competitors 
if a successful claim is made against us or any of our customers and a license is not made available to us on commercially reasonable terms  we are restricted in or prevented from selling our products or we are required to pay substantial damages or awards  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed 
if necessary licenses of third party technology are not available to us or are very expensive  our products could become obsolete 
from time to time  we may be required to license technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements 
third party licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain any third party license required to develop new products and product enhancements  we may have to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  either of which could seriously harm the competitiveness of our products 
we rely on licenses to use various technologies that are material to our products 
we do not own the patents that underlie these licenses 
our rights to use these technologies and employ the inventions claimed in the licensed patents are subject to our abiding by the terms of the licenses 
under the license agreements we must fulfill confidentiality obligations and pay royalties 
if we fail to abide by the terms of the license  we would be unable to sell and market the products under license 
in addition  we do not control the prosecution of the patents subject to this license or the strategy for determining when such patents should be enforced 
as a result  we are dependent upon our licensor to determine the appropriate strategy for prosecuting and enforcing those patents 
if we are not able to apply our net operating losses against taxable income in future periods  our financial results will be harmed 
our future net income and cash flow will be affected by our ability to apply our net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  against taxable income in future periods 
our nols totaled approximately million for federal  million for state and million for foreign tax reporting purposes as of december  the internal revenue code contains a number of provisions that limit the use of nols under certain circumstances 
changes in tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions may further limit our ability to utilize our nols 
any further limitation on our ability to utilize these respective nols could harm our financial condition 
any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and severely harm our financial condition 
we have made investments in  and acquisitions of other complementary companies  products and technologies  and we may acquire additional businesses  products or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  use a significant amount of our cash  assume liabilities  incur expenses related to the future impairment of goodwill and the amortization of intangible assets  or incur other large write offs immediately or in the future 

table of contents our operation of acquired business will also involve numerous risks  including problems combining the purchased operations  technologies or products  acquisition of unproven technologies under development  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  harm to existing business relationships with customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organizations 
we may not be able to successfully complete the integration of acquired in process products  technologies or personnel and any failure to do so could disrupt our business  cause us to not achieve the intended benefits of the acquisition  and seriously harm our financial condition 
if we fail to manage our future growth  if any  our business would be harmed 
we anticipate that our future growth  if any  will require us to recruit and hire a substantial number of new engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
our ability to manage growth successfully will also require us to expand and improve administrative  operational  management and financial systems and controls 
many of our key functions  including a material portion of our research and development  product operations and a significant portion of our marketing  sales and administrative operations are located in israel 
a majority of our sales and marketing and certain of our research and development and administrative personnel  including our president and chief executive officer and other officers  are based in the united states 
the geographic separation of these operations places additional strain on our resources and our ability to manage growth effectively 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business will be harmed 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates 
at the end of december  we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  money market funds  auction rate securities ars and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
at december   we held ars with a par value of million 
historically  our ars were highly liquid  using a dutch auction process that reset the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every days  to provide liquidity at par 
however  as a result of liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets  the auctions for all of our ars failed beginning in the first quarter of  when sell orders exceeded buy orders 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of our ars at favorable pricing  or at all 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded equity investments and debt instruments is judged to be other than temporary 
we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale  generally no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity 
recent events in the subprime mortgage market and with ars could negatively impact our return on investment for these debt securities and thereby reduce the amount of cash and cash equivalents and long term investments on our balance sheet 

table of contents we rely on the services of our executive officers and other key personnel  whose knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our senior management 
we do not have employment contracts with any of our key employees 
management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time upon short or no notice 
the loss of key personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise harm our business 
we believe that our future success will also depend in large part on our ability to attract  integrate and retain highly skilled engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel  located in the united states and overseas 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting  integrating and retaining such personnel 
failure to attract  integrate and retain key personnel could harm our ability to carry out our business strategy and compete with other companies 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of zoran 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these include provisions prohibiting a merger with a party that has acquired control of or more of our outstanding common stock  such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer  until three years after that party acquired control of of our outstanding common stock  authorizing the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock  eliminating stockholders rights to call a special meeting of stockholders  and requiring advance notice of any stockholder nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors and for other stockholder proposals 
our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering in between january  and december   the sale prices of our common stock  as reported on the nasdaq global select market  ranged from a low of to a high of 
the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in the future in response to a variety of factors  including announcements concerning our business or that of our competitors or customers  annual and quarterly variations in our operating results  failure to meet our guidance or analyst estimates  changes in analysts earnings estimates  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by zoran or its competitors  loss of key personnel  proprietary rights or other litigation  general conditions in the semiconductor industry  and developments in the financial markets 
from time to time  the stock market experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for semiconductor companies or technology companies generally and which have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
broad market fluctuations of this type may reduce the future market price of our common stock

overview we provide integrated circuits  software and platforms for digital televisions  digital cameras  set top boxes  dvd and hd media players  and digital imaging products  consisting of semiconductor hardware and software that enable printing  scanning  processing and transmission of documents to computer peripherals that perform printing functions 
our products are used by the oems for consumer and commercial applications 
starting in the second half of  our revenues were harmed by the deteriorating macroeconomic environment which had the effect of reducing consumer spending 
as a result of those deteriorating conditions  we implemented several cost containment programs including realigning our resources to focus on our key priorities  reducing investments in certain areas  generally eliminating salary increases and scaling back travel  as well as other measures 
in addition  we renewed our focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet  and in particular  managing our cash and inventory balances very closely 
while the global economic downturn continues to affect consumer spending  we are seeing some indications that it may be stabilizing 
in  we saw growth in our dtv product line as a result of increased demand for low to mid range lcd tvs where we have a strong market position 
also  we had growth in our digital camera product line as a result of increased demand for low to mid range models 
while we have seen some recent strength in demand for certain of our products  consumer spending has not yet reached previous levels and we are continuing several of the cost containment measures previously mentioned 
revenues we derive most of our revenues from the sale of our integrated circuit and system on a chip products 
historically  average selling prices for our products  consistent with average selling prices for products in the semiconductor industry generally  have decreased over time 
average selling prices for our products have fluctuated substantially from period to period  reflecting changes in our mix of product sold and transitions from low volume to high volume production 
in the past  we have periodically reduced the prices of some of our products in order to better penetrate the consumer market 
we believe that as our product lines continue to mature and competitive markets evolve  we are likely to experience further declines in the average selling prices of our products  although we cannot predict the timing and amount of such future changes with any certainty 
we also derive revenues from licensing our software and other intellectual property 
licensing revenues include one time license fees and royalties based on the number of units sold by the licensee 
quarterly licensing revenues can be significantly affected by the timing of a small number of licensing transactions  each accounting for substantial revenues 
accordingly  licensing revenues have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  on a quarterly basis 
our software license agreements typically include obligations to provide maintenance and other support over a fixed term and allow for renewal of maintenance services on an annual basis 
we determine the 
table of contents fair value of our maintenance obligations with reference to substantive renewal rates within the agreement or objective evidence of fair value 
in instances where we are unable to determine the fair value of our maintenance obligations  revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
we recognize maintenance and support revenue ratably over the term of the arrangement 
we also receive royalty revenues based on per unit shipments of products that include our software  which we recognize upon receipt of a royalty report from the customer  typically one quarter after the sales are made by our licensee 
we also generate a portion of our revenues from development contracts  primarily with key customers 
revenues from development contracts are generally recognized as the services are performed based on the specific deliverables outlined in each contract 
amounts received in advance of performance under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue and are generally recognized within one year from receipt 
cost of hardware product revenues our cost of hardware product revenues consists primarily of fabrication costs  assembly and test costs  the cost of materials and overhead from operations and allocable facilities costs 
if we are unable to reduce our cost of hardware product revenues to offset anticipated decreases in average selling prices  our product gross margins will decrease 
we expect both product and customer mix to continue to fluctuate in future periods  causing fluctuations in margins 
research and development our research and development expenses consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities costs of engineering materials and supplies and allocable facilities costs 
we believe that significant investments in research and development are required for us to remain competitive  and we expect to continue to devote significant resources to product development  although such expenses as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  sales commissions  product promotion  other professional services and allocable facilities costs 
income taxes our global effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses as our statutory tax rate varies significantly by jurisdiction 
our current tax expense reflects taxes expected to be owed in our profitable jurisdictions 
in addition  due to economic changes in the global economy during and  we identified certain foreign jurisdictions where it is no longer more likely than not that we will fully utilize our deferred tax assets  and we continue to record a valuation allowance on the portion of our deferred tax assets for which future income is uncertain 
the determination of when to record or remove a valuation allowance is highly subjective and is done by jurisdiction 
we rely primarily on an analysis of cumulative earnings or losses and projected future earnings or losses 
it is possible that we will remove or record a valuation allowance on these or other jurisdictions in the near future dependent primarily on the actual and projected results in each jurisdiction 
our israeli subsidiary is an approved enterprise under israeli law  which provides a ten year tax holiday for income attributable to a portion of our operations in israel

table of contents acquisition on june   we completed the acquisition of let it wave  a fabless development stage semiconductor company based in paris  france 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we acquired let it wave in an all cash transaction valued at million including approximately  of transaction costs 
we also agreed to make contingent payments of up to million in additional consideration  contingent upon completion of certain milestones  a portion of which was subject to continuous employment and was to be expensed as incurred 
the milestones were not achieved and thus there were no payments in relation to the milestones 
the balance of  related to continuous employment will continue to be expensed as incurred through we recorded an in process research and development expense of million in connection with the acquisition 
the primary purpose of the acquisition was to obtain let it wave s in process development of video frame rate conversion and image enhancement technology for flat panel televisions and other consumer electronics 
by acquiring let it wave  we intend to deliver high performance image processing that enables artifact free  true motion compensated frame rate conversion mcfrc for flat panel televisions and other video consumer electronics products 
let it wave currently has no other products  revenues or a customer base 
the development of the in process technology was completed in the second quarter of as anticipated 
we are utilizing this technology for hz lcd televisions within the consumer group 
we accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets and determining whether a nonmonetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business 
following the completion of the acquisition  the results of operations of let it wave have been included in our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  our results of operations for the year ended december  and include let it wave s operations from the acquisition date 
segments our products consist of application specific integrated circuits  or asics  and system on a chip  or soc  products 
we also license certain software and other intellectual property 
we operate in two operating segments consumer and imaging 
the consumer group provides products for use in dvd and multimedia players products  standard and high definition digital television products  digital cameras and multimedia mobile phones 
the imaging group provides products used in digital copiers  laser and inkjet printers  and multifunction peripherals 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including bad debt  inventories  investments  intangible assets and income taxes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies require our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
we write down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions 
inventory write downs are not reversed and permanently reduce the cost basis of the affected inventory until such inventory is sold or scrapped 
we assess the valuation of our inventory in each reporting period 
although we attempt to forecast future inventory demand  given the competitive pressures and cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  there may be significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments that could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
inventory write downs inherently involve judgments as to assumptions about expected future demand and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
although we believe that the assumptions we used in estimating inventory write downs are reasonable  significant changes in any one of the assumptions in the future could produce a significantly different result 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
there can be no assurances that future events and changing market conditions will not result in significant increases in inventory write downs 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the delays or inability of certain customers to make required payments 
these allowances are estimated based on specific identification of facts and circumstances with respect to each doubtful account 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment  at a minimum  on an annual basis as of september th and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets may not be recoverable due to factors indicating a decrease in the value of the company  such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization  reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry 
estimates of future cash flows are based in part on an updated long term financial outlook of our operations 
however  actual performance in the near term or long term could be materially different from these forecasts  which could impact future estimates 
for example  a significant decline in our stock price and or market capitalization may result in goodwill and intangible assets impairment 
in addition  the other assumptions made by us may change in future periods as they are based on overall market conditions and or comparable company data 
a change in the assumptions used to determine if goodwill and intangible assets are impaired may result in a charge to earnings in our financial statements during a period in which an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets is determined to exist  which may negatively impact our results of operations 
impairment is tested at the reporting unit level which is one level below the reportable segments 
the consumer segment has two reporting units home entertainment and mobile  and the imaging segment has one reporting unit 
the first step step is performed by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill and intangible assets  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill and intangible assets is considered impaired and a second step step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
step is performed by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill and intangible assets and comparing the implied fair value to the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets 
if the implied fair value of goodwill and intangible assets is lower than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 
in  we determined that goodwill and intangible assets related to our reporting units in the consumer segment were fully impaired and recorded a million impairment charge 
in  we performed our annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment analysis as of september  and 
table of contents determined that the fair value of our imaging segment exceeded its carrying amount and concluded that goodwill and intangible assets were not impaired at that date 
we have accounted for stock based compensation under authoritative accounting guidance for share based payment which requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
the black scholes option pricing model that we use was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of underlying stock 
our expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of our common stock 
we determined that historical volatility reflects market conditions and is a good indicator of future volatility 
our expected term represents the period that our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on our historical experience with similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards and vesting schedules 
see notes and to consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 
we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies 
we accrue for contingent liabilities when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and that the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated 
see note to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  for a detailed description 
we follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequence of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
realization of deferred tax assets is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
the retention of our valuation allowance in certain foreign jurisdictions in was determined in accordance with the provisions of authoritative accounting guidance regarding accounting for income taxes which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
recent operating results and continuing uncertainty about projected income represent sufficient negative evidence that we continue to believe that it is more likely than not that some of our deferred tax assets will not be realized and accordingly  a valuation allowance was recorded against those assets 
we recognize and derecognize uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not threshold 
we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a more likely than not potential of success upon settlement 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we record liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes may be due 
actual tax liabilities may be different than the recorded estimates and could result in an additional charge or benefit to the tax provision in the period when the ultimate tax assessment is determined 
we are currently under a tax audit in israel for tax years through and the california franchise tax board for tax years and we believe that we have adequately provided for any potential assessments associated with these audits 
it is possible that the amount of our liability for unrecognized income tax benefits may change within the next months 
in addition  our income tax expense could be affected as other events occur  income tax audits conclude or statutes of limitations expire 
we cannot estimate at this time the range of possible variations in our tax expense 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
with respect to mergers and acquisitions  we capitalize the fair value of acquired in process research and development as an indefinite lived intangible asset until completion or abandonment of the associated project 
upon project completion  the in process research and development asset is accounted for as a finite lived intangible asset and amortized over the related product s estimated useful life 
if the project is abandoned  the asset is expensed immediately if there is no alternative 
table of contents future use for it 
any cost incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred 
the intangible asset value is generally estimated based upon the projected fair value of the technology  as determined by a discounted future cash flow reduced by the cost to complete 
this analysis includes certain estimates and assumptions made by management 
for larger acquisitions  we have historically engaged an external appraiser to assist with the assumptions and models used in this analysis 
we account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value 
the hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value is the observable in the market 
the company categorizes each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
these levels are level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level consists of publicly traded equity securities which are valued primarily using quoted market prices utilizing market observable inputs as they are traded in an active market with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions 
level includes fixed income securities other than auction rate securities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets 
level our investments in auction rate securities are classified within level because there are no active markets for the auction rate securities and therefore we are unable to obtain independent valuations from market sources 
we estimated the fair value of the ars using the income approach based on the following i the underlying structure and contractual provisions of each security  ii the present value of future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions  and iii consideration of the probabilities of default  auction failure  or repurchase at par for each period 
our ars are high grade long term debt instruments backed by student loans which are guaranteed by the united states government 
all of our ars have credit ratings of aaa or aa  and none are mortgage backed debt obligations 
we also hold series c auction rate securities rights ars rights that entitle us to sell our eligible ars to ubs affiliates during the period from june  to july  for a price equal to par value 
in exchange for the issuance of the ars rights  the ubs affiliates have the discretionary right to sell our eligible ars on our behalf  without prior notification  at any time during a two year period beginning june  the total fair value of the ars  combined with the fair value of the ars rights  approximates the par value of the ars 
we measure the ars rights at fair value under the financial instruments overall scope section of the fasb accounting standards codification asc  which permits an entity to elect the fair value option for recognized financial assets  in order to match the changes in the fair value of the related ars 
as a result  unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings in future periods 
we expect that future changes in the fair value of the ars rights will approximate fair value movements in the related ars 
we valued the ars rights using a discounted cash flow approach including estimates based on data available as of december   of interest rates  timing and amount of cash flow  adjusted for any bearer risk associated with the financial ability of ubs to repurchase the ars beginning june  these assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change 
due to the current economic environment in which there is a lack of market activity for ars  we have been unable to obtain quoted prices or market prices for identical assets as of the measurement date resulting in significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value 
we estimated the fair value of the ars using the income approach based on the following i the underlying structure and contractual provisions of each security  ii the present value of future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions  and iii consideration of the probabilities of default  auction failure  or repurchase at par 
table of contents for each period 
these estimated fair values could change significantly based on future market conditions  which could result in recognizing an other than temporary impairment loss 
after determining the fair value of our available for sales debt instruments  gains or losses on these securities are recorded to other comprehensive income  until either the security is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary 
the primary differentiating factors considered by us to classify our impairments between temporary and other than temporary impairments are our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  the length of the time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
given the current market conditions  these judgments could prove to be wrong  and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations 
we recorded  other than temporary impairment otti charges on our available for sale securities and we did not record any otti charges during and as of december  and  our cumulative unrealized gains losses  net of tax  related to our investments classified as available for sale was approximately million and million  respectively 
these unrecognized gains losses could be recognized in the future if our other than temporary assessment changes

hardware product revenues for dtv products increased by million or 
total dtv product units shipped increased by and the average selling price increased by compared to the decrease in imaging hardware product revenues was primarily due to a decrease in unit shipments attributable to a decline in our ink jet business as well as an overall decline in demand as a result of the economic downturn 
we believe that the recent worldwide recession has adversely affected the markets that our customers serve resulting in reduced unit shipments for some of our products during as indicated above

at december   we had approximately million in net intangible assets acquired through the let it wave acquisition  which we will continue to amortize on a straight line basis through impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in  as a result of our annual impairment test  we determined that the carrying amount of certain reporting units exceeded their fair value resulting in an impairment charge of million related to goodwill recorded in our consumer business segment and million related to intangible assets in our consumer business segment 
in process research and development in  we recorded an in process research and development expense of million as part of the june acquisition of let it wave 
the in process research and development has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use 
accordingly the amount allocated to in process research and 
table of contents development was immediately expensed upon the acquisition date 
the value of in process research and development was determined using the multi period excess earnings method by estimating the expected net cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 
this rate was based on the industry segment for the technology  nature of the products to be developed  relative risk of successful development  time value of money  length of time to complete the project and overall maturity and history of the development team 
there have been no material variations from the underlying assumptions that were used in the original computation of the value of the acquired entity 
the development of the in process technology was completed in the second quarter of as anticipated 
we are utilizing this technology for hz lcd televisions within the consumer group 
there were no charges recorded for in process research and development in interest and other income interest and other income was million in compared to million in interest income was million in compared to million in the decrease in interest income in was primarily due to lower average interest earned on our cash and short term investment balances due to declines in the interest rate 
interest and other income  net during the year ended december  included a gain of million from rights offered by ubs  largely offset by the losses recorded on the auction rate securities from ubs due to a reclassification of these securities from available for sale to trading 
other expense was million in compared to million in the changes in other expense in compared to was primarily due to foreign currency remeasurement losses as a result of the decline in the value of the us dollar in comparison to currencies in countries in which we operate and fluctuations in realized gains due to timing of sale of investments 
other expense in included a write down of a long term equity investment in a private company by million 
provision benefit for income taxes we recorded a tax provision of million in compared to a tax benefit of million in the provision is primarily for the accrual of taxes we expect to owe in our profitable jurisdictions and an expense of million associated with a valuation allowance in foreign jurisdictions where it is no longer more likely than not that we will fully utilize our deferred tax assets 
in addition  due to statute of limitations lapses in various jurisdictions  there was a release of approximately million of our asc liability 
the tax benefit for the year ended december  of million included a benefit of million  net of provision  from the release of the valuation allowance at december  the income tax provision benefit for these periods was affected by the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings and losses  the impacts of recording or removing the valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets  non deductible expenses such as asc compensation stock compensation  as well as the accrual of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits 
our israel based subsidiary is an approved enterprise under israeli law  which provides a ten year tax holiday for income attributable to a portion of our operations in israel 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term investments and million of working capital 
our operating activities generated cash of million during while we recorded a net loss of million  this loss included non cash items such as amortization of intangible assets of million  depreciation of million  stock based compensation expense of million and deferred income taxes of million 
table of contents resulting in our net loss adjusted for non cash items totaling million 
cash flow from changes in assets and liabilities was insignificant and was due to decreases in accounts receivable by million due to the timing of collections  inventory by million due to lower levels based on reduced demand and prepaid expenses  other current assets and other assets by million due to the timing of payments made 
these changes were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities totaling million due to timing of payments

at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to the type of financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we believe that our current balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and anticipated cash flows from operations  will satisfy our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through the next months 
nonetheless  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend on many factors including  but not limited to the levels at which we maintain inventories and accounts receivable  the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch our new products or to enter markets and attain a competitive position in the marketplace  
table of contents our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and technology roadmap  volume pricing concessions  capital improvements  technological advances  the response of competitors to our products  and our relationships with suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require an increase in the level of working capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring and infrastructure needs 
additional capital may also be required for additional acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies 
to the extent that our existing resources and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or borrowings 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
at december  we held ars with a par value of million and a fair value of million 
during the year ended december   we sold million of our ars at par value 
our ars are high grade long term debt instruments backed by student loans which are guaranteed by the united states government 
all of our ars have credit ratings of aaa or aa  and none are mortgage backed debt obligations 
we also hold series c auction rate securities rights ars rights that entitle us to sell our eligible ars to ubs affiliates during the period from june  to july  for a price equal to par value 
in exchange for the issuance of the ars rights  the ubs affiliates have the discretionary right to sell our eligible ars on our behalf  without prior notification  at any time during a two year period beginning june  the total fair value of the ars  combined with the fair value of the ars rights  approximates the par value of the ars 
we intend to exercise our ars right on june  and as a result  have classified these ars as short term investments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our investment policy focuses on three objectives to preserve capital  to meet liquidity requirements and to maximize total return 
our investment policy establishes minimum ratings for each classification of investment and investment concentration is limited in order to minimize risk  and the policy also limits the final maturity on any investment and the overall duration of the portfolio 
given the overall market conditions  we regularly review our investment portfolio to ensure adherence to our investment policy and to monitor individual investments for risk analysis and proper valuation 
we hold our marketable securities as trading and available for sale and mark them to market 
we expect to realize the full value of our marketable securities upon maturity or sale  as we have the intent and believe we have the ability to hold the securities until the full value is realized 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that our invested cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets  which may require us to record an impairment charge that could adversely impact our financial results 

table of contents contractual obligations the following is a summary of fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases commitments purchase commitments total our contracts with our suppliers generally require us to provide purchase order commitments that are generally binding and cannot be canceled 
we lease many of our office facilities for various terms under long term  noncancelable operating lease agreements 
the leases expire at various dates from fiscal year through fiscal year the following is a summary of other long term liabilities  primarily related to certain contractual obligations as of december  in thousands other long term liabilities total less than year years years more than years severance obligations see note income tax liability deferred rent other long term liabilities total other commitments the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million as a disallowance of these items would be primarily reflected as an adjustment to our deferred tax assets and would not result in a significant impact on our cash balance 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we hold our marketable securities  other than the ars held with ubs  as available for sale and mark them to market 
we expect to realize the full value of all our marketable securities upon maturity or sale  as we have the intent and believe that we have the ability to hold the securities until the full value is realized 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that our invested cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets  which may require us to record an impairment charge that could adversely impact our financial results 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our fixed income securities and publicly traded equity securities  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 

table of contents interest rate risk we invest in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  money market funds  auction rate securities and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
we do not maintain derivative financial instruments 
we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities other than our ars with ubs are treated as available for sale 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because we generally classify our debt securities as available for sale no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio  the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a increase or decrease in interest rates 
actual future gains and losses associated with our investments may differ from the sensitivity analyses performed as of december  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and level of interest rates and our actual exposures and positions 
exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we recorded an exchange gain of  and a loss of million for and  respectively 
these fluctuations were primarily due to foreign currency remeasurement as a result of changes in the value of the us dollar in comparison to currencies in countries in which we operate 
currently  sales and supply arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices as a condition to their continuing to do business with us 
a portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities in israel  asia and europe  are transacted in foreign currencies 
to date  we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities  although we may do so in the future 
significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates could impact our business in the future 
however  a hypothetical favorable or unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
