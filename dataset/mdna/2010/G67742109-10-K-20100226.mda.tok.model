item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
statements that are not historical in nature are forward looking statements 
onebeacon cannot promise that its expectations in such forward looking statements will turn out to be correct 
onebeacon s actual results could be materially different from and worse than its expectations 
see forward looking statements on page for specific important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements 
the following discussion also includes three non gaap financial measures  adjusted book value per share  adjusted onebeacon s shareholders equity and loss and loss adjustment expenses ratio prior to reserve reallocation and total combined ratio prior to reserve reallocation that have been reconciled to their most comparable gaap financial measures see below and pages and 
onebeacon believes these measures to be useful supplements to the comparable gaap measures in evaluating onebeacon s financial performance 
book value and adjusted book value per share the following table presents our adjusted book value per share and reconciles this non gaap financial measure to its most comparable gaap measure 
as of december  in millions except per share amounts numerator onebeacon s shareholders equity remaining adjustment of subsidiary preferred stock to face value adjusted onebeacon s shareholders equity denominator common shares outstanding book value per share adjusted book value per share represents a non gaap financial measure 
includes the impact of repurchases of class a common shares made through the company s share repurchase program which commenced in the third quarter of book value per share december  versus december  we ended the full year with a book value per share of  reflecting a increase for the year ended december   including dividends 
the increase includes a total return on invested assets for the year ended december  we reported comprehensive net income attributable to onebeacon s shareholders of million in the year ended december   compared to a comprehensive net loss attributable to onebeacon s shareholders of million in the year ended december  the increase in comprehensive net income as compared to the prior year was due primarily to net realized and unrealized investment gains recognized in  as described below 
our results include pre tax proceeds of million  reflected in net other revenues  from the commercial lines transaction that was completed during the fourth quarter 
the increase in book value also includes the impact of a settlement reached with the internal revenue 
table of contents service in the fourth quarter of relating to the examination of our us income tax returns for and as a result of the settlement  the year ended december  includes a tax benefit in the statement of operations of million offset by a capital distribution of million reflected in shareholders equity 
the net effect of the settlement resulted in an increase to book value of million 
our gaap combined ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the combined ratio was primarily due to lower current accident year catastrophe losses  compared to the year ended december   which included million of catastrophe losses primarily related to hurricanes ike and gustav and catastrophe losses from tornados in the southeastern united states experienced in the first quarter of the year ended december  also included the benefit of slightly more favorable loss reserve development offset by higher expenses  including increased incentive compensation costs and severance and other costs associated with the renewal rights transaction described below 
total net written premiums decreased in the year ended december  to  million  compared to  million in the year ended december  the decrease in net written premiums is due primarily to decreases in personal lines in both traditional personal lines  mainly due to the homeowners quota share as described below  and lower premiums at autoone  as well as decreases in our non specialty middle market commercial businesses and small business division 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in specialty lines net written premiums driven primarily by our collector cars and boats business that we began writing in the second quarter of and ebi which we acquired in the third quarter of book value and adjusted book value per share december  versus december  we ended the full year with a book value per share of reflecting a decrease for the year ended december   adjusted for the defeasance of our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and including dividends 
the reduction was mainly due to a total return on invested assets for the year ended december  we reported comprehensive net loss of million in the year ended december   compared to comprehensive net income of million in the year ended december  our underwriting results although solid also contributed to the decline in book value per share and adjusted book value per share with a gaap combined ratio of for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the combined ratio was primarily due to million of catastrophe losses in the year ended december   primarily related to hurricanes ike and gustav and catastrophe losses from tornados in the southeastern united states experienced in the first quarter of total net written premiums increased in the year ended december  to  million  compared to  million in the year ended december   driven primarily by premiums from our new specialty collector car and boat business 
overview we provide a range of insurance products and services 
we have historically offered a range of specialty  commercial and personal products and services sold primarily through select independent agents and brokers 
however  we have recently entered into two transactions that will transform us into a specialty lines company 
on december   we sold the renewal rights to our non specialty commercial lines business and on february   we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our personal lines business 
with roots dating back to  we have been operating for more than years and have relationships with many independent agencies and brokers 
we consist of a group of operating companies which are us based property and casualty insurance writers  most of which operate in a multi company pool 
pooling arrangements permit the participating companies to rely on the capacity of the entire pool s capital and surplus rather than just on its own capital and surplus 

table of contents under such arrangements  the members share substantially all insurance business that is written  and allocate the combined premiums  losses and expenses 
in the year ended december   our net written premiums totaled billion and we had total assets of billion and total onebeacon s shareholders equity of billion at december  our segments our reportable segments are insurance operations and other operations 
insurance operations 
our insurance operations segment  formerly known as primary insurance operations  includes the results of our insurance operations 
we currently manage our insurance operations segment through a specialty lines underwriting unit and a personal lines underwriting unit  nearly all of which is subject to the personal lines transaction 
see business specialty lines and business personal lines 
our insurance operations segment also includes run off business which consists of the non specialty commercial lines business being transferred to the hanover effective january   as well as national accounts  certain specialty programs and regional agency business transferred to liberty mutual effective november  see business run off 
other operations 
our other operations segment consists of the activities of onebeacon insurance group  ltd 
and our intermediate subsidiary holding companies which include onebeacon us enterprises holdings  inc and onebeacon us holdings  inc  both us domiciled companies  as well as various intermediate holding companies domiciled in the united states  gibraltar  luxembourg and bermuda 
revenues we account for insurance policies that we write in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises  subsequently codified within asc premiums written are recognized as revenues and are earned ratably over the term of the related policy 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written that are applicable to future insurance coverage provided by policies 
autoone  one of our subsidiaries  which acts as a lad servicing carrier  enters into contractual arrangements with insurance companies to assume private passenger and commercial automobile assigned risk exposures in states and the district of columbia 
autoone receives lad and clad servicing fees from these other companies for assuming these risks 
in addition  autoone chooses to write certain policies voluntarily by taking risks out of the nyaip 
these policies generate takeout credits which can be sold for fees  which we refer to as take out fees  to other carriers 
these other carriers in turn can use such credits to reduce their obligations to write assigned risk business 
autoone s lad and clad servicing and take out fees are recorded as written premium when billed and are earned ratably over the term of the related policy to which the fee relates 
deferred acquisition costs deferred acquisition costs represent commissions  premium taxes  brokerage expenses and other costs that are directly attributable to and vary with the production of new business 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the applicable premium recognition period 
deferred acquisition costs are limited to the amount expected to be recovered from future earned premiums and anticipated investment income 
this limitation is referred to as a premium deficiency 
a premium deficiency is recognized if the sum of expected loss and lae  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums 
a premium deficiency is recognized by charging any unamortized acquisition costs to expense to the extent required in order to eliminate the deficiency 

table of contents loss and loss adjustment expenses loss and lae are charged against income as incurred 
unpaid loss and lae reserves are based on estimates generally determined by claims adjusters  legal counsel and actuarial staff of the ultimate costs of settling claims  including the effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors 
unpaid loss and lae reserves represent management s best estimate of ultimate loss and lae  net of estimated salvage and subrogation recoveries  if applicable 
such estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis and any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in current operations 
the process of estimating loss and lae involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amount of expense to be incurred could be considerably greater than or less than the amounts currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
reinsurance our insurance subsidiaries enter into ceded reinsurance contracts from time to time to protect their businesses from losses due to concentration of risk and to limit losses arising from catastrophic events 
the majority of such reinsurance contracts are executed through excess of loss treaties and catastrophe contracts under which a third party reinsurer indemnifies our insurance subsidiaries for a specified part or all of certain types of losses over stipulated amounts arising from any one occurrence or event 
we also have entered into quota share treaties with reinsurers under which all risks meeting prescribed criteria are ceded to third party reinsurers on a pro rata basis 
the amount of each risk ceded by us is subject to maximum limits that vary by line of business and type of coverage 
amounts related to reinsurance contracts are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts and emerging issues task force topic no 
d eitf topic d  both subsequently codified within asc  as applicable 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policies 
our ability to collect our reinsurance recoverables is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers with whom we have entered into reinsurance contracts 
we are selective in regard to our reinsurers  principally placing reinsurance with those reinsurers with strong financial condition  industry ratings and underwriting ability 
management monitors the financial condition and ratings of our reinsurers on an ongoing basis 
reinsurance premiums  commissions  expense reimbursements and reserves related to reinsured business are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts 
premiums ceded to other companies are reported as a reduction of premiums written 
expense allowances received in connection with reinsurance ceded have been accounted for as a reduction of the related policy acquisition costs 
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock we had two classes of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiaries which were redeemed in the years ended december  and these instruments were classified as liabilities and were carried at their historical carrying values 
all dividends and accretion on our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock have been recorded as interest expense 
see note mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiaries of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents share based compensation compensation philosophy our executive compensation policies are designed with one goal in mind  namely  the maximization of shareholder value over long periods of time 
we believe that this goal is best pursued by utilizing a pay for performance program that serves to attract and retain superior executive talent and provide management with performance based incentives to maximize shareholder value 
through this compensation program  we seek to maximize shareholder value by aligning closely the financial interests of management with those of our shareholders 
the cost of all incentive compensation is fully accrued and expensed 
compensation of our senior management team  including our named executive officers  consists primarily of three components base salary  annual bonus and long term incentive awards 
base salaries have been capped at  annual bonus targets for all senior executives are  with the exception of the chief executive officer at  of base salary 
long term incentives for senior executives have in the past been comprised of performance shares and or performance units 
under these instruments  payouts are explicitly tied to white mountains or onebeacon s performance over a three year period and are highly variable the actual number of shares units paid out at the end of the cycle will range from to of target depending on performance against established goals 
see note employee share based incentive compensation plans of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
additionally  in recognition that the and performance share cycles  as described below  were projected to payout at or close to zero  creating a significant retention risk over the next years the onebeacon compensation committee of the board of directors the compensation committee in february approved cash retention awards for the executive officers and certain members of senior management 
the compensation committee also approved a pool of money for senior management to make retention awards to certain other key personnel 
share based compensation insurance operations through performance cycles for these cycles  onebeacon revised the design of its long term incentive plans from prior plan designs principally to use onebeacon performance units instead of white mountains performance shares  with performance targets primarily tied to onebeacon s adjusted combined ratio 
each unit was initially valued at and compounds in value over the performance period by the underwriting return on capital achieved by onebeacon 
in the case of certain senior officers of our insurance operations segment  a portion of their long term incentive compensation in these periods had been denominated in white mountains performance shares 
as a result of the shift from white mountains performance shares to onebeacon performance units  onebeacon s incentive compensation expense associated with these performance cycles is no longer significantly impacted by changes in the market price of white mountains common shares 
prior to february  the value of onebeacon s performance shares was based upon the market price of an underlying white mountains common share wtm performance shares 
in february  the compensation committee canceled all of onebeacon s wtm performance shares outstanding for the and performance cycles and replaced the awards with two performance share grants  a one year performance cycle and a two year performance cycle  whose value is based upon the market price of an underlying onebeacon common share ob performance shares 
in the performance cycle  a total of  performance shares were earned based upon a performance factor of 
in the performance cycle  a total of  performance shares were earned based upon a performance factor of 

table of contents performance cycle in february  the compensation committee approved the principal performance share goal of the onebeacon long term incentive plan the incentive plan to be growth in its intrinsic business value per share gibvps 
gibvps is defined by the compensation committee with respect to each award cycle 
for the performance cycle  the compensation committee defined gibvps to be a weighted measure comprised of growth in adjusted book value per share  underwriting return on equity and growth in our price per common share 
as of december    performance shares were outstanding with respect to the performance cycle 
performance cycle in february  the compensation committee defined gibvps for the performance cycle to be a weighted measure comprised of growth in adjusted book value per share and underwriting return on equity 
as of december    performance shares were outstanding with respect to the performance cycle 
performance cycle in february  the compensation committee granted performance shares with a goal of growth in book value per share 
as of december    performance shares were outstanding with respect to the performance cycle 
restricted stock units in connection with onebeacon s initial public offering  options were issued to certain key employees as a one time incentive 
the options did not include a mechanism to reflect the contribution to total return from the regular quarterly dividend 
as a result  in february  the compensation committee approved a grant of restricted stock units as a supplement to the initial public offering stock grant 
the performance goal for the restricted stock units is growth in adjusted book value per share 
as of december    restricted stock units were outstanding 
share based compensation recognition our share based compensation plans consist of performance shares which are typically settled in cash  stock options which were granted in connection with our initial public offering and restricted stock units 
we account for these share based compensation plans in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  subsequently codified within asc compensation cost is measured and recognized based on the current market price of the underlying common shares and on the number of shares that are expected to vest 
purchase accounting in connection with purchase accounting for the onebeacon acquisition  we were required to adjust to fair value our loss and lae reserves and the related reinsurance recoverables by million and million  respectively  on our balance sheet as of june  this net change to loss and lae reserves of million is being accreted through an income statement charge ratably with and over the period the claims are settled 
accordingly  we recognized million  million and million of such charges  recorded as loss and lae  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   the outstanding pre tax unaccreted adjustment was 
table of contents income taxes the income tax expense benefit related to pre tax income or loss for the years ended december   and represented effective tax rates of  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was lower than the us statutory rate of primarily due to income generated in jurisdictions other than the united states and the settlement of federal income tax audits for and our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was higher than the us statutory rate of due to a pre tax loss from operations in the united states and income generated in jurisdictions other than the united states  partially offset by non deductible dividends and accretion on the berkshire preferred stock 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was higher than the us statutory rate of primarily due to withholding taxes payable on dividends paid from income generated in the united states and non deductible dividends and accretion on the berkshire preferred stock and zenith preferred stock  partially offset by income generated in jurisdictions other than the united states at lower tax rates 
other acquisitions and dispositions on december   we sold the renewal rights to approximately million in premiums from our non specialty commercial lines business to the hanover 
the transaction includes small commercial accounts and the non specialty portion of the middle market business  beginning with january  effective dates 
as consideration  we received million  and will receive an additional of premiums renewed in excess of million for the first renewal period 
we will continue to manage claims from business written prior to the commercial lines transaction and for business written by the hanover through june  the hanover will reimburse us for our expenses incurred to provide the claims administration services 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold one of our inactive licensed subsidiaries  farmers and merchants insurance company fmic  to pride holdings llc for million in cash and recorded a pre tax gain of million through net other revenues 
during the third quarter of  we acquired ebi  an insurance agency specializing in the entertainment  sports and leisure industries  for million in cash 
in connection with the purchase of ebi  which was accounted for as an acquisition under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with gaap at the time of the acquisition  we recorded the identifiable assets and liabilities of ebi at their fair value at acquisition date 
significant assets and liabilities acquired include premiums and commissions receivable of million and premiums and commissions payable of million 
after allocating the purchase price to identifiable tangible assets and liabilities  we also recorded an adjustment to allocate the remaining acquisition cost to an intangible asset of million which represents the value of business in force at the acquisition date 
the amortization associated with the intangible asset will be amortized over a year period in proportion to the timing of the discounted cash flows used to value the business 
during the year ended december   no amortization was recognized 
during the first quarter of  we sold one of our inactive licensed subsidiaries  midwestern insurance company mwic  to national guaranty insurance company for million in cash and recorded a pre tax gain of million through net other revenues 
during the third quarter of  we sold one of our inactive licensed subsidiaries  american employers insurance company aeic to sparta insurance holdings  inc for million in cash and recorded a pre tax gain of million through net other revenues 
recent developments we have recently entered into two transactions  the commercial lines transaction referenced above and the personal lines transaction discussed below  that will transform us into a specialty lines insurance company 
the transactions will free up significant capital  increase our financial flexibility and also substantially reduce our catastrophe exposure 

table of contents on february   we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our personal lines business to tower 
the transaction includes two insurance companies containing the personal lines business  and two attorneys in fact managing the reciprocals that write the personal lines business in new york and new jersey 
net written premiums for the affected books total approximately million for the year ended december  as consideration  we will receive an amount equal to the statutory surplus in the reciprocals approximately million at december   including the par value of the surplus notes issued by the reciprocals  the gaap equity in the insurance companies and attorneys in fact approximately million at december   plus million 
autoone is not being sold as part of this transaction 
the sale is subject to certain state regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the second quarter of results of operations review of consolidated results a summary of our consolidated financial results for the years ended december   and is as follows year ended december  in millions net written premiums revenues earned premiums net investment income net realized and unrealized investment gains losses net other revenues total revenues expenses loss and lae policy acquisition expenses other underwriting expenses general and administrative expenses accretion of fair value adjustment to loss and lae reserves interest expense on debt interest expense dividends on preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption interest expense accretion on preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption total expenses pre tax income loss income tax expense benefit net income loss including noncontrolling interests less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income loss attributable to onebeacon s shareholders other comprehensive income loss comprehensive net income loss attributable to onebeacon s shareholders

net income attributable to onebeacon s shareholders was million in the year ended december   compared to a net loss attributable to onebeacon s shareholders of million in the year ended december  our total revenues increased to  million in the year ended december   compared to  million in the year ended december  the increase was mainly due to a  million increase in net realized and unrealized investment gains to million 
net realized and unrealized investment losses for the year ended december  reflected the impact of the significant declines and high volatility in the equity markets  the lack of liquidity in the credit markets and the widening of credit spreads experienced during the second half of the increase in earned premiums was due primarily to our specialty lines businesses  partially offset by decreased earned premiums in personal lines and our non specialty commercial lines 
net other revenues increased to million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to pre tax proceeds of million from the renewal rights sale  increased revenues from our non insurance operations and a million gain related to the purchase of a portion of our senior notes  partially offset by a million realized loss related to the settlement of the interest rate swap 
the year ended december  included a million gain from the sale of mwic and a million gain from the sale of fmic 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in net investment income to million in the year ended december   due to a lower average invested asset base and lower investment yields 
contributing to the lower investment yields was a million inflation adjustment related to our inflation indexed treasury securities as compared to an million inflation adjustment related to these securities for the year ended december  our total expenses increased in the year ended december  to  million  compared to  million in the year ended december  loss and lae decreased by to  million in the year ended december  due to lower current accident year catastrophe losses and slightly more favorable loss reserve development 
interest expense decreased by  primarily due to the interest expense related to the berkshire preferred stock which was redeemed in the second quarter of partially offsetting these decreases were increased policy acquisition costs  other underwriting expenses and general and administrative expenses 
policy acquisition expenses increased by to million in the year ended december  mainly due to higher acquisition costs associated with our newer specialty lines businesses and changes in mix of business 
other underwriting expenses increased to million in the year ended december  the year ended december  included lower incentive compensation costs resulting from changes in assumptions on our long term incentive compensation plans 
general and administrative expenses increased to million primarily related to higher operating expenses of our non insurance operations

our gaap combined ratio for the year ended december  decreased to from for the year ended december  the loss and lae ratio decreased points to while the expense ratio increased points to

the year ended december  included million or points of current accident year catastrophe losses  mainly due to losses related to hurricanes ike and gustav  and weather in the southeastern united states experienced in the first quarter 
the year ended december  included million or points of favorable loss reserve development primarily due to lower than expected severity on non catastrophe losses related to professional liability lines and commercial package business and general liability lines partially offset by adverse loss reserve development primarily related to personal injury protection litigation at autoone 
the year ended december  included million or points of favorable loss reserve development primarily due to lower than expected severity on non catastrophe losses and favorable loss reserve development on a prior accident year catastrophe 
the favorable non catastrophe loss reserve development was primarily related to professional liability lines and commercial package business lines partially offset by adverse loss reserve development at autoone and in legacy run off business

net loss attributable to onebeacon s shareholders was million in the year ended december   compared to net income attributable to onebeacon s shareholders of million in the year ended december  as described below  effective january   we adopted the fair value option and elected to record the changes in net unrealized gains and losses from our available for sale securities and our investments in hedge funds and private equity funds in revenues in arriving at net income 
in prior periods  these changes have been included in other comprehensive income 
accordingly  net loss income and pre tax loss income for the year ended december  are not directly comparable to such measures for the year ended december  our total revenues decreased to  million in the year ended december   compared to  million in the year ended december  the decrease was mainly due to a million decrease in net realized investment losses gains to million and the inclusion of a million change in net unrealized investment gains and losses in the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recognized realized losses of million for

our total expenses increased in the year ended december  to  million  compared to  million in the year ended december  loss and lae increased by to  in the year ended december  primarily due to million or points of current accident year catastrophe losses  compared to million or points in the year ended december   partially offset by a million increase in favorable loss reserve development compared to the year ended december  as described below 
policy acquisition expenses increased by to million in the year ended december  mainly due to higher acquisition costs associated with our newer specialty lines businesses and the change in mix of business at obpi 
in addition  in the year ended december   insurance acquisition expenses were lower due to an increase in the deferral rate of policy acquisition costs on commercial lines of business related to the expansion into new states and the benefit of a million state premium tax refund in personal lines 
these increases were slightly offset by a decrease in other underwriting expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million primarily related to operating expenses of ebi which was acquired in the third quarter of during the year ended december   we reallocated reserves of our insurance operations from ongoing lines of business to legacy run off claims  particularly reserves for construction defect and workers compensation related to accident years and prior 
the reallocation shifted million of our reserves from specialty lines million and personal lines million to run off claims net million 
the reallocation included reserves from commercial lines million that are now presented within run off 
this adjustment had no impact on our total combined ratio for the year ended december  the ratio discussions by line of business that follow are based on the ratios as computed prior to the reallocation of reserves 
we believe that a presentation excluding the effect of the reserve reallocation on specialty lines  personal lines and run off loss and lae ratios and gaap combined ratios is meaningful for investors to understand the performance of its underwriting units during our income tax benefit expense related to pre tax income or loss for the years ended december  and represented effective tax rates of and  respectively

the increase in the loss and lae ratio was due to points of current accident year catastrophe losses mainly from hurricanes ike and gustav  and weather in the southeastern united states experienced in the first quarter of the loss and lae ratio was also higher due to large losses in specialty lines at imu and in the non specialty middle market

these increases were partially offset by million or points of favorable loss reserve development due primarily to lower than expected severity on non catastrophe losses as described above 
the year ended december  included million or points of favorable loss reserve development due to lower than expected frequency for professional liability lines and lower than expected severity for personal automobile liability partially offset by adverse loss reserve development for multiple peril lines and workers compensation lines primarily for accident years and prior 
the increase in the expense ratio was from an increase in policy acquisition expenses  offset by a decrease in other underwriting expenses as described above

net written premiums for specialty lines increased by to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million increase in net written premiums compared to the prior year period from ebi which we acquired in the third quarter of  and a million increase in net written premiums from our collector cars and boats business that we began writing in the second quarter of the increase compared to the prior year period was also due to a million increase in net written premiums from obpi  an million increase in net written premiums from a h and a million increase in net written premiums from obgr  partially offset by a million decrease in net written premiums from imu 
the specialty lines combined ratio for the year ended december  decreased to from for the year ended december  the loss and lae ratio decreased points to while the expense ratio increased points to 
the decrease in the loss and lae ratio was mainly due to a point decrease in current accident year non catastrophe and catastrophe losses in the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  which included the impact of large losses at imu  as well as higher catastrophe losses primarily related to hurricanes ike and gustav 
further  the year ended december  included points of favorable loss reserve development primarily related to lower than expected severity in professional liability  compared with points in the year ended december  primarily related to professional liability 
the increase in the expense ratio was mainly due to changes in mix of business within the specialty lines businesses and the mix of products offered within those businesses and the related costs incurred to acquire those businesses 
our collector cars and boats business and some of our other newer specialty lines businesses receive higher compensation than the previous mix of business 
personal lines 
net written premiums for personal lines decreased by to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  in traditional personal lines  net written premiums decreased by to million

excluding the impact of the homeowners quota share  traditional personal lines net written premiums decreased by 
further  net written premiums at autoone decreased by to million primarily due to changes in new york s assigned risk pool and lower writings of voluntary private passenger automobile risks in new york 
with respect to the new york assigned risk pool  market trends indicate that assigned risk volumes are expected to increase to approximately million in  which is up from million in and million in but down from million in market trends indicate that the assigned risk pool in new jersey is expected to increase to approximately million in  which is up from million in and million in  but down from million in the personal lines combined ratio for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december  the loss and lae ratio increased points to  while the expense ratio decreased by points to 
the increase in the loss and lae ratio was primarily due to points of adverse loss reserve development in the year ended december   primarily related to autoone and estimates of new york personal injury protection litigation costs  compared with points of adverse loss reserve development in the year ended december   mainly on personal automobile liability at autoone 
further  the year ended december  included a point increase in the current accident year loss and lae ratio as compared to the prior year period primarily related to higher current accident non catastrophe loss ratios related to poor automobile results 
the decrease in the expense ratio was mainly due to lower policy acquisition expenses as a result of the ceding commission related to the homeowners quota share  as described above 
on february   we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our personal lines business to tower group  inc the transaction includes two insurance companies containing the personal lines business  and two attorneys in fact managing the reciprocals which write the personal lines business in new york and new jersey

run off 
net written premiums for run off decreased by to million in the year ended december   compared with million in the year ended december  net written premiums from non specialty commercial businesses were million in the year ended december   compared with million in the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in the non specialty middle market commercial businesses and a million decrease in the small business division

the decrease in the loss and lae ratio was primarily due to points of favorable loss reserve development in the year ended december   mainly due to lower than expected severity in package business and commercial multi peril  compared with points of favorable loss reserve development related to lower than expected severity in package business and commercial multi peril in the year ended december  further  the year 
table of contents ended december  included points of current accident year catastrophe losses primarily related to severe wind and thunderstorm events  compared with points of current accident year catastrophe losses in the year ended december  primarily related to hurricane ike in our non specialty middle market commercial businesses and small business division and losses from tornados in the southeastern united states in our non specialty middle market commercial businesses in the first quarter 
these favorable variances were partially offset by a point increase in non catastrophe losses in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year period 
the increase in the expense ratio was primarily due to a point increase in other underwriting expenses which included points of higher incentive compensation costs  severance and other costs associated with the renewal rights transaction  partially offset by a point decrease in policy acquisition costs 
results from run off include underwriting losses from legacy run off operations  including national accounts  certain specialty programs and regional agency business transferred to liberty mutual 
legacy run off business generated an underwriting loss of million in the year ended december   compared to an underwriting loss of million in the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower incurred loss and lae in the year ended december  which included million of loss and lae  compared with million of loss and lae in the year ended december  due in part to million of incurred unallocated loss adjustment expenses ulae related to the liberty mutual settlement 
insurance operations year ended december  versus year ended december  overview 
our gaap combined ratio increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase in our combined ratio was primarily due to higher catastrophe losses 
during the year ended december   we reallocated reserves of our insurance operations from ongoing lines of business to legacy run off claims  particularly reserves for construction defect and workers compensation related to accident years and prior 
the reallocation shifted million of our reserves from specialty lines million and personal lines million to run off claims net million 
the reallocation included reserves from commercial lines million that are now presented within run off 
this adjustment had no impact on our total combined ratio for the year ended december  the ratio discussions by line of business that follow are based on the ratios as computed prior to the reallocation of reserves 
we believe that a presentation excluding the effect of the reserve reallocation on specialty lines  personal lines and run off loss and lae ratios and gaap combined ratios is meaningful for investors to understand the performance of its underwriting units during specialty lines 
net written premiums for specialty lines increased by to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to million in net written premiums from our collector cars and boats business that we began writing in the second quarter of the increase compared to prior year was also due to writings from ebi which we acquired in the third quarter of  as well as growth in a h and obgr 
in addition  net written premiums at obpi increased million 
the specialty lines combined ratio for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december  the loss and lae ratio decreased point to while the expense ratio increased points to 
the decrease in the loss and lae ratio was mainly due to points of favorable loss reserve development in the year ended december  primarily related to lower than expected severity in professional liability  compared with points in the year ended december  primarily related to professional liability 
partially offsetting this decrease was a point increase in current accident year non catastrophe losses in the year ended december  mainly due to large losses at imu  compared with the year ended december

personal lines 
net written premiums for personal lines decreased by to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  in traditional personal lines  net written premiums decreased by to million due to the decision to cease writing business in houston general insurance exchange houston general in late  lower new business associated with coastal restrictions implemented at adirondack insurance and higher reinsurance costs at adirondack insurance  lower premium volume from the involuntary market in massachusetts  and the discontinuation of surplus lines business 
in january  houston general entered into a reinsurance agreement with universal holdings of north america universal under which houston general ceded million of unearned premiums to universal

the decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to decreased other underwriting expenses as a result of the decision to cease writing business in houston general and actions taken in to better align personal lines staffing with our business needs

during the third and fourth quarters of  there were significant declines and high volatility in the equity markets  a lack of liquidity in the credit markets and a widening of credit spreads on debt securities 
these factors had a significant adverse effect on the performance of our investment portfolio in in the second half of  we shifted our investment philosophy from a total return focus to a capital preservation focus in response to the significant declines and high volatility in equity markets  the lack of liquidity in the credit markets and the widening of credit spreads on fixed income securities experienced

table of contents asset backed securities in the past several years  many originators of residential mortgage and home equity loans relaxed their underwriting standards and issued loans to customers with weak credit profiles 
this practice is often referred to as sub prime mortgage lending 
the slowing us housing market has caused many sub prime mortgage customers to be unable to refinance their mortgage loans  particularly those customers who had adjustable rate mortgages that reset at a higher rate than the rate at the origination of their mortgage 
as a result  there have been significantly higher delinquency and foreclosure rates in the united states 
we purchase commercial and residential mortgage backed securities to maximize our fixed income portfolio s risk adjusted returns and diversify the portfolio risk from primarily corporate credit risk to a mix of credit and cash flow risk 
our non agency commercial mortgage backed portfolio is generally of short tenor and structurally senior  with more than points of credit enhancement on average 
we are not an originator of residential mortgage loans and held million of residential mortgage backed securities categorized as sub prime as of december  in addition  our investments in hedge funds and private equity funds contain negligible amounts of sub prime mortgage backed securities as of december  we consider sub prime mortgage backed securities to be those that are issued from dedicated sub prime shelves  dedicated second lien shelves ie  we consider investments backed primarily by second liens to be a sub prime risk regardless of credit score or other metrics or otherwise have underlying loan pools that exhibit weak credit characteristics 
there are also mortgage backed securities that we categorize as non prime also called alt a or a that are backed by collateral that has overall credit quality between prime and sub prime  as determined based on a review of the characteristics of their underlying mortgage loan pools  such as credit scores and financial ratios 
as of december   we did not hold any mortgage backed securities classified as non prime 
we did not own any collateralized debt obligations  including residential mortgage backed collateralized debt obligations 
our investments in asset backed securities are generally valued using matrix and other pricing models 
key inputs in a typical valuation are benchmark yields  benchmark securities  reported trades  issuer spreads  bids  offers  credit ratings and prepayment speeds 
at december   the market for our investments in asset backed securities remained active and  accordingly  we did not adjust the fair value estimates for the effect of illiquidity

securities lending we participated in a securities lending program as a mechanism for generating additional investment income on our fixed maturity and common equity portfolios 
under the securities lending arrangements  certain of our fixed maturity and common equity investments were loaned to other institutions for short periods of time through a lending agent 
we maintained control over the securities we loaned  retained the earnings and cash flows associated with the loaned securities and received a fee from the borrower for the temporary use of the asset 
collateral  in the form of cash and united states government securities  was required at a rate of of the fair value of the loaned securities 
an indemnification agreement with the lending agent protected us in the event a borrower became insolvent or failed to return any of the securities on loan 
in the event of a shortfall in the collateral amount required to be returned to the securities lending counterparty eg  as a result of investment losses  we were obligated to make up any deficiency 
prior to february  the collateral was controlled by the lending agent 
the lending agent managed the investment of the cash collateral  however  other than in the event of default by the borrower  this collateral was not available to us and was remitted to the borrower by the lending agent upon the return of the loaned securities 
because of these restrictions  we considered our securities 
table of contents lending activities to be non cash transactions 
the fair value of the securities lending collateral was recorded as both an asset and liability on the balance sheet 
in february  we amended the terms of the securities lending program to give us more control over the investment of borrowers collateral and to separate the assets supporting that collateral into a segregated account 
pursuant to the amendment  i the guidelines for the investment of any new cash collateral as well as the reinvestment of cash were narrowed to permit investment in only cash equivalent securities  ii we have the authority to direct the lending agent to both sell specific collateral securities in the segregated account and to not sell certain collateral securities which the lending agent proposes to sell  and iii we and the lending agent agreed to manage the securities lending program toward an orderly wind down 
in may  we instructed the lending agent not to make any additional loans of securities and to recall all of the securities on loan and fund the return of collateral to the borrower 
as of december   million in collateral had not been returned to the borrower 
as a result of the actions described above  the securities lending assets are no longer segregated and are included within our investment securities 
at december   prior to the amendment of the terms of the securities lending program  the total market value of our securities on loan was million with corresponding collateral of million  resulting in an unrealized loss of million recorded in change in net unrealized investment gains and losses  a component of net realized and unrealized investment gains losses 
in prior to exiting the securities lending program  we recorded million of net realized and unrealized gains 
subsequent to exiting the program  we recorded million of net realized and unrealized gains on the securities returned to us  resulting in a total of million of net realized and unrealized losses in connection with our exiting from the program 
the securities lending program has generated million of additional investment income for us since inception in non gaap financial measures this report includes three non gaap financial measures that have been reconciled to their most comparable gaap financial measures 
onebeacon believes these measures to be useful supplements to the comparable gaap measures in evaluating onebeacon s financial performance 
in addition  certain of these non gaap financial measures have been adjusted to exclude the impact of economically defeasing the company s mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
in connection with its initial public offering  the company created two irrevocable grantor trusts and funded them with assets sufficient to make the remaining dividend and redemption payments for million of preferred stock that was redeemed in june and million of preferred stock that was redeemed in may the company created and funded these trusts to appropriately capitalize and leverage the company in preparation for and in connection with its initial public offering 
having completed these actions  onebeacon believes that presentation of certain of the non gaap financial measures as described below  adjusted to exclude the impact of the economic defeasance of the preferred stock as of and for the respective periods  is a useful supplement to understanding the company s earnings and profitability 
adjusted book value per share is a non gaap financial measure which is derived by excluding the impact of economically defeasing the company s mandatorily redeemable preferred stock from book value per share  the most closely comparable gaap measure 
for the reason stated above  onebeacon believes that adjusted book value per share is a useful supplement to understanding the company s earnings and profitability 
the reconciliation of book value per share to adjusted book value per share is included on page adjusted onebeacon s shareholders equity  which is used in calculating adjusted book value per share a non gaap financial measure described above  is derived by excluding the impact of economically defeasing the company s mandatorily redeemable preferred stock from onebeacon s 
table of contents shareholders equity  the most closely comparable gaap measure 
the reconciliation of onebeacon s shareholders equity to adjusted onebeacon s shareholders equity is included on page loss and loss adjustment expense ratio prior to reserve reallocation and total combined ratio prior to reserve reallocation are non gaap financial measures which are derived by excluding the impact of the reallocation of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves from the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and the gaap combined ratio 
during  onebeacon reallocated loss and loss adjustment expense reserves from ongoing lines of business to run off which reduced the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios and the gaap combined ratios for onebeacon s specialty  commercial and personal lines of business but had no impact on the ratios for onebeacon s total insurance operations 
onebeacon believes that a presentation excluding the effect of the reserve reallocation on the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios and combined ratios for specialty  commercial and personal lines is a meaningful supplement for investors to understand the performance of its underwriting units 
the reconciliation of these non gaap financial measures to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and gaap combined ratio  the most closely comparable gaap measures  is included on page liquidity and capital resources operating cash and short term investments our sources and uses of cash are as follows holding company level 
the primary sources of cash for onebeacon insurance group  ltd 
and certain of our intermediate holding companies are expected to be dividends and tax sharing payments received from our insurance operating subsidiaries  capital raising activities and net investment income and proceeds from sales and maturities of holding company investments 
the primary uses of cash are expected to be share repurchases  interest payments on our debt obligations  repurchases of debt  dividend payments on our common shares  purchases of investments  payments made to tax authorities  contributions to subsidiaries and holding company operating expenses 
operating subsidiary level 
the primary sources of cash for our operating subsidiaries are expected to be premium collections  net investment income  capital raising activities and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
the primary uses of cash are expected to be claim payments  policy acquisition costs  debt obligations  operating expenses  the purchase of investments and dividends and tax sharing payments made to parent holding companies 
insurance companies typically collect premiums on policies that they write prior to paying claims made under those policies 
during periods of premium growth  insurance companies typically experience positive cash flow from operations  as premium receipts typically exceed claim payments 
when this happens  positive cash flow from operations is usually offset by negative cash flow from investing activities  as the positive operating cash flow is used to purchase investments 
conversely  during periods of premium decline  insurance companies typically experience negative cash flow from operations  even during periods in which they report gaap net income  as the claims that they pay exceed the premiums that they collect 
when this happens  negative cash flow from operations is typically offset by positive cash flow from investing activities  as invested assets are sold to fund current claim payments 
both internal and external forces influence our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
claim settlements  premium levels and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions 
in many cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the liability for that loss 
the exact timing of the payment of claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty 
our operating subsidiaries maintain portfolios of invested 
table of contents assets with varying maturities and a substantial amount of short term investments to provide adequate liquidity for the payment of claims 
management believes that our cash balances  cash flows from operations and cash flows from investments are adequate to meet expected cash requirements for the foreseeable future on both a holding company and operating subsidiary level 
dividend capacity under the insurance laws of the states and jurisdictions under which our operating subsidiaries are domiciled  an insurer is restricted with respect to the timing or the amount of dividends it may pay without prior approval by regulatory authorities 
accordingly  there can be no assurance regarding the amount of such dividends that may be paid by such subsidiaries in the future 
generally  our regulated insurance operating subsidiaries have the ability to pay dividends during any month period in an amount equal to the greater of prior year statutory net income or of prior year end statutory surplus  subject to the availability of unassigned funds 
based on statutory surplus of billion  our top tier regulated insurance operating subsidiaries have the ability to pay approximately million of dividends during  subject to the availability of unassigned funds 
as of december   onebeacon s top tier regulated insurance operating subsidiaries had billion of unassigned funds 
as of december   we had approximately million of unrestricted net cash and fixed maturity investments outside of our regulated insurance operating subsidiaries 
during the years ended december   and  our regulated operating subsidiaries paid million  million and million  respectively  of dividends to onebeacon llc

during the year ended december   we also paid million of a special dividend to holders of onebeacon s common shares 
obh s ability to declare or pay dividends was limited by the terms of the series a preferred stock issued to berkshire 
obh could not  in certain circumstances  declare or pay any dividend or distribution to any other class or series of stock without the consent of the holders of a majority of outstanding shares of the berkshire preferred stock 
under the terms of a keep well agreement dated november  between white mountains and obh the keep well  white mountains had agreed to return to obh up to approximately billion if some or all of that amount was required by obh to meet its obligations under the terms of the berkshire preferred stock 
as described below  the keep well has expired 
under the keep well  white mountains had to make any required contributions to obh prior to making any distributions to its shareholders 
the aggregate amount of distributions that white mountains could make to its shareholders was limited  the limit increased or decreased by an amount equal to white mountains consolidated net income or loss over the remaining life of the keep well 
the keep well expired when all obligations of the berkshire preferred stock were satisfied upon its redemption in may see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations economic defeasance for a discussion of the creation and funding of an irrevocable grantor trust to economically defease the berkshire preferred stock 
economic defeasance in connection with our initial public offering  two of our subsidiaries  obh and obeh  each established an irrevocable grantor trust 
the assets of each trust were solely dedicated to the 
table of contents satisfaction of the payment of dividends and redemption amounts on  respectively  the million liquidation preference of obh s berkshire preferred stock and million liquidation preference of obeh s zenith preferred stock 
obh and obeh funded their respective trusts with cash and purchased a portfolio of fixed maturity securities issued by the us government and government sponsored enterprises 
the scheduled interest and principal payments were sufficient to pay when due all amounts required under the terms of the berkshire preferred stock and the zenith preferred stock 
the creation and funding of the trusts did not legally defease the preferred stock nor create any additional rights for the holders of the preferred stock either in the trusts or otherwise  although the assets in the trusts were segregated from obh s and obeh s other general assets and were not available to obh or obeh for any use other than the payment of the berkshire preferred stock and the zenith preferred stock 
assets held in one of the trusts were used to redeem the zenith preferred stock in june  while assets held in the other trust were used to redeem the berkshire preferred stock in may white mountains capital  inc  a subsidiary of white mountains  served as the trustee for the irrevocable grantor trusts 
pre tax net investment income earned on these investments totaled million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and insurance float insurance float is an important aspect of our insurance operations 
insurance float represents funds that an insurance company holds for a limited time 
in an insurance operation  float arises because premiums are collected before losses are paid 
this interval can extend over many years 
during that time  the insurer invests the funds 
when the premiums that an insurer collects do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay  the result is an underwriting loss  which is considered to be the cost of insurance float 
the amount and cost of insurance float for us is affected by underlying market conditions  as well as acquisitions or dispositions of insurance business 
although insurance float can be calculated using numbers determined under gaap  insurance float is not a gaap concept and  therefore  there is no comparable gaap measure 
we calculate our insurance float by taking our net invested assets and subtracting our total capital

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the consolidated financial statements presented herein include all adjustments considered necessary by management to fairly present our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the historical consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to fair value measurements of investments  loss and lae reserves  reinsurance transactions and purchase accounting 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

table of contents management believes that certain of these estimates are considered critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability 
the descriptions below summarize the more significant estimates used in the preparation of our historical consolidated financial statements 
fair value considerations on january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  subsequently codified as asc asc provides a revised definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands financial statement disclosure requirements for fair value information 
under asc  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants an exit price 
asc establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between inputs based on market data from independent sources observable inputs and a reporting entity s internal assumptions based upon the best information available when external market data is limited or unavailable unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy in asc prioritizes fair value measurements into three levels based on the nature of the inputs 
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities have the highest priority level  followed by observable inputs other than quoted prices  including prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities level and unobservable inputs  including the reporting entity s estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use  having the lowest priority level 
effective january   we adopted asc for our available for sale securities and our investments in hedge funds and private equity funds 
consistent with the guidance in asc  in conjunction with the adoption  these securities are now reported as trading securities 
upon adoption  we recorded an adjustment of million to reclassify net unrealized gains  after tax  and net unrealized foreign currency translation gains  after tax  related to investments from accumulated other comprehensive income to opening retained earnings 
subsequent to adoption  we report changes in fair value in revenues before the effect of tax 
we use brokers and outside pricing services to assist in determining fair values 
for investments in active markets  we use the quoted market prices provided by the outside pricing services to determine fair value 
the outside pricing services we use have indicated that they will only provide prices where observable inputs are available 
in circumstances where quoted market prices are unavailable  we utilize fair value estimates based upon other observable inputs including matrix pricing  benchmark interest rates  market comparables and other relevant inputs 
in circumstances where observable inputs are adjusted to reflect management s best estimate of fair value  such fair value measurements are considered a lower level measurement in the fair value hierarchy 
our process to validate the market prices obtained from the outside pricing sources includes  but is not limited to  periodic evaluation of model pricing methodologies and analytical reviews of certain prices 
we also periodically perform back testing of selected sales activity to determine whether there are any significant differences between the market price used to value the security prior to sale and the actual sale price 
other investments  which are comprised of hedge funds and private equity funds for which the fair value option has been elected  are carried at fair value based upon our proportionate interest in the underlying fund s net asset value  which is deemed to approximate fair value 
the fair value of our investments in hedge funds and private equity funds has been estimated using net asset value because it reflects the fair value of the funds underlying investments in accordance with asc we employ a number of procedures to assess the reasonableness of the fair value measurements  including obtaining and reviewing each fund s audited financial statements and discussing each fund s pricing with the fund s manager 
however  since the fund managers do not provide sufficient information to independently evaluate the pricing inputs and methods for each underlying investment  the inputs are 
table of contents considered to be unobservable 
accordingly  the fair values of our investment in hedge funds and private equity funds have been classified as level under the fair value hierarchy 
in circumstances where the underlying investments are publicly traded  such as the investments made by hedge funds  the fair value of the underlying investments is determined using current market prices 
in circumstances where the underlying investments are not publicly traded  such as the investments made by private equity funds  the private equity fund managers have considered the need for a liquidity discount on each of the underlying investments when determining the fund s net asset value in accordance with asc in circumstances where our portion of a fund s net asset value is deemed to differ from fair value due to illiquidity or other factors associated with our investment in the fund  including counterparty credit risk  the net asset value is adjusted accordingly 
at december  and december   we did not record an adjustment to the net asset value related to our investments in hedge funds or private equity funds 
as of december  and  other investments represented approximately and  respectively  of the investment portfolio recorded at fair value 
other investments accounted for at fair value as of december  and were comprised of million and million  respectively  in hedge funds  million and million  respectively  in private equity funds and million for both periods of an investment in a community reinvestment vehicle 
at december  and  we held investments in and hedge funds  respectively  and and private equity funds  respectively 
the largest investment in a single fund was million and million at december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the investment portfolio recorded at fair value was priced based upon observable inputs 
the fair value measurements at december  and for assets for which we adopted asc and any related level inputs are as follows fair value at december  level inputs level percentage in millions fixed maturity investments us government and agency obligations debt securities issued by industrial corporations municipal obligations asset backed securities foreign government obligations preferred stocks fixed maturity investments short term investments common equity securities convertible bonds other investments total

we used quoted market prices for similar securities that were adjusted to reflect management s best estimate of fair value  this security is classified as a level measurement 
in addition to the investment portfolio described above  we had million and million  respectively  of liabilities recorded at fair value and included in other liabilities as of december  and these liabilities relate to securities that have been sold short by a limited partnership that we invest in and are required to consolidate in accordance with gaap 
all of the liabilities included in the million and million  respectively  have been deemed to have a level designation as of december  and as of december   other liabilities also included million related to the fair value of the interest rate swap on the mortgage note 
the interest rate swap was deemed to have a level designation at december  during the second quarter of  we repaid the outstanding balance on the mortgage note and settled the interest rate swap

the changes in level fair value measurements for the year ended december  are as follows fixed maturity investments common equity securities convertible bonds other investments total in millions balance at january  total net realized and unrealized gains losses purchases sales transfers in transfers out balance at december  transfers in for the year ended december  comprise securities for which observable inputs became unavailable as well as securities for which quoted market prices were deemed to be unreliable 
observable inputs in the form of quoted market prices for similar securities became unavailable for securities with a fair value of million 
quoted market prices for these securities 
table of contents had been used at december  to estimate fair value  and as such  these securities were categorized as a level measurement at december  in addition  the estimated fair values for securities of million for which the quoted prices provided by a third party source were deemed unreliable and could not be validated against an alternative source are reflected in transfers in 
the fair values of these securities were estimated using industry standard pricing models  in which management selected inputs using its best judgment 
these inputs principally included benchmark yields  benchmark securities  reported trades  issuer spreads  bids  offers  credit ratings and prepayment speeds 
we use pricing models which use the same valuation methodology for all level measurements for fixed maturities 
these securities are considered to be level because the measurements are not directly observable 
at december   the estimated fair values for these securities determined using the industry standard pricing models were million less than the estimated fair values based upon quoted prices provided by a third party 
transfers out of million for the year ended december  comprise securities which had been previously classified as level measurements and were recategorized as level measurements when quoted market prices for similar securities that were considered reliable and could be validated against an alternative source became available during the year ended december  loss and lae reserves other than asbestos and environmental reserves and construction defect claim reserves we establish loss and lae reserves that are estimates of amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses in the future for insured events that have already occurred 
the process of estimating reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and  as of any given date  is inherently uncertain 
loss and lae reserves are typically comprised of case reserves for claims reported and reserves for losses that have occurred but for which claims have not yet been reported  referred to as ibnr reserves  which include a provision for expected future development on case reserves 
case reserves are estimated based on the experience and knowledge of claims staff regarding the nature and potential cost of each claim and are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
ibnr reserves are derived by subtracting paid loss and lae and case reserves from estimates of ultimate loss and lae 
actuaries estimate ultimate loss and lae using various generally accepted actuarial methods applied to known losses and other relevant information 
like case reserves  ibnr reserves are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
ultimate loss and lae are generally determined by extrapolation of claim emergence and settlement patterns observed in the past that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future 
in forecasting ultimate loss and lae with respect to any line of business  past experience with respect to that line of business is the primary resource  but cannot be relied upon in isolation 
our own experience  particularly claims development experience  such as trends in case reserves  payments on and closings of claims  as well as changes in business mix and coverage limits  is the most important information for estimating our reserves 
external data  available from organizations such as statistical bureaus  consulting firms and reinsurance companies  is sometimes used to supplement or corroborate our own experience  and can be especially useful for estimating costs of new business 
for some lines of business  such as long tail coverages discussed below  claims data reported in the most recent accident year is often too limited to provide a meaningful basis for analysis due to the typical delay in reporting of claims 
for this type of business  we use a selected loss ratio method for the initial accident year or years 
this is a standard and accepted actuarial reserve estimation method in these circumstances in which the loss ratio is selected based upon information used in pricing policies for that line of business  as well as any publicly available industry data  such as industry pricing  experience and trends  for that line of business 

table of contents uncertainties in estimating ultimate loss and lae are magnified by the time lag between when a claim actually occurs and when it is reported and settled 
this time lag is sometimes referred to as the claim tail 
the claim tail for most property coverages is typically short usually a few days up to a few months 
the claim tail for liability casualty coverages  such as automobile liability  general liability  products liability  multiple peril coverage  and workers compensation  can be especially long as claims are often reported and ultimately paid or settled years  even decades  after the related loss events occur 
during the long claims reporting and settlement period  additional facts regarding coverages written in prior accident years  as well as about actual claims and trends may become known and  as a result  we may adjust our reserves 
if management determines that an adjustment is appropriate  the adjustment is booked in the accounting period in which such determination is made in accordance with gaap 
accordingly  should reserves need to be increased or decreased in the future from amounts currently established  future results of operations would be negatively or positively impacted  respectively 
in determining ultimate loss and lae  the cost to indemnify claimants  provide needed legal defense and other services for insureds and administer the investigation and adjustment of claims are considered 
these claim costs are influenced by many factors that change over time  such as expanded coverage definitions as a result of new court decisions  inflation in costs to repair or replace damaged property  inflation in the cost of medical services and legislated changes in statutory benefits  as well as by the particular  unique facts that pertain to each claim 
as a result  the rate at which claims arose in the past and the costs to settle them may not always be representative of what will occur in the future 
the factors influencing changes in claim costs are often difficult to isolate or quantify and developments in paid and incurred losses from historical trends are frequently subject to multiple and conflicting interpretations 
changes in coverage terms or claims handling practices may also cause future experience and or development patterns to vary from the past 
a key objective of actuaries in developing estimates of ultimate loss and lae  and resulting ibnr reserves  is to identify aberrations and systemic changes occurring within historical experience and accurately adjust for them so that the future can be projected reliably 
because of the factors previously discussed  this process requires the use of informed judgment and is inherently uncertain 
our actuaries use several generally accepted actuarial methods to evaluate our loss and lae reserves  each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses 
we place more or less reliance on a particular method based on the facts and circumstances at the time the reserve estimates are made 
these methods generally fall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories historical paid loss development methods these methods use historical loss payments over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses 
historical paid loss development methods assume that the ratio of losses paid in one period to losses paid in an earlier period will remain constant 
these methods necessarily assume that factors that have affected paid losses in the past  such as inflation or the effects of litigation  will remain constant in the future 
because historical paid loss development methods do not use case reserves to estimate ultimate losses  they can be more reliable than the other methods discussed below that look to case reserves such as actuarial methods that use incurred losses in situations where there are significant changes in how case reserves are established by a company s claims adjusters 
however  historical paid loss development methods are more leveraged  meaning that small changes in payments have a larger impact on estimates of ultimate losses  than actuarial methods that use incurred losses because cumulative loss payments take much longer to equal the expected ultimate losses than cumulative incurred amounts 
in addition  and for similar reasons  historical paid loss development methods are often slow to react to situations when new or different factors arise than those that have affected paid losses in the past 

table of contents historical incurred loss development methods these methods  like historical paid loss development methods  assume that the ratio of losses in one period to losses in an earlier period will remain constant in the future 
however  instead of using paid losses  these methods use incurred losses ie  the sum of cumulative historical loss payments plus outstanding case reserves over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses 
historical incurred loss development methods can be preferable to historical paid loss development methods because they explicitly take into account open cases and the claims adjusters evaluations of the cost to settle all known claims 
however  historical incurred loss development methods necessarily assume that case reserving practices are consistently applied over time 
therefore  when there have been significant changes in how case reserves are established  using incurred loss data to project ultimate losses can be less reliable than other methods 
expected loss ratio methods these methods are based on the assumption that ultimate losses vary proportionately with premiums 
expected loss ratios are typically developed based upon the information used in pricing  and are multiplied by the total amount of premiums written to calculate ultimate losses 
expected loss ratio methods are useful for estimating ultimate losses in the early years of long tailed lines of business  when little or no paid or incurred loss information is available 
adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods these methods take traditional historical paid and incurred loss development methods and adjust them for the estimated impact of changes from the past in factors such as inflation  the speed of claim payments or the adequacy of case reserves 
adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods are often more reliable methods of predicting ultimate losses in periods of significant change  provided the actuaries can develop methods to reasonably quantify the impact of changes 
we perform an actuarial review of our recorded reserves each quarter 
our actuaries compare the previous quarter s estimates of paid loss and lae  case reserves and ibnr to amounts indicated by actual experience 
differences between previous estimates and actual experience are evaluated to determine whether a given actuarial method for estimating loss and lae should be relied upon to a greater or lesser extent than it had been in the past 
while some variance is expected each quarter due to the inherent uncertainty in loss and lae  persistent or large variances would indicate that prior assumptions and or reliance on certain reserving methods may need to be revised going forward 
in its selection of recorded reserves  our management historically gave greater weight to adjusted paid loss development methods  which are not dependent on the consistency of case reserving practices  over methods that rely on incurred losses 
in recent years  the amount of weight given to methods based on incurred losses has increased with management s confidence that our case reserving practices have been more consistently applied 
upon completion of each quarterly review  our actuaries select indicated reserve levels based on the results of the actuarial methods described previously  which are the primary consideration in determining management s best estimate of required reserves 
however  in making its best estimate  management also considers other qualitative factors that may lead to a difference between held reserves and actuarially recommended levels in the future 
typically  these factors exist when management and our actuaries conclude that there is insufficient historical incurred and paid loss information or that trends included in the historical incurred and paid loss information are unlikely to repeat in the future 
such factors include  among others  recent entry into new markets or new products  improvements in the claims department that are expected to lessen future ultimate loss costs and legal and regulatory developments 
at december  and  total carried reserves were and above the actuarial point estimate  respectively 

table of contents construction defect claims reserves construction defect claims are a non a e exposure that has proven to have a greater degree of uncertainty when estimating loss and lae using generally accepted actuarial methods 
our general liability and multiple peril lines of business have been significantly impacted by a large number of construction defect claims 
construction defect is a liability allegation relating to defective work performed in the construction of structures such as apartments  condominiums  single family dwellings or other housing  as well as the sale of defective building materials 
such claims seek recovery due to damage caused by alleged deficient construction techniques or workmanship 
much of the recent claims activity has been generated by plaintiffs lawyers who approach new homeowners  and in many cases homeowner associations with large numbers of homeowners in multi residential complexes  about defects or other flaws in their homes 
claims for construction defects began with claims relating to exposures in california 
then  as plaintiffs lawyers organized suits in other states with high levels of multi residential construction  construction defect claims were reported in nearby western states  such as colorado and nevada  and eventually throughout the country 
the reporting of such claims can be quite delayed as the statute of limitations can be up to ten years 
court decisions have expanded insurers exposure to construction defect claims as well 
for example  in california courts adopted a continuous trigger theory in which all companies that had ever insured a property that was alleged to have been damaged must respond to the claimant  even if evidence of the alleged damage did not appear until after the insurance period had expired 
as a result  construction defect claims may be reported more than ten years after a project has been completed as litigation can proceed for several years before an insurance company is identified as a potential contributor 
claims have also emerged from parties claiming additional insured status on policies issued to other parties eg  such as contractors seeking coverage on a sub contractor s policy 
further  in reserving for these claims  there is additional uncertainty due to the potential for further unfavorable judicial rulings and regulatory actions 
the primary actuarial methods that are used to estimate loss and lae reserves for construction defect claims are frequency and severity methods 
these methods separately project the frequency of future reported claims and the average cost or severity of individual claims 
the reserve is the product of the projected number of reported claims and the severity 
a large number of construction defect claims have been identified relating to coverages that we had written in the past through commercial union corporation and general accident corporation of america  which we refer to as our legacy companies  and their subsidiaries in california  colorado  nevada  washington and oregon 
management has sought to mitigate future construction defect risks in all states by no longer providing insurance to certain residential general contractors and sub contractors involved in multi habitational projects 
mitigating actions also included initiating the withdrawal from problematic sub segments within our construction book of business  such as street and road construction  water  sewer and pipeline construction 
as a result of these actions  management believes that the number of reported construction defect claims relating to coverages written in the past peaked in and will continue to decline 
asbestos and environmental reserves our reserves include provisions made for claims that assert damages from asbestos and environmental  or a e  related exposures 
asbestos claims relate primarily to injuries asserted by those who allegedly came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up cost obligations  particularly as mandated by federal and state environmental protection agencies 
in addition to the factors described above under non asbestos and environmental reserves regarding the reserving process  we estimate our a e reserves based upon  among other factors  facts surrounding reported cases and exposures to claims  such as policy limits and deductibles  current law  past and projected claim activity and past settlement values for similar claims  as well as analysis of industry studies and events  such as recent settlements 
table of contents and asbestos related bankruptcies 
the cost of administering a e claims  which is an important factor in estimating loss and lae reserves  tends to be higher than in the case of non a e claims due to the higher legal costs typically associated with a e claims 
a large portion of our a e losses resulted from the operations of the employers group  an entity acquired by one of the legacy companies in these operations  including business of employers surplus lines insurance company and employers liability assurance corporation  provided primary and excess liability insurance for commercial insureds  including fortune sized accounts  some of whom subsequently experienced claims for a e losses 
we stopped writing such coverage in our liabilities for a e losses from business underwritten in the recent past are substantially limited by the application of exclusionary clauses in the policy language that eliminated coverage for such claims 
after for pollution and for asbestos  most liability policies contained industry standard absolute exclusions of such claims 
in earlier years  various exclusions were also applied  but the wording of those exclusions was less strict and subsequent court rulings have reduced their effectiveness 
we also incurred a e losses via our participation in industry pools and associations 
the most significant of these pools was excess casualty reinsurance association  or ecra  which provided excess liability reinsurance to us insurers from until the early s 
ecra incurred significant liabilities for a e  of which we bear approximately a share at both december  and  or million and million at december  and  respectively  which is fully reflected in our loss and lae reserves 
more recently  since the s  we have experienced an influx of claims from commercial insureds  including many non fortune sized accounts written during the s and s  who are named as defendants in asbestos lawsuits 
as a number of large well known manufacturers of asbestos and asbestos containing products have gone into bankruptcy  plaintiffs have sought recoveries from peripheral defendants  such as installers  transporters or sellers of such products  or from owners of premises on which the plaintiffs exposure to asbestos allegedly occurred 
at december   policyholders had asbestos related claims against us 
in  new insureds with such peripheral involvement presented asbestos claims under prior policies we had written 
historically  most asbestos claims have been asserted as product liability claims 
recently  insureds who have exhausted the available products liability limits of their insurance policies have sought from insurers such as us payment for asbestos claims under the premises and operations coverage of their liability policies  which may not be subject to similar aggregate limits 
we expect this trend to continue 
however  to date there have been fewer of these premises and operations coverage claims than product liability coverage claims 
this may be due to a variety of factors  including that it may be more difficult for underlying plaintiffs to establish losses as stemming from premises and operations exposures  which requires proof of the defendant s negligence  rather than products liability under which strict legal liability applies 
premises and operations claims may vary significantly and policyholders may seek large amounts  although such claims frequently settle for a fraction of the initial alleged amount 
accordingly  there is a great deal of variation in damages awarded for the actual injuries 
as of december   there were approximately active claims by insureds against us without product liability coverage asserting operations or premises coverage  which may not be subject to aggregate limits under the policies 
immediately preceding the onebeacon acquisition  we purchased a reinsurance contract with nico under which we are entitled to recover from nico up to billion in the future for asbestos claims arising from business written by us in and prior  environmental claims arising from business written by us in and prior  and certain other exposures 
under the terms of the nico cover  nico receives the economic benefit of reinsurance recoverables from certain of our third party reinsurers in existence at the time the nico cover was executed  or third party recoverables 
as a 
table of contents result  the third party recoverables serve to protect the billion limit of nico coverage for the benefit of us 
any amounts uncollectible from third party reinsurers due to dispute or the reinsurers financial inability to pay are covered by nico under its agreement with us 
third party recoverables are typically for the amount of loss in excess of a stated level each year 
of claim payments from through  approximately of a e losses have been recovered under the historical third party reinsurance 
in september  we completed a study of our a e exposures 
this study considered  among other items  facts  such as policy limits  deductibles and available third party reinsurance  related to reported claims  current law  past and projected claim activity and past settlement values for similar claims  industry studies and events  such as recent settlements and asbestos related bankruptcies  and collectibility of third party reinsurance 
based on the study  we increased our best estimate of our incurred losses ceded to nico  net of underlying reinsurance  by million to billion  which is within the billion coverage provided by the nico cover 
the increase in the estimate of incurred a e losses was principally driven by raised projections for claims related to asbestos 
based on the results of the study  we believe that  under all reasonable scenarios  ultimate incurred losses will not exceed the nico cover 
due to the nico cover  there was no impact to income or equity from the change in estimate 
as part of our previously described actuarial review process  we review a e activity each quarter and compare that activity to what was assumed in the most recently completed study 
as of december   we noted no change in the range of reasonable outcomes around our best estimate described above 
as noted above  we have ceded estimated incurred losses of approximately billion to the nico cover at december  since entering into the nico cover  approximately of the billion of utilized coverage relates to uncollectible third party recoverables and settlements on third party recoverables through december  net losses paid totaled billion as of december   with million paid in asbestos payments during reflect payments resulting from intensified efforts by claimants to resolve asbestos claims prior to the potential enactment of us federal asbestos legislation 
to the extent that actual experience differs from our estimate of incurred a e losses and third party recoverables  future losses could exceed the million of protection remaining under the nico cover 
our reserves for a e losses  net of third party recoverables but prior to nico recoveries  were billion at december  an industry benchmark of reserve adequacy is the survival ratio  computed as a company s reserves divided by its historical average yearly loss payments 
this ratio indicates approximately how many more years of payments the reserves can support  assuming future yearly payments are equal to historical levels 
our survival ratio was at december  this was computed as the ratio of a e reserves  net of third party recoverables prior to the nico cover of billion plus the remaining unused portion of the nico cover of million  to the average a e loss payments over the three year period ended december   net of third party recoverables 
our survival ratio was at december  we believe that as a result of the nico cover and our historical third party reinsurance programs  we should not experience material financial loss from a e exposures under current coverage interpretations and that our survival ratio compares favorably to industry survival ratios 
however  the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid using recent annual average payments 
many factors  such as aggressive settlement procedures  mix of business and coverage provided  have a significant effect on the amount of a e reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio 
thus  caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio 

table of contents our reserves for a e losses at december  represent management s best estimate of its ultimate liability based on information currently available 
however  significant uncertainties  including but not limited to case law developments  medical and clean up cost increases and industry settlement practices  limit our ability to accurately estimate ultimate liability and we may be subject to a e losses beyond currently estimated amounts 
in addition  we remain liable for risks reinsured in the event that a reinsurer does not honor its obligations under reinsurance contracts 
see note reserves for unpaid loss and lae asbestos and environmental loss and lae reserve activity of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our a e reserves 
insurance operations a e claims activity our a e claims activity  which is all in our insurance operations segment  for the last two years is illustrated in the table below year ended december  asbestos accounts with asbestos claims at the beginning of the year accounts reporting asbestos claims during the year accounts on which asbestos claims were closed during the year accounts with asbestos claims at the end of the year environmental accounts with environmental claims at the beginning of the year accounts reporting environmental claims during the year accounts on which environmental claims were closed during the year accounts with environmental claims at the end of the year total total accounts with a e claims at the beginning of the year accounts reporting a e claims during the year accounts on which a e claims were closed during the year total accounts with a e claims at the end of the year insurance operations reserve estimation by line of business the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it must consider many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events 
as a result  informed subjective estimates and judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process 
we  like other insurance companies  categorize and track our insurance reserves by line of business  such as automobile liability  multiple peril package business  and workers compensation 
furthermore  we regularly review the appropriateness of reserve levels at the line of business level  considering the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims for the subsets of claims in each particular line of business 
for loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserves  excluding a e  the key assumption as of december  was that the impact of the various reserving factors  as described below  on future 
table of contents paid losses would be similar to the impact of those factors on the historical loss data with the following exceptions recent increases in paid loss trends were inflated due to changes in claim handling procedure that decreased the settlement time for claims 
this resulted in some increases in paid loss activity that we believe will not continue into the future 
increases in case reserve adequacy over the calendar periods have resulted in trends in case incurred activity that we believe will not continue into the future 
case incurred activity can be the result of underlying changes in expected claim costs or changes in the adequacy of the case reserves relative to the underlying expected claim cost 
if the activity is the result of underlying changes in expected costs  it is more likely to repeat in the future  and would likely result in prior year reserve development  as the change in ultimate claim costs would not have been considered when making the previous selection of ibnr reserves 
if the activity is the result of changes in case reserve adequacy  it would not indicate any change in the ultimate claim costs and would not be expected to repeat in the future 
in these cases  it is unlikely that prior year reserve development would occur  as the change in case reserves would be offset by a corresponding change in ibnr reserves ie  deficiency or redundancy in case reserves was implicitly captured when making the previous selection of ibnr reserves 
in  we established a separate claim group to manage run off claims 
due to the nature of this event  we do not believe that the impacts of this group on future losses have been reflected in historical losses 
therefore  we have given considerable weight to the most recent loss experience for this segment 
the major causes of material uncertainty reserving factors generally will vary for each product line  as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line 
the following section details reserving factors by product line 
there could be other reserving factors that may impact ultimate claim costs 
each reserving factor presented will have a different impact on estimated reserves 
also  reserving factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on estimated reserves 
for example  in workers compensation  the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster  thereby lowering indemnity costs 
thus  in almost all cases  it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single reserving factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation 
actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions  resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently 
workers compensation workers compensation covers an employer s liability for injuries  disability or death of employees  without regard to fault  as prescribed by state workers compensation law and other statutes 
workers compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage  as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year 
while certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly  some other payments are made over the course of several years  such as awards for permanent partial injuries 
in addition  some payments can run as long as the injured worker s life  such as permanent disability benefits and ongoing medical care 
despite the possibility of long payment tails  the reporting lags are generally short  settlements are generally not complex  and most of the liability can be considered high frequency with moderate severity 
the largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency  high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a worker s injury 

table of contents examples of common reserving factors that can change and  thus  affect the estimated workers compensation reserves include general workers compensation reserving factors mortality trends of injured workers with lifetime benefits and medical treatment or dependents entitled to survivor benefits degree of cost shifting between workers compensation and health insurance changes in claim handling philosophies eg  case reserving standards indemnity reserving factors time required to recover from the injury degree of available transitional jobs degree of legal involvement changes in the interpretations and processes of various workers compensation bureaus oversight of claims future wage inflation for states that index benefits changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds re marriage rate for spouse in instances of death medical reserving factors changes in the cost of medical treatments  including prescription drugs  and underlying fee schedules frequency of visits to health providers number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers types of health providers used type of medical treatments received use of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices availability of new medical processes and equipment changes in the use of pharmaceutical drugs degree of patient responsiveness to treatment workers compensation book of business reserving factors product mix injury type mix changes in underwriting standards 
table of contents personal automobile liability automobile covers both physical damage and liability coverage 
automobile physical damage insurance covers loss or damage to vehicles from collision  vandalism  fire  theft or other causes 
automobile liability insurance covers bodily injury of others  damage to their property and costs of legal defense resulting from a collision caused by the insured 
the personal automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and  therefore  includes both short and long tail coverages 
the payments that are made quickly typically pertain to automobile physical damage property claims and property damage liability claims 
the payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims 
personal automobile reserves are typically analyzed in three components bodily injury liability  property damage liability  and collision comprehensive claims 
this last component has minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and  accordingly  separate factors are not presented 
reporting lags are relatively short and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products 
it is generally viewed as a high frequency  low to moderate severity product line 
examples of common reserving factors that can change and  thus  affect the estimated personal automobile liability reserves include personal automobile liability reserving factors trends in jury awards changes in the underlying court system and its philosophy changes in case law litigation trends frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits change in average severity of accidents  or proportion of severe accidents subrogation opportunities degree of patient responsiveness to treatment changes in claim handling philosophies eg  case reserving standards personal automobile liability book of business reserving factors changes in policy provisions eg  deductibles  policy limits  or endorsements changes in underwriting standards multiple peril multiple peril represents a package policy sold to insureds or to members of trade associations or other groups that include general liability and property insurance 
general liability covers businesses for any liability resulting from bodily injury and property damage arising from general business operations  accidents on a premises and the products manufactured or sold 
property covers losses to a business premises  inventory and equipment as a result of weather  fire  theft and other causes 
because commercial multiple peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses  it includes both short and long tail coverages 
for property coverage  it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims  while for the other coverages  generally for the liability coverages  it takes a longer period of time to close claims 
the reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product  except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses 

table of contents multiple peril liability reserves here are generally analyzed as two components bodily injury and property damage 
bodily injury payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder s legal obligation arising from non intentional acts such as negligence  subject to the insurance policy provisions 
in some cases the damages can include future wage loss which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation and future medical treatment costs 
property damage payments result from damages to the claimant s private property arising from the policyholder s legal obligation for non intentional acts 
in most cases  property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date  or soon thereafter 
defense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant  sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims  though for some products this risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs erodes the amount of policy limit available to pay the claim 
multiple peril liability is generally considered a long tail line  as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year 
the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided and the jurisdiction  among other factors 
there are numerous components underlying the multiple peril liability product line 
some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within to years  while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims eg  a reporting lag of a decade for construction defect claims

homeowners farmowners homeowners farmowners is generally considered a short tail coverage 
most payments are related to the property portion of the policy  where the claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer 
claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs  although delays of several months are not unusual 
the resulting settlement 
table of contents process is typically fairly short term  although exceptions do exist 
the liability portion of the homeowners farmowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation  but with generally small reporting lags 
overall  the line is generally high frequency  low to moderate severity except for catastrophes  with simple to moderate claim complexity 
examples of common reserving factors that can change and  thus  affect the estimated homeowners farmowners reserves include non catastrophe reserving factors salvage opportunities amount of time to return property to residential use changes in weather patterns local building codes litigation trends trends in jury awards catastrophe reserving factors physical concentration of policyholders availability and cost of local contractors local building codes quality of construction of damaged homes amount of time to return property to residential use for the more severe catastrophic events  demand surge inflation  whereby the greatly increased demand for building materials such as plywood far surpasses the immediate supply  leading to short term material increases in building material costs homeowners farmowners book of business reserving factors policy provisions mix eg  deductibles  policy limits  or endorsements degree of concentration of policyholders changes in underwriting standards insurance operations loss and lae development loss and lae development in  we experienced million of favorable loss and lae reserve development on prior accident year loss reserves

insurance operations case and ibnr reserves by line of business loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses  by line of business at december  and for our insurance operations were as follows december  december  case ibnr total case ibnr total in millions workers compensation personal automobile liability multiple peril commercial automobile liability general liability homeowners farmowners other total includes loss and lae reserves related to a e

insurance operations range of reserves by line of business our range of reserve estimates at december  was evaluated to consider the strengths and weaknesses of the actuarial methods applied against our historical claims experience data 
the following table shows the recorded reserves and the high and low ends of our range of reasonable loss 
table of contents and lae reserve estimates at december  the high and low ends of our range of reserve estimates in the table below are based on the results of various actuarial methods described above 
december  low recorded high in millions workers compensation personal automobile liability multiple peril commercial automobile liability general liability homeowners farmowners other total the recorded reserves represent management s best estimate of unpaid loss and lae by line of business 
we use the results of several different actuarial methods to develop our estimate of ultimate reserves 
while we have not determined the statistical probability of actual ultimate paid losses falling within the range  management believes that it is reasonably likely that actual ultimate paid losses will fall within the ranges noted above because the ranges were developed by using several different generally accepted actuarial methods 
the probability that ultimate losses will fall outside of the ranges of estimates by line of business is higher for each line of business individually than it is for the sum of the estimates for all lines taken together due to the effects of diversification 
the diversification effects result from the fact that losses across our different lines of business are not completely correlated 
although management believes our reserves are reasonably stated  ultimate losses may deviate  perhaps materially  from the recorded reserve amounts and could be above the high end of the range of actuarial projections 
this is because ranges are developed based on known events as of the valuation date  whereas the ultimate disposition of losses is subject to the outcome of events and circumstances that may be unknown as of the valuation date 
the percentages shown in the following table represent the linear interpolation of where our recorded loss and lae reserves are within the range of reserves estimates by line of business at december  and  where the low end of the range equals zero  the middle of the range equals and the high end of the range equals december  expressed as a percentage of the range workers compensation personal automobile liability multiple peril commercial automobile liability general liability homeowners farmowners other total 
table of contents during  management continued to see actuarial methods based on case incurred data produce lower estimated losses for the longer tailed lines of business 
however  due to the nature of these lines and the inherent risks in estimating the longer tailed lines of business  management chose to record losses higher in the range for workers compensation and multiple peril 
in  management began to see higher than anticipated paid loss and lae for personal automobile liability which had resulted in increases in the methods used to develop the ranges 
however  at year end  management believed that the ultimate losses would not increase as much as the models had suggested resulting in a recorded reserve lower in the range 
during  the increased estimates persisted and management adjusted the held reserves higher in the range 
overall  management is concerned about the impact of future increases in inflation  including adverse changes in tort liability 
these types of changes would result in deterioration in the loss reserves  therefore  management has selected loss reserves somewhat higher relative to actuarial indications than in previous years 
sensitivity analysis the following discussion includes disclosure of possible variations from current estimates of loss reserves due to a change in certain key assumptions 
each of the impacts described below is estimated individually  without consideration for any correlation among key assumptions or among lines of business 
therefore  it would be inappropriate to take each of the amounts described below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for our reserves in total 
it is important to note that the variations discussed are not meant to be a worst case scenario  and therefore  it is possible that future variations may be more than amounts discussed below 
workers compensation recorded reserves for workers compensation were million at december  the two most important assumptions for workers compensation reserves are loss development factors and loss cost trends  particularly medical cost inflation 
loss development patterns are dependent on medical cost inflation 
approximately half of the workers compensation net reserves are related to future medical costs 
across the entire reserve base  a point change in calendar year medical inflation would have changed the estimated net reserve by approximately million at december   in either direction 
professional liability recorded reserves for professional liability were million at december  a key assumption for professional liability is the implicit loss cost trend  particularly the severity inflation trend component of loss costs 
across the entire reserve base  a point change in assumed annual severity would have changed the estimated net reserve by approximately million at december   in either direction 
multiple peril liability recorded reserves for multiple peril were million at december  reported loss development patterns are a key assumption for these lines of business  particularly for more mature accident years 
historically  assumptions on reported loss development patterns have been impacted by  among other things  emergence of new types of claims eg construction defect claims or a shift in the mixture between smaller  more routine claims and larger  more complex claims 
if case reserve adequacy for non construction defect claims changed by points this would have changed the estimated net reserve by approximately million at december   in either direction 
reinsurance transactions our insurance subsidiaries purchase reinsurance from time to time to protect their businesses from losses due to exposure aggregation  to manage their operating leverage ratios and to limit ultimate losses arising from catastrophic events 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner 
table of contents consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policies 
amounts related to reinsurance contracts are recorded in accordance with asc in connection with the onebeacon acquisition  aviva caused us to purchase reinsurance contracts with two reinsurance companies rated aa very strong  the second highest of twenty one financial strength ratings by standard poor s and a superior  the highest of fifteen financial strength ratings by am best 
one is a reinsurance cover with nico which entitles us to recover up to billion in ultimate loss and lae incurred related to asbestos claims arising from business written by our predecessor prior to  environmental claims arising from business written by our predecessor prior to and certain other latent exposures 
as of december   we have ceded estimated incurred losses of approximately billion to nico under the nico cover 
the other contract is a reinsurance cover with grc for up to million of additional losses on all claims arising from accident years and prior 
as of december   we have ceded estimated incurred losses of million to grc under the grc cover 
the nico cover and grc cover  which were contingent on and occurred contemporaneously with the onebeacon acquisition  were put in place in lieu of a seller guarantee of loss and lae reserves and are therefore accounted for as a seller guarantee under gaap 
nico and grc are wholly owned subsidiaries of berkshire hathaway 
the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables is subject to the solvency and willingness to pay of the reinsurer 
we are selective in choosing our reinsurers  placing reinsurance principally with those reinsurers with a strong financial condition  industry ratings and underwriting ability 
management monitors the financial condition and ratings of our reinsurers on an ongoing basis 
see note reinsurance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on our reinsurance programs 
purchase accounting when we acquire another company  our management must estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired  in accordance with gaap at the time of the acquisition 
see note nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies recent accounting pronouncements of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
certain assets and liabilities require little judgment to estimate their fair values  particularly those that are quoted on a market exchange  such as publicly traded investment securities 
other assets and liabilities  however  require a substantial amount of judgment to estimate their fair values 
the most significant of these is the estimation required to fair value loss and lae reserves 
we estimate the fair value of loss and lae reserves obtained in an acquisition following the principles contained within fasb statement of financial accounting concepts no 
using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements con 
under con  the fair value of a particular asset or liability essentially contains five elements an estimate of the future cash flows  expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those cash flows  the time value of money  represented by the risk free rate of interest  the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent in the asset or liability  and other  sometimes unidentifiable  factors including illiquidity and market imperfections 
our actuaries estimate the fair value of loss and lae reserves obtained in an acquisition by taking the acquired company s recorded reserves and discounting them based on expected reserve payout patterns using the current risk free rate of interest 
then  our actuaries develop additional cash flow scenarios that use different payout and ultimate reserve assumptions deemed to be reasonably possible based upon the inherent uncertainties present in determining the amount and timing of payment of such reserves 
in each scenario  the risk free rate of interest is used to discount future cash flows 
these scenarios are put in a statistical model that assigns a probability to each cash flow scenario 
our actuaries then choose the scenario that best represents the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent within the acquired company s recorded reserves 
the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent within the acquired company s reserves is measured as the difference between the selected cash flow 
table of contents scenario and the expected cash flow scenario 
the scenario selected has typically been between and standard deviations from the expected cash flow outcome 
the fair value of the acquired company s loss and lae reserves is determined to be the sum of the expected cash flow scenario ie  the acquired company s discounted loss and lae reserves and the uncertainty price 
the difference between an acquired company s loss and lae reserves and our best estimate of the fair value of such reserves at the acquisition date is amortized ratably over the payout period of the acquired loss and lae reserves 
historically  the fair value of an acquired company s loss and lae reserves has been less than its nominal reserves at acquisition 
accordingly  the amortization has been and will continue to be recorded as an expense on our income statement until fully amortized 
in connection with purchase accounting for the onebeacon acquisition  we were required to adjust to fair value our loss and lae reserves and the related reinsurance recoverables by million and million  respectively  on onebeacon s acquired balance sheet as of june  this net reduction to loss and lae reserves of million is being accreted through an income statement charge ratably with and over the period the claims are settled

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risk 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and other relevant market rates and prices 
due to our sizable balances of interest rate sensitive instruments  market risk can have a significant effect on onebeacon s consolidated financial position 
interest rate risk fixed maturity and convertible bond portfolios 
in connection with our consolidated insurance subsidiaries  we invest in interest rate sensitive securities  primarily debt securities 
our strategy is to purchase fixed maturity investments and convertible bonds that are attractively priced in relation to perceived credit risks 
upon adoption of asc on january   our portfolio of fixed maturity investments held for general investment purposes were reclassified as trading securities which are reported at fair value as of the balance sheet date as determined by quoted market prices when available 
realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on trading securities are reported pre tax in revenues 
prior to adoption of asc  our fixed maturity investments were held as available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  subsequently codified within asc  whereby these investments were carried at fair value on the balance sheet with net unrealized gains or losses reported net of tax as a separate component of onebeacon s shareholders equity 
upon adoption of asc  our convertible bonds are carried at fair value with changes therein recorded in revenues as unrealized investment gains or losses 
prior to adoption  our convertible bonds were held as available for sale and were carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through income as realized investment gains or losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid instruments  subsequently codified within asc we generally manage our interest rate risk associated with our portfolio of fixed maturity investments and convertible bonds by monitoring the average duration of the portfolio  which allows us to achieve an adequate yield without subjecting the portfolio to an unreasonable level of interest rate risk 
our fixed maturity and convertible bond portfolios are comprised of primarily investment grade corporate securities  us government and agency securities  municipal obligations and mortgage backed securities eg  those receiving an investment grade rating from standard poor s or moody s 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of fixed maturity and convertible bond investments  respectively 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 

table of contents the table below summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in market interest rates on our fixed maturity and convertible bond investments and pension fixed maturity and convertible bond investments fair value at december  assumed change in relevant interest rate estimated fair value after change in interest rate after tax increase decrease in carrying value in millions fixed maturity and convertible bond investments  bp decrease  bp decrease  bp increase  bp increase  qualified pension plan fixed maturity investments bp decrease bp decrease bp increase bp increase long term obligations 
as of december   our interest and dividend bearing long term obligations consisted primarily of the senior notes which have a fixed interest rate 
as a result  our exposure to interest rate risk resulting from variable interest rate obligations is insignificant 
the senior notes were issued in and mature on may  at december   the fair value of the senior notes was million  which compared to a carrying value of million 
the fair value of this obligation was estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market rates for similar obligations or using quoted market prices 
credit spread risk sensitivity analysis of spread risk our overall fixed maturity investment strategy is to purchase securities that are attractively priced in relation to credit risks 
widening and tightening of spreads generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of fixed maturity investments 
the table below summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical widening and tightening of spreads for different classes of our fixed maturity and convertible bond portfolios 
in estimating the impact of hypothetical tightening of spreads  for fixed maturity investments yielding more than the year constant maturity treasury index cmt index as of september   to the extent their yields would have decreased to levels lower than the year cmt index as of september   we limited their price appreciation to a level equal to the yield

for fixed maturity investments yielding less than the year cmt index as of december   we assumed no price appreciation

market prices of common equity securities  in general  are subject to fluctuations which could cause the amount to be realized upon sale or exercise of the instruments to differ significantly from the current reported value 
the fluctuations may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative price of alternative investments  general market conditions and supply and demand imbalances for a particular security 

table of contents sensitivity analysis of likely changes in fair values of common equity securities  hedge fund and private equity fund investments our investment portfolio includes investments in common equity securities  hedge funds and private equity funds 
the underlying investments of the hedge funds and private equity funds are typically publicly traded and private common equity investments  and  as such  are subject to market risks that are similar to those in our common equity portfolio 
the following illustrates the estimated effect on december  fair values resulting from hypothetical changes in market value change in fair value decline increase decline increase in millions common equity securities hedge funds private equity funds returns on common equity securities are measured against the s p index 
hedge funds and private equity funds returns are commonly measured against the benchmark returns of hedge fund indices and or the s p index 
the hedge fund research  inc hfrx equal weighted strategies index is representative of the overall composition of the hedge fund market and is comprised of typical hedge fund strategies  including convertible arbitrage  distressed securities  equity hedge  equity market neutral  event driven  macro  merger arbitrage and relative value arbitrage 
the hfrx equal weighted strategies index applies an equal weight to all constituent strategy indices 
the historical returns for each index in the past full years are listed below year ended december  hfrx equal weighted strategies index s p index foreign currency exchange rates our investments denominated in foreign currencies are valued using period end exchange rates and our net investment income on foreign denominated securities are valued using average exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur losses on a us dollar basis due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   we held million in bonds denominated in foreign currencies  mostly in british pounds and australian dollars 
assuming a hypothetical increase or decrease in the rate of exchange from the british pound and australian dollar to the us dollar as of december   the carrying value of our foreign currency denominated bond portfolio would have respectively decreased or increased by million
