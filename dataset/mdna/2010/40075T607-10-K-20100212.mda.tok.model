item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
our small to medium sized business target markets may have fewer financial resources to weather a downturn in the economy we target the banking and financial services needs of small and medium sized businesses 
these businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital borrowing capacity than larger entities 
if general economic conditions continue to negatively impact these businesses in the markets in which we operate  our business  financial condition  and results of operation could be adversely affected 
liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through traditional deposits  brokered deposit renewals or rollovers  secured or unsecured borrowings  the sale of securities or loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or the terms of which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets 
we rely on commercial and retail deposits  brokered deposit renewals and rollovers  advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb of topeka and other secured and unsecured borrowings to fund our operations 
although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary  we might not be able to replace such funds in the future if  among other things  our results of operations or financial condition or the results of operations or financial condition of the fhlb of topeka or market conditions were to change 
in addition  if we fall below the fdic s thresholds to be considered well capitalized  we will be unable to continue to rollover or renew brokered funds  and the interest rate paid on deposits would be restricted 
under the written agreement  our bank is required to submit a written plan to improve the bank s liquidity position  including measures to diversify funding sources and reduce reliance on brokered deposits 
the written agreements also restricts the bank from issuing new brokered deposits  but the bank can renew or rollover existing brokered deposits 
further  the written agreement prevents the company  but not the bank  from incurring  increasing or guaranteeing any debt without approval from the federal reserve 

table of contents although we consider the current sources of funds adequate for our liquidity needs  there can be no assurance in this regard and we may be compelled to seek additional sources of financing in the future 
likewise  the company may seek written approval from the federal reserve to issue additional debt in the future 
there can be no assurance that such written approval would be obtained for additional borrowings at the holding company level  or that the additional borrowings would be available to us or  if available  would be on favorable terms 
in addition  although we believe that the current level of cash at the holding company is sufficient to meet the operating needs of the holding company for over three years  assuming that the holding company does not contribute any additional amounts of capital to the bank  there can be no assurance in this regard and we may be compelled in the future to seek either additional capital or dividends from the bank to meet such needs 
there can be no assurance that we could raise additional capital or that written approval would be obtained from our regulators for any such dividends 
bank and holding company stock prices have been negatively affected by the recent adverse economic trend  as has the ability of banks and holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets compared to recent years 
if additional financing sources are unavailable or not available on reasonable terms  our financial condition  results of operations and future prospects could be materially adversely affected 
we actively monitor the depository institutions that hold our federal funds sold and due from banks cash balances 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal  and since september  nearly all of our overnight funding is held at the federal reserve in order to mitigate risk associated with holding large amounts of cash with other financial institutions 
nonetheless  we are currently not able to provide assurances that access to our cash equivalents and federal funds sold will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
from time to time  a portion of the balances in our accounts with financial institutions in the us may exceed the fdic insurance limits 
while we monitor and adjust the balances in our accounts as appropriate  these balances could be impacted if the financial institutions fail and could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
concern of customers over deposit insurance may cause a decrease in deposits with recent increased concerns about bank failures  customers increasingly are concerned about the extent to which their deposits are insured by the fdic 
customers may withdraw deposits in an effort to ensure that the amount they have on deposit with their bank is fully insured 
decreases in deposits may adversely affect our funding costs and net income 
our deposit insurance premiums have increased and could increase further in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our future earnings the fdic insures deposits at fdic insured financial institutions  including the bank 
the fdic charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund at a certain level 
current economic conditions have increased bank failures and expectations for further failures  in which case the fdic ensures payments of deposits up to insured limits from the deposit insurance fund 
in the first quarter of  the fdic increased all fdic deposit assessment rates by basis points 
beginning in the second quarter of  the base assessment rates were increased again and currently range from basis points for risk category i institutions to basis points for risk category iv institutions  subject to adjustments for brokered deposits  secured liabilities and a reduction for their unsecured debt 
during  the bank migrated to a risk category iii with a base assessment rate of basis points 

table of contents in addition  on may   the fdic adopted a final rule imposing a special assessment on all institutions of basis points for the second quarter of the bank accrued million for this special assessment as a liability and expense for the second quarter of the fdic may further increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule in order to manage the dif to prescribed statutory target levels 
an increase in the risk category for the bank or in the assessment rates could have an adverse effect on the bank s earnings 
the fdic may terminate deposit insurance if it determines the institution involved has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition  or has violated applicable laws  regulations or orders 
in the case of a colorado chartered bank  the termination of deposit insurance would result in the revocation of its charter 
we may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future  but capital may not be available when it is needed we are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
in addition  we may elect to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions  if any  or we may otherwise elect to raise additional capital 
in that regard  a number of financial institutions have recently raised considerable amounts of capital as a result of deterioration in their results of operations and financial condition arising from the turmoil in the mortgage loan market  deteriorating economic conditions  declines in real estate values and other factors  which may diminish our ability to raise additional capital 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets  economic conditions and a number of other factors  many of which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot be assured of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
the value of securities in our investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by continued disruptions in securities markets the market for some of the investment securities held in our portfolio has become volatile over the past two years 
volatile market conditions may detrimentally affect the value of these securities  such as through reduced valuations due to the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks 
there can be no assurance that the declines in market value associated with these disruptions will not result in other than temporary impairments of these assets  which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us since mid  the financial services industry as a whole  as well as the securities markets generally  have been materially and adversely affected by very significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a very serious lack of liquidity 
financial institutions in particular have been subject to increased volatility and an overall loss in investor confidence 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other institutional clients 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services companies  or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
many 
table of contents of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination 
any change in the laws or regulations applicable to us  or in banking regulators supervisory policies or examination procedures  whether by the colorado division of banking  the fdic  the federal reserve board  other state or federal regulators  the us congress or the colorado legislature could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the bank is subject to regulations promulgated by the colorado division of banking  as its chartering authority  and by the fdic as the insurer of its deposits up to certain limits 
the bank also belongs to the federal home loan bank system and  as a member  it is subject to certain limited regulations promulgated by the federal home loan bank of topeka 
in addition  the federal reserve board regulates and oversees guaranty bancorp as a bank holding company  and the bank  as a member of the federal reserve system 
this regulation and supervision limits the activities in which we may engage 
the purpose of regulation and supervision is primarily to protect the fdic s insurance fund and our depositors and borrowers  rather than our stockholders 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in the exercise of their supervisory and enforcement powers 
they may  among other things  impose restrictions on the operation of a banking institution  the classification of assets by such institution and such institution s allowance for loan losses 
regulatory and law enforcement authorities also have wide discretion and extensive enforcement powers under various consumer protection and civil rights laws  including the truth in lending act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair housing act  the real estate settlement procedures act  the red flag identity theft rules under the fair and accurate credit transactions act and colorado s deceptive acts and practices law 
these laws also permit private individual and class action lawsuits and provide for the recovery of attorneys fees in certain instances 
given the current disruption in the financial markets and regulatory initiatives that are likely to be proposed by the new administration and congress  new regulations and laws that may affect us are increasingly likely 
compliance with such regulations and laws may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
the written agreement also subjects us to additional restrictions and more frequent oversight 
no assurance can be given that the foregoing regulations and supervision will not change so as to affect us adversely 
there can be no assurance that the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa and other government programs will stabilize the us financial system on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was enacted 
the us treasury and banking regulators implemented a number of continuing programs under this legislation and otherwise to address capital and liquidity issues in the banking system  including the tarp capital purchase program  the fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program tlg program and transaction account guarantee program  an increase to fdic insurance coverage for most accounts  among other programs 
there can also be no assurance as to the actual impact that the eesa and other programs will continue to have on the financial markets  including credit availability 
the failure of the eesa and other programs to stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial 
table of contents market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit or the trading price of our common stock 
our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the colorado front range our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the counties in which we conduct business 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the colorado front range  which includes the denver metropolitan area 
the local economic conditions in our market area have a significant impact on our loans  the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation  natural disasters  recession  unemployment or other factors beyond our control would affect these local economic conditions and could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
further deterioration in economic conditions  in particular within our primary market areas  could result in the following consequences  among others  any of which could hurt our business materially loan delinquencies on real estate  commercial and consumer loans may increase  problem assets and foreclosures may increase  demand for our products and services may decline  and collateral for loans made by us  especially real estate  may decline in value  in turn reducing a customer s borrowing power and reducing the value of assets and collateral securing our loans 
in view of the concentration of our operations and the collateral securing our loan portfolio in colorado s front range  we may be particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of any of these consequences  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional  and community banks within the various markets we serve 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
additionally  we expect competition to intensify among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions and the conversion of certain investment banks to bank holding companies 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic funds transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets 
the ability to expand our market position 
the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands 

table of contents the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors 
customer satisfaction with our level of service 
industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we rely on dividends from our subsidiary for most of our revenue because we are a holding company with no significant assets other than the bank  we currently depend upon dividends from the bank for a substantial portion of our revenues 
our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders will therefore continue to depend in large part upon our receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from the bank 
our ability to pay dividends is subject to the restrictions of the delaware general corporation law 
various banking laws applicable to the bank limit the payment of dividends  management fees and other distributions by the bank to the company  and may therefore limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
in addition  the written agreement prohibits both the company and the bank from paying dividends without the prior written approval of the federal reserve  and  in the case of the bank  the cdb 
accordingly  our ability to receive dividends from the bank  as well as our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders will be restricted until the written agreement is terminated 
from time to time  we may become a party to financing agreements or other contractual arrangements that have the effect of limiting or prohibiting us or our bank subsidiary from declaring or paying dividends 
see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities dividends for more information on these restrictions 
although we believe that the current level of cash at the holding company is sufficient to meet the operating needs of the holding company for over three years  assuming that the holding company does not contribute any additional amounts of capital to the bank  there can be no assurance in this regard and we may be compelled in the future to seek either additional capital or dividends from the bank to meet such needs 
there can be no assurance that we could raise additional capital or that written approval would be obtained from our regulators for any such dividends 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel could harm our business competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of and experience in the colorado community banking industry 
the process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategies is often lengthy 
our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  loan origination  administrative  marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of our management and personnel 
in particular  our success is highly dependent upon the abilities of our senior executive management 
we believe this management team  comprised of individuals who have worked in the banking industry for many years  is integral to implementing our business plan 
the loss of the services of one or more of them could harm our business 
under the terms of the written agreement  prior written approval from the federal reserve must be obtained prior to appointing any new director or senior executive officer  or changing the responsibilities of any senior executive officer so that the officer would assume a different senior 
table of contents executive officer position 
there is no assurance that written approval would be granted to appoint any new director or senior executive officer  or to change the responsibilities of any senior executive officer 
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we are subject to security and operational risks relating to our use of technology that could damage our reputation and our business we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
additionally  we outsource our data processing to a third party 
if our third party provider encounters difficulties or if we have difficulty in communicating with such third party  it will significantly affect our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions  which would significantly affect our business operations 
furthermore  breaches of such third party s technology may also cause reimbursable loss to our consumer and business customers  through no fault of our own 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of information systems used to process customer transactions could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we continually encounter technological change the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility from time to time  customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities 
whether customer claims and legal action related to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded  if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us  they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand

investors who purchase our common stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our common stock 
such a concentration of ownership may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control and may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we face risks associated with acquisitions or mergers we may pursue or be a party to an acquisition or merger opportunity in the future 
risks commonly encountered in mergers and acquisitions include  among other things the difficulty of integrating the operations  systems and personnel of acquired companies and branches 
the potential disruption of our ongoing business 
the potential diversion of our management s time and attention 
the inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position by the successful implementation of uniform product offerings and the incorporation of uniform technology into our product offerings and control systems 
the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management

we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with mergers or acquisitions 
our integration of operations of banks or branches that we acquire may not be successfully accomplished and may take a significant amount of time 
our inability to improve the operating performance of acquired banks and branches or to integrate successfully or in a timely manner their operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we would expect to hire additional employees and or retain consultants to assist with integrating our operations  and we cannot assure that those individuals or firms will perform as expected or be successful in addressing these issues

severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business 
such events could affect the stability of our deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue and or cause us to incur additional expenses

we offer an array of banking products and services to the communities we serve  including accepting time and demand deposits and originating commercial loans including energy loans  real estate loans  small business administration guaranteed loans and consumer loans 
we derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related loans  commercial loans and leases and consumer loans and  to a lesser extent  interest on investment securities  fees received in connection with servicing loan and deposit accounts and fees from trust services 
our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses 
we rely primarily on locally generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans 
we are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results  like those of other financial institutions operating exclusively or primarily in colorado  are significantly influenced by economic conditions in colorado  including the strength of the real estate market 
in addition  both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as detailed in item business  centennial bank holdings  inc became guaranty bancorp effective may  guaranty bancorp has a single bank subsidiary  guaranty bank and trust company 
this structure is a result of a combination of four separate acquisitions in and and two divestitures in application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates our accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported 
our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and consistently applied from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies that we believe are critical or involve significant management judgment 
allowance for loan losses the loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet 
we determine probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio and establish an allowance for those losses by considering factors including historical loss rates  expected cash flows and estimated collateral values 
in assessing these factors  we use organizational history and experience with credit decisions and related outcomes 
the allowance for loan losses represents our best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
we evaluate our allowance for loan losses 
table of contents quarterly 
if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate based on subsequent loss evaluations  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted 
we estimate the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses by separately evaluating impaired and nonimpaired loans 
a specific allowance is assigned to an impaired loan when expected cash flows or collateral do not justify the carrying amount of the loan 
the methodology used to assign an allowance to a nonimpaired loan is more subjective 
generally  the allowance assigned to nonimpaired loans is determined by applying historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics  adjusted for qualitative factors including the volume and severity of identified classified loans  changes in economic conditions  changes in credit policies or underwriting standards  and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets 
because the economic and business climate in any given industry or market  and its impact on any given borrower  can change rapidly  the risk profile of the loan portfolio is continually assessed and adjusted when appropriate 
notwithstanding these procedures  there still exists the possibility that our assessment could prove to be significantly incorrect and that an immediate adjustment to the allowance for loan losses would be required 
we estimate the appropriate level of loan loss allowance by conducting a detailed review of a number of smaller portfolio segments that comprise our loan portfolios 
we segment the loan portfolio into as many components as practical 
each component would normally have similar characteristics  such as risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving  while the risk profile of others may be deteriorating 
as a result  changes in the appropriate level of the allowance for different segments may offset one another 
adjustments to the allowance represent the aggregate impact from the analysis of all loan segments 
other real estate owned and foreclosed assets other real estate owned or other foreclosed assets acquired through loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired  establishing a new cost basis 
the adjustment at the time of foreclosure is recorded through the allowance for loan losses 
due to the subjective nature of establishing the fair value when the asset is acquired  the actual fair value of the other real estate owned or foreclosed asset could differ from the original estimate 
if it is determined that fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure  a valuation allowance is recorded through noninterest expense 
operating costs associated with the assets after acquisition are also recorded as noninterest expense 
gains and losses on the disposition of other real estate owned and foreclosed assets are netted and posted to other noninterest income 
investment in debt and equity securities we classify our investments in debt and equity securities as either held to maturity or available for sale 
securities classified as held to maturity are recorded at cost or amortized cost 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value 
fair value calculations are based on quoted market prices when such prices are available 
if quoted market prices are not available  estimates of fair value are computed using a variety of techniques  including extrapolation from the quoted prices of similar instruments or recent trades for thinly traded securities  fundamental analysis  or through obtaining purchase quotes 
due to the subjective nature of the valuation process  it is possible that the actual fair values of these investments could differ from the estimated amounts  thereby affecting our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if the estimated value of investments is less than the cost or amortized cost  we evaluate whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
if such an event or change has occurred and we determine that the impairment is other than temporary  we expense the impairment of the investment in the period in which the event or change occurred 

table of contents deferred income tax assets liabilities our net deferred income tax asset arises from differences in the dates that items of income and expense enter into our reported income and taxable income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for these items as they arise 
from an accounting standpoint  deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on both positive and negative evidence currently available 
positive evidence includes the historical levels of our taxable income  estimates of our future taxable income including tax planning strategies  the reversals of deferred tax liabilities and taxes available in carry back years 
negative evidence primarily includes a cumulative three year loss for financial reporting purposes 
additionally  current and future economic and business conditions are considered 
additionally  the company reviews its uncertain tax positions annually 
an uncertain tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination  with a tax examination being presumed to occur 
the amount actually recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely to be recognized on examination 
for tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test  no tax benefit is recorded 
a significant amount of judgment is applied to determine both whether the tax position meets the more likely than not test as well as to determine the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely to be recognized 
differences between the position taken by management and that of taxing authorities could result in a reduction of a tax benefit or increase to tax liability  which could adversely affect future income tax expense 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets core deposit and customer relationships  which are intangible assets with a finite life  are recorded on our balance sheets 
these intangible assets were capitalized as a result of past acquisitions and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of up to years 
core deposit intangible assets  with finite lives will be tested for impairment when changes in events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
core deposits were tested for impairment during and  as part of the goodwill impairment test and no impairment was deemed necessary 
a separate evaluation was performed in and we determined that no impairment was necessary 
as a result of our acquisition activity  goodwill  an intangible asset with an indefinite life  was reflected on our balance sheet in prior periods 
goodwill was evaluated for impairment annually  except when there were factors present that indicated a potential impairment  in which case  the goodwill impairment test was performed more frequently than annually 
in  the entire balance of the goodwill asset was written off as impaired 
this discussion has highlighted those accounting policies that we consider to be critical to our financial reporting process 
however  all the accounting policies are important  and therefore you are encouraged to review each of the policies included in note to notes to consolidated financial statements in
