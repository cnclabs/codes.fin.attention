and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
executive summary we operate as a financial services and bank holding company 
through our broker dealer subsidiaries located throughout the united states  we provide securities brokerage services  including the sale of equities  mutual funds  fixed income products  and insurance  as well as offering banking products to their private clients through stifel bank  which provides residential  consumer  and commercial lending  as well as fdic insured deposit accounts to customers of our broker dealer subsidiaries and to the general public 
in addition  we provide securities brokerage  trading  and research services to institutions with an emphasis on the sale of equity and fixed income products 
we also manage and participate in underwritings for both corporate and public finance  merger and acquisition  and financial advisory services 
we plan to maintain our focus on revenue growth with a continued focus on developing quality relationships with our clients 
within our private client business  our efforts will be focused on recruiting experienced financial advisors with established client relationships 
within our capital markets business  our focus continues to be on providing quality client management and product diversification 
in executing our growth strategy  we will continue to look for opportunities to take advantage of the consolidation among middle market firms  which we believe provides us opportunities in our private client and capital markets businesses 
our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and productive employees is critical to the success of our business 
accordingly  compensation and benefits comprise the largest component of our expenses  and our performance is dependent upon our ability to attract  develop and retain highly skilled employees who are motivated and committed to providing the highest quality of service and guidance to our clients 
on march   we announced that stifel nicolaus had entered into a definitive agreement with ubs financial services inc ubs to acquire certain specified branches from the ubs wealth management americas branch network 
as subsequently amended  we agreed to acquire branches from ubs in four separate closings pursuant to this agreement 
we completed the acquisition on october  as a result of the acquisition  stifel nicolaus hired financial advisors and support staff in these branches and successfully converted approximately  accounts with approximately billion in customer assets  including related securities based and margin loans of million and billion in money market accounts and fdic insured balances to the stifel nicolaus platform 
our overall financial results continue to be highly and directly correlated to the direction and activity levels of the united states equity and fixed income markets  our expansion of the capital markets segment  and the continued expansion of our global wealth management segment 
despite the significant volatility in the market during the first half of  we began to see signs of improvement in the capital markets during the third and fourth quarters of at december   the key indicators of the markets performance  the dow jones industrial average  the nasdaq  and the s p closed   and  respectively  higher than their december  closing prices 
since december   we have added private client group offices and financial advisors  including offices and financial advisors from ubs and offices and financial advisors from butler wick  as part of our ongoing footprint expansion efforts 
in addition  we added revenue producing investment bankers  traders  institutional sales staff and lending officers along with branch and home office support staff 
results for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our net revenues increased to a record  million compared to million during the comparable period in  which represents our fourteenth consecutive annual increase in net revenues 
net income increased to a record million for the year ended december  compared to million during the comparable period in our revenue growth was primarily derived from increased principal transactions in institutional fixed income sales and trading resulting from turbulent markets  as institutions rebalanced their portfolios and their exposure to the market 
in addition  the market upheaval and the resultant failure of some wall street firms have led to increased market share of institutional business 
certain of our business activities  however  were impacted by the particularly challenging equity market conditions  which have led to a decrease in the value of our customers assets 
as a result  commissions  asset management and service fees  and margin interest income decreased during the year ended december  and may diminish in the future 
our business does not produce predictable earnings and is affected by many risk factors such as the global economic and credit slowdown  among others 
in addition to the increased market share that has resulted from market upheaval  we have incurred additional expenses related to increased securities investor protection corporation sipc assessments  higher fdic premiums  including special assessments  increased litigation costs due to the failure of certain financial institutions  and an increase in the cost of growth as we continue our expansion efforts 
these additional costs have reduced our profit margins and may continue to in the future if our revenue growth does not absorb the additional costs of operating in the current environment 
on december   we announced that stifel nicolaus had reached an agreement between the state of missouri  the state of indiana  the state of colorado and with an association of other state securities regulatory authorities regarding the repurchase of ars from eligible ars investors 
as part of the modified ars repurchase offer we have accelerated the previously announced repurchase plan 
we have agreed to repurchase ars from eligible ars investors in four phases starting in january and ending on december  during january  we repurchased at par ars of million 
at january   we estimate that our retail clients held million of eligible ars after issuer redemptions of million and stifel repurchases of million 
see item  legal proceedings  in part i of this report for further details regarding ars claims 
external factors impacting our business we are currently operating in a challenging environment a recession and financial services industry issues related to credit quality  auction rate securities and liquidity continue to negatively impact activity levels 
concerns regarding future economic growth and corporate earnings created challenging conditions for the equity markets  which experienced broad based declines  with equity indices starting to trend higher at the end of fixed income credit markets experienced high levels of volatility  though there were signs of improvement in credit market liquidity at the end of the third quarter 
the impact of these events marked a challenging environment for investment banking businesses with continued limited opportunities to distribute securities in the equity and debt capital markets 
performance in the financial services industry in which we operate is highly correlated to the overall strength of economic conditions and financial market activity 
overall market conditions are a product of many factors  which are beyond our control and mostly unpredictable 
these factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors  including their level of participation in the financial markets 
in turn  these decisions may affect our business results 
with respect to financial market activity  our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors  including the demand for investment banking services as reflected by the number and size of equity and debt financings and merger and acquisition transactions  the volatility of the equity and fixed income markets  the level and shape of various yield curves  the volume and value of trading in securities  and the value of our customers assets under management 
although we do not engage in significant proprietary trading for our own account  the inventory of securities held to facilitate customer trades and our market making activities are sensitive to market movements 
we do not have any significant direct exposure to the sub prime market  but are subject to market fluctuations resulting from news and corporate events in the sub prime mortgage markets  associated write downs by other financial services firms and interest rate fluctuations 
stock prices for companies in this industry  including stifel financial corp  have been volatile as a result of reactions to the global credit crisis and the continued volatility in the financial services industry 
we will continue to monitor our market capitalization and review for potential goodwill asset impairment losses if events or changes in circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount 
in connection with ars  our broker dealer subsidiaries have been subject to ongoing investigations  which include inquiries from the sec  finra and several state regulatory agencies  with which we are cooperating fully 
we are also named in a class action lawsuit similar to those filed against a number of brokerage firms alleging various securities law violations  which we are vigorously defending 
we are  in conjunction with other industry participants actively seeking a solution to ars illiquidity

these balances totaled  million at december  our liquidity requirements may change in the event we need to raise more funds than anticipated to increase inventory positions  support more rapid expansion  develop new or enhanced services and products  acquire technologies  or respond to other unanticipated liquidity requirements 
we rely exclusively on financing activities and distributions from our subsidiaries for funds to implement our business and growth strategies  and repurchase our shares 
net capital rules  restrictions under our borrowing arrangements of our subsidiaries  as well as the earnings  financial condition  and cash requirements of our subsidiaries  may each limit distributions to us from our subsidiaries 
in the event existing internal and external financial resources do not satisfy our needs  we may have to seek additional outside financing 
the availability of outside financing will depend on a variety of factors  such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the volume of trading activities  the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry  credit ratings  and credit capacity  as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of our long term or short term financial prospects if we incurred large trading losses or if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn or otherwise 
we currently do not have a credit rating  which could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position by increasing our borrowing costs and limiting access to sources of liquidity that require a credit rating as a condition to providing funds 
use of capital resources on december   we announced that stifel nicolaus had reached an agreement between the state of missouri  the state of indiana  the state of colorado and with an association of other state securities regulatory authorities regarding the repurchase of ars from eligible ars investors 
as part of the modified ars repurchase offer we have accelerated the previously announced repurchase plan 
we have agreed to repurchase ars from eligible ars investors in four phases starting in january and ending on december  during january  we repurchased million of ars at par 
at january   we estimate that our retail clients held million of eligible ars after issuer redemptions of million and stifel repurchases of million 
see item  legal proceedings  for further details regarding ars claims 
on march   we announced that stifel nicolaus had entered into a definitive agreement with ubs financial services inc ubs to acquire certain specified branches from the ubs wealth management americas branch network 
as subsequently amended  we agreed to acquire branches the acquired locations from ubs in four separate closings pursuant to this agreement 
we completed the closings on the following dates august   september   september  and october  this acquisition further expands our private client footprint 
the transaction was structured as an asset purchase for cash at a premium over certain balance sheet items  subject to adjustment 
the payments to ubs in conjunction with all four closings of million included i an upfront cash payment of million based on the actual number of branches and financial advisors acquired by stifel nicolaus  and ii aggregate payment of million for net fixed assets  employee forgivable loans and other assets  and iii securities based and margin loans of million that were collateralized by securities included in customer accounts converted to the stifel platform 
in addition  a contingent earn out payment is payable based on the performance of those ubs financial advisors who joined stifel nicolaus  over the two year period following the closing 
we utilize transition pay  principally in the form of upfront demand notes  to aid financial advisors  who have elected to join our firm  to supplement their lost compensation while transitioning their customers accounts to the stifel platform 
the initial value of the notes are determined primarily by the financial advisors trailing production and assets under management 
these notes are generally forgiven over a five to ten year period based on production 
the future estimated amortization expense of the upfront notes  assuming current year production levels and static growth for the years ended december      and thereafter are million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
these estimates could change if we continue to grow our business through expansion or experience increased production levels 
the following table summarizes the activity related to our company s demand note receivable from january  to december  in thousands december  december  beginning balance notes issued organic growth notes issued acquisitions amortization other ending balance notes issued in conjunction with our acquisition of ubs branches and butler wick in and  respectively 
we have paid million in the form of upfront notes to financial advisors for transition pay during  which includes million of upfront notes issued to ubs financial advisors as a form of transition pay 
as we continue to take advantage of the opportunities created by market displacement and as competition for skilled professionals in the industry increases  we may have to devote more significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
we paid a contingent earn out of million related to our acquisition of the lm capital markets business from citigroup inc during the second quarter of net capital requirements we operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to net capital requirements  which may limit distributions to our company from our broker dealer subsidiaries 
distributions from our broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to net capital rules 
these subsidiaries have historically operated in excess of minimum net capital requirements 
however  if distributions were to be limited in the future due to the failure of our subsidiaries to comply with the net capital rules or a change in the net capital rules  it could have a material and adverse affect to our company by limiting our operations that require intensive use of capital  such as underwriting or trading activities  or limit our ability to implement our business and growth strategies  pay interest on and repay the principal of our debt  and or repurchase our common stock 
our non broker dealer subsidiary  stifel bank is also subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
at december   stifel nicolaus had net capital of million  which was of its aggregate debit items  and million in excess of its minimum required net capital  csa had net capital of million  which was million in excess of its minimum required net capital 
at december   sn ltd had capital and reserves of million  which was million in excess of the financial resources requirement under the rules of the fsa 
at december   stifel bank was considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of our regulatory capital requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules that require us to make assumptions  judgments and estimates  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies and estimates have not differed materially from actual results 
for a full description of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
valuation of financial instruments we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis  including cash equivalents  trading securities owned  available for sale securities  investments and trading securities sold  but not yet purchased 
trading securities owned and pledged and trading securities sold  but not yet purchased  are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition  with unrealized gains and losses reflected on the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  or an exit price 
the degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment used in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less pricing observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models that require more judgment 
pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established  the characteristics specific to the transaction  and overall market conditions generally 
when available  we use observable market prices  observable market parameters  or broker or dealer quotes bid and ask prices to derive the fair value of financial instruments 
in the case of financial instruments transacted on recognized exchanges  the observable market prices represent quotations for completed transactions from the exchange on which the financial instrument is principally traded 
a substantial percentage of the fair value of our trading securities and other investments owned  trading securities pledged as collateral  and trading securities sold  but not yet purchased  are based on observable market prices  observable market parameters  or derived from broker or dealer prices 
the availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product 
where available  observable market prices and pricing or market parameters in a product may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment 
in certain markets  observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all products  and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product 
these techniques involve some degree of judgment 
for investments in illiquid or privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using the best information available 
among the factors we consider in determining the fair value of investments are the cost of the investment  terms and liquidity  developments since the acquisition of the investment  the sales price of recently issued securities  the financial condition and operating results of the issuer  earnings trends and consistency of operating cash flows  the long term business potential of the issuer  the quoted market price of securities with similar quality and yield that are publicly traded  and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments 
in instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions  the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price of a similar security without restriction but may be reduced by an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions 
the fair value of these investments is subject to a high degree of volatility and may be susceptible to significant fluctuation in the near term and the differences could be material 
we have categorized our financial instruments measured at fair value into a three level classification in accordance with asc  fair value measurement and disclosures 
fair value measurements of financial instruments that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are generally categorized as level i  and fair value measurements of financial instruments that have no direct observable levels are generally categorized as level iii 
all other fair value measurements of financial instruments that do not fall within the level i or level iii classification are considered level ii 
the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of a financial instrument is used to categorize the instrument and reflects the judgment of management 
level iii financial instruments have little to no pricing observability as of the report date 
these financial instruments do not have active two way markets and are measured using management s best estimate of fair value  where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation 
we have identified level iii financial instruments to include certain asset backed securities  consisting of collateral loan obligation securities  that have experienced low volumes of executed transactions  certain corporate bonds and equity securities where there was less frequent or nominal market activity and auction rate securities for which the market has been dislocated and largely ceased to function 
our level iii asset backed securities are valued using cash flow models that utilize unobservable inputs 
level iii corporate bonds are valued using prices from comparable securities 
equity securities with unobservable inputs are valued using management s best estimate of fair value  where the inputs require significant management judgment 
auction rate securities are valued based upon our expectations of issuer redemptions and using internal models 
at december   level iii assets for which we bear economic exposure were million or of the total assets measured at fair value 
during the year ended december   we recorded net purchases of million of level iii assets 
our valuation adjustments realized and unrealized reduced the value of our level iii assets by million 
in june  we began repurchasing eligible ars from our customers as part of our voluntary repurchase plan  which have been classified as level iii assets at december  at december   level iii assets for which we bear economic exposure were million or of the total assets measured at fair value 
during the year ended december   we recorded net sales of million of level iii assets 
our valuation adjustments realized and unrealized reduced the value of our level iii assets by million 
additionally  there were million of net transfers into the level iii category during the increase in net transfers is primarily attributable to reduced market volume and level of activity on some of our preferred and municipal auction rate securities 
at december   level iii assets included the following million of auction rate securities  million of asset backed securities and million of private equity and other fixed income securities 
contingencies we are involved in various pending and potential legal proceedings related to our business  including litigation  arbitration and regulatory proceedings 
some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts  including claims for punitive damages 
we have  after consultation with outside legal counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management  recorded estimated losses in accordance with asc asc  contingencies  to the extent that claims are probable of loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires us to use significant judgment and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
this determination is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are subject to potentially significant revision as more information becomes available and due to subsequent events 
in making these determinations  we consider many factors  including  but not limited to  the loss and damages sought by the plaintiff or claimant  the basis and validity of the claim  the likelihood of a successful defense against the claim  and the potential for  and magnitude of  damages or settlements from such pending and potential litigation and arbitration proceedings  and fines and penalties or orders from regulatory agencies 
see item  legal proceedings  in part i of this report for information on our legal  regulatory and arbitration proceedings 
allowance for doubtful receivables from former employees we offer transition pay  principally in the form of upfront loans  to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers as part of our overall growth strategy 
these loans are generally forgiven over a five to ten year period if the individual satisfies certain conditions  usually based on continued employment and certain performance standards 
if the individual leaves before the term of the loan expires or fails to meet certain performance standards  the individual is required to repay the balance 
in determining the allowance for doubtful receivables from former employees  we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding each receivable  including the amount of the unforgiven balance  the reasons for the terminated employment relationship  and the former employees overall financial position 
the loan balance from former employees at december  and december  was million and million  respectively  with associated loss allowances of million and million  respectively 
allowance for loan losses we regularly review the loan portfolio of stifel bank and have established an allowance for loan losses in accordance with asc the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to income 
in providing for the allowance for loan losses  we consider historical loss experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  we do not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment measurements 
in addition  impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and construction loans and a specific allowance established for individual loans determined to be impaired in accordance with asc receivables 
impairment is measured using the present value of the impaired loan s expected cash flow discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collectible 
factors considered in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
we determine the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
once a loan is determined to be impaired  usually when principal or interest becomes days past due or when collection becomes uncertain  the accrual of interest and amortization of deferred loan origination fees is discontinued non accrual status  and any accrued and unpaid interest income is written off 
loans placed on non accrual status are returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest payments are collected and the collectibility of future principal and interest payments is reasonably assured 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
derivative instruments and hedging activities stifel bank utilizes certain derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility 
our company s goal is to manage sensitivity to changes in rates by offsetting the repricing or maturity characteristics of certain assets and liabilities  thereby limiting the impact on earnings 
the use of derivative instruments does expose our company to credit and market risk 
we manage credit risk through strict counterparty credit risk limits and or collateralization agreements 
at inception  we determine if a derivative instrument meets the criteria for hedge accounting under asc  derivatives and hedging 
ongoing effectiveness evaluations are made for instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges 
if the derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting  no assessment of effectiveness is needed 
income taxes the provision for income taxes and related tax reserves is based on our consideration of known liabilities and tax contingencies for multiple taxing authorities 
known liabilities are amounts that will appear on current tax returns  amounts that have been agreed to in revenue agent revisions as the result of examinations by the taxing authorities and amounts that will follow from such examinations but affect years other than those being examined 
tax contingencies are liabilities that might arise from a successful challenge by the taxing authorities taking a contrary position or interpretation regarding the application of tax law to our tax return filings 
factors considered in estimating our liability are results of tax audits  historical experience  and consultation with tax attorneys and other experts 
asc asc  income taxes  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements and prescribed recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  asc provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
goodwill and intangible assets under the provisions of asc  business combinations  we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangible assets  at fair value 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities requires certain estimates 
at december   we had goodwill of million and intangible assets of million 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized 
rather  they are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment 
this test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities  identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount  a further test is required to measure the amount of the impairment 
we have elected to test for goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each calendar year 
the results of the impairment test performed as of july   our last annual measurement date  did not indicate any impairment 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including  among others  economic trends and market conditions  changes in revenue growth trends or business strategies  unanticipated competition  discount rates  technology  or government regulations 
in assessing the fair value of our reporting units  the volatile nature of the securities markets and industry requires us to consider the business and market cycle and assess the stage of the cycle in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows 
in addition to discounted cash flows  we consider other information such as public market comparables and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
identifiable intangible assets  which are amortized over their estimated useful lives  are tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management risks are an inherent part of our business and activities 
management of these risks is critical to our soundness and profitability 
risk management at our company is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment  and knowledge of financial products and markets 
our senior management group takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment  monitoring  and control of various risks 
the principal risks involved in our business activities are market interest rates and equity prices  credit  operational  and regulatory and legal 
market risk the potential for changes in the value of financial instruments owned by our company resulting from changes in interest rates and equity prices is referred to as market risk 
market risk is inherent to financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of our market risk management procedures includes all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
we trade tax exempt and taxable debt obligations  including us treasury bills  notes  and bonds  us government agency and municipal notes and bonds  bank certificates of deposit  mortgage backed securities  and corporate obligations 
we are also an active market maker in over the counter equity securities 
in connection with these activities  we may maintain inventories in order to ensure availability and to facilitate customer transactions 
changes in value of our financial instruments may result from fluctuations in interest rates  credit ratings  equity prices  and the correlation among these factors  along with the level of volatility 
we manage our trading businesses by product and have established trading departments that have responsibility for each product 
the trading inventories are managed with a view toward facilitating client transactions  considering the risk and profitability of each inventory position 
position limits in trading inventory accounts are established and monitored on a daily basis 
we monitor inventory levels and results of the trading departments  as well as inventory aging  pricing  concentration  and securities ratings 
we are also exposed to market risk based on our other investing activities 
these investments consist of investments in private equity partnerships  start up companies  venture capital investments and zero coupon us government securities and are included under the caption investments on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of maintaining inventories of interest rate sensitive financial instruments and from changes in the interest rates on our interest earning assets including client loans  stock borrow activities  investments  and inventories and our funding sources including client cash balances  stock lending activities  bank borrowings  and resale agreements  which finance these assets 
the collateral underlying financial instruments at the broker dealer is repriced daily  thus requiring collateral to be delivered as necessary 
interest rates on client balances and stock borrow and lending produce a positive spread to our company  with the rates generally fluctuating in parallel 
we manage our inventory exposure to interest rate risk by setting and monitoring limits and  where feasible  hedging with offsetting positions in securities with similar interest rate risk characteristics 
while a significant portion of our securities inventories have contractual maturities in excess of five years  these inventories  on average  turn over several times per year 
additionally  we monitor  on a daily basis  the value at risk var in our institutional capital markets trading portfolios using daily market data for the previous twelve months and report var at a confidence level 
var is a statistical technique used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical price trends and volatility 
this model assumes that historical changes in market conditions are representative of future changes  and trading losses on any given day could exceed the reported var by significant amounts in unusual volatile markets 
further  the model involves a number of assumptions and inputs 
while we believe that the assumptions and inputs we use in our risk model are reasonable  different assumptions and inputs could produce materially different var estimates 
the following table sets forth the high  low  and daily average var for our institutional fixed income trading portfolio during the year ended december  and the daily var at december  and in thousands  except rates year ended december  var calculation at high low daily average december  december  daily var related portfolio value var as a percentage of portfolio value stifel bank s interest rate risk is principally associated with changes in market interest rates related to residential  consumer  and commercial lending activities  as well as fdic insured deposit accounts to customers of our broker dealer subsidiaries and to the general public 
our primary emphasis in interest rate risk management for stifel bank is the matching of assets and liabilities of similar cash flow and repricing time frames 
this matching of assets and liabilities reduces exposure to interest rate movements and aids in stabilizing positive interest spreads 
stifel bank has established limits for acceptable interest rate risk and acceptable portfolio value risk 
to ensure that stifel bank is within the limits established for net interest margin  an analysis of net interest margin based on various shifts in interest rates is prepared each quarter and presented to stifel bank s board of directors 
stifel bank utilizes a third party vendor to analyze the available data 
the following table illustrates the estimated change in net interest margin at december  based on shifts in interest rates of up to positive basis points and negative basis points hypothetical change in interest rates projected change in net interest margin n a n a the following gap analysis table indicates stifel bank s interest rate sensitivity position at december  in thousands repricing opportunities months months years years interest earning assets loans securities interest bearing cash interest bearing liabilities transaction accounts and savings certificates of deposit borrowings gap cumulative gap we maintain a risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility 
our goal is to manage sensitivity to changes in rates by hedging the maturity characteristics of fed funds based affiliated deposits  thereby limiting the impact on earnings 
by using derivative instruments  we are exposed to credit and market risk on those derivative positions 
we manage the market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken 
our interest rate hedging strategies may not work in all market environments and as a result may not be effective in mitigating interest rate risk 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk as a consequence of making markets in equity securities 
we attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions constantly throughout each day 
our equity securities inventories are repriced on a regular basis  and there are no unrecorded gains or losses 
our activities as a dealer are client driven  with the objective of meeting clients needs while earning a positive spread 
credit risk we are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities  with the counterparties primarily being broker dealers 
in the event counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  we may be exposed to risk 
the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty or issuer of the instrument 
we manage this risk by imposing and monitoring position limits for each counterparty  monitoring trading counterparties  conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties  reviewing security concentrations  holding and marking to market collateral on certain transactions  and conducting business through clearing organizations  which guarantee performance 
our client activities involve the execution  settlement  and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients 
client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis 
credit exposure associated with our private client business consists primarily of customer margin accounts  which are monitored daily and are collateralized 
we monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform analyses on a regular basis in connection with our margin lending activities 
we adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
we have accepted collateral in connection with resale agreements  securities borrowed transactions  and customer margin loans 
under many agreements  we are permitted to sell or repledge these securities held as collateral and use these securities to enter into securities lending arrangements or to deliver to counterparties to cover short positions 
at december   the fair value of securities accepted as collateral where we are permitted to sell or repledge the securities was million  and the fair value of the collateral that had been sold or repledged was million 
by using derivative instruments  we are exposed to credit and market risk on those derivative positions 
credit risk is equal to the fair value gain in a derivative  if the counterparty fails to perform 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  this generally indicates that the counterparty owes our company and  therefore  creates a repayment risk for our company 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is negative  we owe the counterparty and  therefore  have no repayment risk 
we minimize the credit or repayment risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties that are reviewed periodically by senior management 
stifel bank extends credit to individual and commercial borrowers through a variety of loan products  including residential and commercial mortgage loans  home equity loans  construction loans and non real estate commercial and consumer loans 
bank loans are generally collateralized by real estate  real property  or other assets of the borrower 
stifel bank s loan policy includes criteria to adequately underwrite  document  monitor  and manage credit risk 
underwriting requires reviewing and documenting the fundamental characteristics of credit including character  capacity to service the debt  capital  conditions  and collateral 
benchmark capital and coverage ratios are utilized which include liquidity  debt service coverage  credit  working capital  and capital to asset ratios 
lending limits are established to include individual  collective  committee  and board authority 
monitoring credit risk is accomplished through defined loan review procedures including frequency and scope 
we are subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions  extend large loans to  or have large commitments with a single counterparty  borrower  or group of similar counterparties or borrowers ie  in the same industry 
securities purchased under agreements to resell consist of securities issued by the us government or its agencies 
receivables from and payables to clients and stock borrow and lending activities both with a large number of clients and counterparties  and any potential concentration is carefully monitored 
stock borrow and lending activities are executed under master netting agreements  which gives our company right of offset in the event of counterparty default 
inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made  including underwritings  may involve exposure to individual issuers and businesses 
we seek to limit this risk through careful review of counterparties and borrowers and the use of limits established by our senior management group  taking into consideration factors including the financial strength of the counterparty  the size of the position or commitment  the expected duration of the position or commitment  and other positions or commitments outstanding 
operational risk operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in our technology or financial operating systems  and inadequacies or breaches in our control processes 
we operate different businesses in diverse markets and are reliant on the ability of our employees and systems to process a large number of transactions 
these risks are less direct than credit and market risk  but managing them is critical  particularly in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volumes 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees  we could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions  and damage to our reputation 
in order to mitigate and control operational risk  we have developed and continue to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization and within such departments as accounting  operations  information technology  legal  compliance  and internal audit 
these control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that our various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits 
business continuity plans exist for critical systems  and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate 
regulatory and legal risk legal risk includes the risk of large numbers of private client group customer claims for sales practice violations 
while these claims may not be the result of any wrongdoing  we do  at a minimum  incur costs associated with investigating and defending against such claims 
see further discussion on our legal reserves policy under critical accounting policies and estimates in item  part ii and legal proceedings in item  part i of this report 
in addition  we are subject to potentially sizable adverse legal judgments or arbitration awards  and fines  penalties  and other sanctions for non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
we are generally subject to extensive regulation by the sec  finra  and state securities regulators in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
as a bank holding company  we are subject to regulation by the federal reserve 
stifel bank is subject to regulation by the fdic 
as a result  we are subject to a risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with banking laws 
we have comprehensive procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  the extension of credit  including margin loans  collection activities  money laundering  and record keeping 
we act as an underwriter or selling group member in both equity and fixed income product offerings 
particularly when acting as lead or co lead manager  we have potential legal exposure to claims relating to these securities offerings 
to manage this exposure  a committee of senior executives review proposed underwriting commitments to assess the quality of the offering and the adequacy of due diligence investigation 
effects of inflation our assets are primarily monetary  consisting of cash  securities inventory  and receivables from customers and brokers and dealers 
these monetary assets are generally liquid and turn over rapidly  and consequently  are not significantly affected by inflation 
however  the rate of inflation affects various expenses of our company  such as employee compensation and benefits  communications and office supplies  and occupancy and equipment rental  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services we offer to our clients 
further  to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations
