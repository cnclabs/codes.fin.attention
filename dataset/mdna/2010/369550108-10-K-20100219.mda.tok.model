management overview general dynamics offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation  combat vehicles  weapons systems and munitions  shipbuilding design  repair and construction  and information systems  technologies and services 
we operate through four business groups aerospace  combat systems  marine systems and information systems and technology 
our primary customers are the us military  other us government organizations  the armed forces of other nations  and a diverse base of corporate  government and individual buyers of business aircraft 
we operate in two primary markets defense and national security  and business aviation 
the majority of our revenues derive from contracts with the us military 
logo the nation s engagement in combating terrorism around the world  coupled with the need to grow and modernize us military forces  has driven department of defense funding levels since in particular  procurement and research and development r d budgets  also known as investment accounts  provide the majority of our revenues 
for fiscal year  the congress appropriated billion for the department of defense  including approximately billion for procurement and r d 
budget expenditures generally lag congressional funding  and we expect that expenditures applied toward programs over the next few years will be consistent with defense funding appropriated in recent years 
to fund the wars in afghanistan and iraq  defense budgets have also included supplemental funding 
while some of our programs have received supplemental funds  most of our funding is now derived from base budgets 
for fiscal year  the congress has appropriated approximately billion in supplemental funding  including approximately percent for investment accounts 
the defense department has requested another billion of supplemental funding in if this second supplemental is approved  defense funding for fiscal year will total approximately billion 
for fiscal year  the president has requested total defense funding of billion  including billion in supplemental funding 
the budget requests billion for investment accounts  an increase of percent over the fiscal year appropriation  including a nearly percent increase in procurement funding 
in february  the department of defense published the quadrennial defense review qdr  an analysis of military priorities that shapes defense funding over the ensuing four years 
this review reiterated the need for the military to prepare for a broad range of security challenges  and it prioritized continued investment in warfighting capabilities served by our portfolio of defense programs 
the pentagon s five year spending plan  also submitted to the congress in february  reflects the slow  steady growth requirements set forth in the qdr 
through  the base defense budget is expected to grow at a low single digit rate 
investment accounts are also projected to display low single digit inflation adjusted growth  with procurement funding for mature programs growing and r d funding for new programs declining over the period 
this five year plan also forecasts a reduction in future supplemental funding levels consistent with the administration s plan to reduce troop levels in iraq  offset somewhat by an increased footprint in afghanistan 
our future growth in the us defense market is driven by the size and allocation of the defense budget  the diversity of our exposure to different programs and customers within the budget  our ability to evolve our products to address a fast changing threat environment  and our successful execution of the contracts we are awarded 
while the landscape will continue to evolve in conjunction with dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions  we expect defense funding to continue to be driven by the following support for the warfighter from the administration and the congress in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment  the number of troops deployed in afghanistan and iraq  coupled with the increase in the overall size of the us military  the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed in iraq and afghanistan since  the need to maintain thousands of jobs that support the health of our nation s military infrastructure  and the need to modernize that infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern day warfare 
beyond the us defense market  governments around the world continue to fund weapons and equipment modernization programs  leading to significant defense export opportunities 
we are committed to pursuing opportunities presented by international demand for military hardware and information technologies 
while the revenue potential can be significant  international defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing  changing priorities and overall spending pressures 
as we broaden the customer base for our defense products around the world  we expect our international sales and exports to grow 
the deterioration in the global economic environment in late and early significantly impacted the business aviation market 
difficult economic conditions  tight credit markets and negative business jet rhetoric general dynamics annual report 
table of contents in the first half of caused new aircraft orders to decline  customers to default on aircraft contracts and pre owned aircraft inventories to grow 
business jet market conditions began to improve in the second half of  in line with the broader financial market recovery 
improved flying hours  increased new aircraft order interest  particularly for large cabin aircraft  abating customer defaults and higher aircraft service activity helped to stabilize our aerospace business 
barring any further economic turmoil  we believe the diversity and duration of our business jet order book positions the aerospace group for further improvement in continued investment in new aircraft products is expected to drive the aerospace group s long term growth  particularly when it begins delivering its newest aircraft offerings  the g scheduled to enter service in and the g scheduled to enter service in 
similarly  we believe that aircraft service revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by continued growth in the global installed business jet fleet 
we are committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices  disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements 
our solid performance is measured in our sustained revenue and earnings growth and strong cash flow 
general dynamics record as an industry leader in cash flow generation has provided us the flexibility to execute our operational strategy and enabled us consistently to deploy resources to further enhance shareholder returns through acquisitions  payment of dividends and share repurchases 
consolidated overview the following discussion of our results of operations is based on operating performance at the business group level 
the disclosures focus on the material financial measures we use to evaluate the performance of each of our four business groups  including revenues  operating earnings and margins  cash flow  and orders and backlog 
for the defense business groups  the discussion of results of operations is based on specific contracts and programs that drive the group s results rather than types of products and services  which often comprise multiple contracts with different customers 
for the aerospace group  the results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services  consistent with how the group is managed 
in the defense business groups  the majority of the revenues are generated by long term government contracts 
as discussed further in the application of critical accounting policies section  we account for revenues under these contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method  revenue is recognized as work progresses  either as products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered 
as a result  changes in revenues are generally discussed in terms of volume 
volume indicates increases or decreases in revenues due to changes in production or construction activity levels  delivery schedules or levels of services on individual contracts 
in the aerospace group  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method 
sales contracts for new aircraft have two major phases the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft s completion  which includes exterior painting and installation of customer selected interiors and optional avionics 
we record revenues on these contracts at two milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer  and when the customer accepts final delivery of the aircraft 
revenues in the aerospace group s aircraft outfitting and services businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of the service  similar to our defense businesses 
changes in revenues in this group result from the number of new aircraft deliveries both green and completion  the progress toward completion of aircraft outfitting activities  the level of service activity during the period and the number of pre owned aircraft sold 
operating earnings and margins in the defense business groups are discussed in terms of changes in revenue volume  performance  the mix of contracts eg  fixed price cost reimbursable and the phases of work within those contracts eg  development production 
performance refers to changes in contract earnings rates during the term of the contract based on revisions to estimates of profit at completion on individual contracts 
these revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract and or the estimated costs required to complete the contract 
the following discussion of results provides additional disclosure to the extent that a material or unusual event causes a change in the profitability of a contract 
in general  operating earnings and margins in the aerospace group are a function of the prices we charge for our aircraft  our operational efficiency in manufacturing and completing the aircraft  and the mix of aircraft deliveries among the higher margin large cabin and lower margin mid size aircraft 
additional factors affecting the group s earnings and margins include the volume and profitability of services work performed  the number and type of pre owned aircraft sold  and the level of general and administrative costs incurred by the group  which include selling expenses and research and development costs

table of contents logo review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin general dynamics revenues increased significantly in compared with  as strong performance in each of our defense businesses more than offset the decline in the business jet market 
the combat systems group generated the strongest revenue growth from higher volume in its us and european military vehicle programs and the acquisition of axletech international in december the marine systems group s revenues were up significantly because of increased activity on us navy and commercial shipbuilding and repair programs across our shipyards 
in the information systems and technology group  increased volume in each of the group s us operations and recent acquisitions drove the group s revenue growth 
revenues decreased in the aerospace group in following our decision to cut aircraft production and deliveries principally mid size aircraft in response to a significant downturn in the business jet market in the first half of the year 
this decline was offset partially by the acquisition of jet aviation in november our operating earnings increased slightly in over earnings growth in each of our defense businesses was mostly offset by reduced earnings in aerospace 
operating margins were up significantly in the marine systems group because of improved operating performance at each of our shipyards during the year 
in the information systems and technology group  margins remained consistent with those achieved in a shift in contract mix in the combat systems group led to reduced margins compared with the prior year 
the aerospace group s margins were reduced by a five week furlough at the group s aircraft assembly operations in the third quarter of  losses associated with pre owned aircraft activities and the addition of lower margin business at jet aviation 
as a result  our overall operating margins decreased by basis points in compared with review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin we generated solid revenue growth in compared with  and operating earnings increased at more than twice the rate of revenue growth 
the aerospace and marine systems groups achieved the most significant jump in revenues as a result of increases in business jet deliveries and higher activity on shipbuilding programs 
revenues increased in the combat systems group due to strong demand for us military vehicles and related support services 
higher activity in tactical and strategic mission systems contributed the majority of the revenue growth in the information systems and technology group 
our operating earnings increased significantly in  and three of our four business groups reported earnings in excess of billion 
growth in operating earnings exceeded the revenue growth in each of our business groups due to strong program execution and a continued focus on operating performance 
overall  our operating margins increased basis points to percent in cash flow cash flows from operations in exceeded net earnings for the th consecutive year 
net cash provided by operating activities was billion in  billion in and billion in over the three year period  we deployed our cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures  repurchase our common stock  pay dividends and repay maturing debt 
our net debt debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities was billion at year end compared with billion at the end of this billion decrease in net debt was achieved after the following capital deployments spent on acquisitions  of dividends paid  of company sponsored research and development  of capital expenditures  approximately of contributions to our retirement plans and of share repurchases during the year

net interest expense increased to in compared with in and in due to the issuance of additional debt in and and lower interest income  reflecting lower market interest rates and a reduced invested cash balance during the year 
we expect net interest expense of approximately in  subject to capital deployment activities during the year 
our effective tax rate was percent in  percent in and percent in the rate included a  or approximately per share  benefit from the settlement of tax refund litigation  which reduced the tax rate by basis points 
our effective tax rate in was impacted favorably by the resolution of our to federal income tax audit with the internal revenue service 
this settlement resulted in a benefit of  or approximately per share  which reduced our effective tax rate by basis points 
we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately to percent in for additional discussion of tax matters  see note e to the consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations in  we entered into an agreement to sell our spanish nitrocellulose operation and recognized a pretax loss of in discontinued operations in anticipation of the sale 
we are awaiting spanish government approval and expect the sale to close in in  we completed the sale of our coal mining operation and received proceeds of approximately our reported revenues exclude the revenues associated with these divested businesses 
we have presented their operating results  along with the gains and losses from the transactions discussed above  as discontinued operations  net of income taxes 
backlog and estimated potential contract value logo our total backlog was billion at the end of compared to billion at year end funded backlog was billion at year end  down from billion at the end of we received billion of new orders in the information systems and technology group s orders were particularly strong in  resulting in a book to bill ratio orders divided by revenues greater than one to one for the second consecutive year 
combat systems also had another strong order year  driven in part by growing international order activity late in the year 
the total backlog for our defense businesses decreased in to billion at the end of the year  compared with billion at the end of the defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts 
about three quarters of the decline in our defense backlog during was in marine systems  which traditionally receives large  multi year awards and works down that backlog in subsequent periods 
the funded portion of the defense backlog was billion at the end of  down from billion in december this includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer  as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments 
while there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program  we have included in the backlog only firm contracts we believe are likely to receive funding 
the aerospace group s total backlog was billion at the end of following a record level of billion at year end aerospace funded backlog was billion at the end of compared to billion at the end of aerospace funded backlog represents orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer 
the aerospace unfunded backlog of at the end of consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services 
our backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq contracts  unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft  which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value 
customers use idiq contracts when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed 
these agreements  which set forth the majority of the contractual terms  including prices  are funded as delivery orders are placed 
a significant portion of our estimated potential contract value includes our estimate of the value we will receive under multiple award idiq contracts in which we are one of several companies competing for task orders 
the estimated contract value also includes idiq contracts for which we have been designated as the sole source supplier to design  develop  produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies 
we believe the customers intend to fully implement these systems 
because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders  we recognize these contracts in backlog only when they are funded 
general dynamics annual report 
table of contents contract options in our defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts  if the customer exercises the option 
these options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date 
contract options in the aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft and long term agreements with fleet customers 
we recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order 
on december   the estimated potential value associated with these idiq contracts and contract options was approximately billion  up from billion at the end of this represents our estimate of the potential value we will receive 
the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower 
we expect to realize this value over the next to years 
review of operating segments aerospace review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin gulfstream aircraft deliveries in units green completion the aerospace group s revenues decreased in  the net result of a percent decline in gulfstream revenues that was offset in part by revenues from jet aviation  which we acquired in the fourth quarter of the combination of the global economic deterioration and credit crisis along with negative business jet rhetoric had a significant impact on the business jet market in to adjust to the economic conditions and weakened demand  we reduced gulfstream s aircraft production and delivery schedule  primarily in the group s mid size models  to bridge the market downturn 
this included a five week furlough at the group s production center in savannah  georgia  in july and august 
as a result  aircraft manufacturing revenues decreased percent in compared with the economic environment also impacted the group s aircraft services business 
organic aircraft services revenues were down percent in resulting from reduced flying hours and customer deferral of aircraft maintenance 
the decline in aircraft manufacturing and services revenues was slightly offset by higher pre owned aircraft revenues in the group sold six pre owned aircraft for in compared with two sales for in the group s operating earnings declined in compared with due primarily to the factors noted above 
the components of the reduction in earnings were as follows aircraft manufacturing and completions pre owned aircraft aircraft services other total decrease in operating earnings the net decrease in the group s aircraft manufacturing and completions earnings in resulted from the reduction in gulfstream aircraft deliveries offset in part by the addition of jet aviation s aircraft completions and refurbishing business 
the earnings decline associated with the decreased gulfstream volume was mitigated by cost reduction initiatives  a shift in the mix of aircraft deliveries toward large cabin aircraft  and liquidated damages collected on defaulted aircraft contracts 
as a result  aircraft manufacturing margins increased in over despite the decline in volume during the year 
the group continues to focus on reducing costs through production improvements and operational efficiencies to maintain aircraft manufacturing margins 
in late and early  the supply in the global pre owned aircraft market increased significantly  putting considerable pressure on pricing 
as a result  the group wrote down the carrying value of its pre owned aircraft inventory in pricing in the pre owned market appears to have stabilized in the second half of  particularly for large cabin aircraft 
the group continues to work to minimize its pre owned aircraft exposure  with four pre owned aircraft valued at remaining in inventory at the end of aircraft services earnings were steady in compared with as the addition of jet aviation s maintenance and repair activities  fixed base operations and aircraft management services offset a decrease in organic aircraft services earnings 
a significant reduction in flight hours in the business jet market put competitive pressure on aircraft maintenance and repair earnings in the group s operating earnings also were impacted negatively in by severance costs associated with workforce reduction activities and intangible asset amortization related to the jet aviation acquisition 
the factors discussed above and the addition of lower margin jet aviation business caused the group s overall operating margins to decrease basis points in compared with general dynamics annual report 
table of contents review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin gulfstream aircraft deliveries in units green completion the aerospace group generated significant revenue growth in  attributable primarily to increased aircraft deliveries compared with new aircraft revenues were up percent in as a result of the increased aircraft production 
aircraft services volume increased percent over the acquisition of jet aviation in november contributed approximately one quarter of the group s increase in revenues 
the group s pre owned aircraft revenues were in  down from in the aerospace group s operating earnings increased at a significantly higher rate than revenues in approximately of the earnings growth resulted from higher new aircraft and aircraft services volume 
improved pricing  a favorable delivery mix and productivity improvements in the aircraft assembly and outfitting processes increased earnings by approximately reduced sales of pre owned aircraft and write downs of pre owned aircraft inventory reduced the group s earnings growth by increased selling expenses from strong order activity and higher product development costs associated with the introduction of two new aircraft models in also reduced the group s earnings growth by backlog and estimated potential contract value logo the economic turmoil of late and early had a significant impact on the business jet market 
the collapse of the global economy led some customers in the backlog to default on their contracts and caused some prospective customers to delay aircraft orders 
both the large cabin and mid size segments experienced a decline in orders in late and early however  the mid size market experienced the greatest impact 
large cabin orders improved steadily throughout the year 
excluding the introduction of the new g  large cabin orders in the fourth quarter of reached their highest level since the second quarter of despite the rebound in order activity resulting in a full year book to bill ratio orders divided by revenues greater than one to one  the customer defaults led to a percent decline in the group s backlog from the end of the aerospace group ended with billion of backlog  of which billion was funded 
scheduled large cabin deliveries are sold out through and well into conditions in the mid size market remain challenging 
however  these aircraft represent a declining proportion of our portfolio 
we continually assess aircraft production requirements and will modify the group s production and delivery schedule as necessary based on the state of the backlog and the business jet market 
over the past few years  the group s customer base has become increasingly diverse  both in customer type and geographic region 
the group s year end backlog is divided approximately evenly among public companies  private companies and individual buyers 
no one customer represents more than percent of the group s backlog 
in addition  the backlog has shifted toward the international market  with customers outside north america comprising almost percent of the backlog 
the aerospace backlog has also been diversified to include orders for the group s newest aircraft models the g and the g both of these aircraft were introduced in and achieved their scheduled first flight in the fourth quarter of initial green deliveries for each are scheduled to begin in the backlog does not include options to purchase new aircraft or long term agreements with fleet customers 
these arrangements totaled billion at the end of and are included in estimated potential contract value 
outlook we expect a low to mid single digit percentage increase in the aerospace group s revenues in compared with we expect to deliver approximately the same number of aircraft  with a further shift toward the large cabin models 
we also anticipate a modest increase in aircraft services activity in based on the favorable mix of aircraft deliveries and the stabilization of the pre owned aircraft market  tempered by the pace of ongoing operational improvement efforts at jet aviation  we expect the aerospace group s margins to improve slightly over to approximately percent 
these expectations do not assume any recovery in the mid size market in general dynamics annual report 
table of contents combat systems review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin the combat systems group s revenues increased significantly in compared with the increase in revenues was driven by percent organic growth and the acquisition of axletech international in december the group received strong contributions to this growth from each of its markets us military vehicles weapons systems and munitions european military vehicles total increase in revenues increased volume on the stryker wheeled combat vehicle and abrams main battle tank programs generated over half of the group s revenue growth in the higher stryker activity was due to increased vehicle production and modernization work 
under the abrams program  the group continued to upgrade ma tanks to the ma system enhancement package sep configuration for the us army and produced more abrams tank kits for egypt 
the revenue growth in the us military vehicles business was tempered somewhat by lower volume on the group s mine resistant  ambush protected mrap vehicle deliveries  which were completed in the second quarter of organic revenues were up in the group s weapons systems and munitions businesses due to increased production of armor kits for stryker vehicles  an increase in deliveries of hydra rockets and higher volume on munitions supply contracts for the united states and canada 
the group s european military vehicle business generated strong revenue growth in revenues increased as a result of higher activity on several wheeled armored vehicle production programs  including the piranha for belgium and spain and the eagle for germany 
volume also increased on the group s european arms and munitions and mobile bridge programs  while activity was down on the leopard tank program with the spanish government 
the combat systems group s operating earnings grew in  though at a lower rate than revenues  resulting in a basis point decrease in operating margins compared with the group s margins in were unusually high because of a favorable program mix in the us military vehicles business 
review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin in  the combat systems group s revenues were up compared with due to strength in the group s us military vehicles business 
the majority of the revenue growth was generated by higher activity on the mrap vehicle program  which emerged in late  and several contracts in support of the group s abrams main battle tank modernization efforts  including the sep upgrade and repair and reset work for battle damaged m tanks 
revenues in the group s weapons systems business decreased in due to fewer deliveries of systems that help protect us combat forces from improvised explosive devices ieds 
revenues increased slightly on the group s munitions programs over in the group s european military vehicles business  volume was lower during the year on several international military vehicle programs  including the leopard tank program 
the group s operating earnings grew significantly in  increasing at more than four times the rate of revenue growth during the year 
while the most significant driver of the group s earnings growth was improved performance in the us military vehicle business  particularly on the mrap and abrams programs  each of the group s businesses generated at least a basis point increase in margins in the operating leverage achieved across combat systems operations in produced an overall basis point improvement in the group s operating margins compared with backlog and estimated potential contract value logo the combat systems group s total backlog was billion at the end of  down percent from billion at year end funded backlog decreased percent in to billion at year end 
approximately  or percent  of the year over year decline in the group s backlog is attributable to the army s termination for convenience of the manned ground vehicle portion of the future combat systems fcs program

the group received billion of new orders in the group s backlog consists primarily of long term production contracts that have scheduled deliveries through the group s backlog at the end of included approximately billion for m abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs 
these include the ma sep  system technical support sts and tank urban survivability kit tusk programs 
under the sep program  we retrofit abrams main battle tanks with improved electronics  command and control capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tank s effectiveness 
the group continued work in on a multi year contract awarded in to upgrade the remaining ma abrams tanks to the sep configuration 
approximately percent of the group s abrams backlog at year end was for the sep program 
under the sts program  we identify improvements and replace obsolete parts on abrams tanks to maintain the tanks at high operational readiness rates 
tusk is a technological upgrade that improves the effectiveness of the tank in urban warfare environments 
at year end  the abrams backlog included a combined for the sts and tusk programs 
in  the group received awards from the army totaling for all abrams related programs  including awards to build ma situational awareness sa tanks for the iraqi army and for ma upgrades for saudi arabia 
the army s stryker wheeled combat vehicle program comprised over billion of the group s backlog at year end  including the production of approximately vehicles scheduled for delivery through the group received over billion of stryker orders in  including awards worth approximately for vehicle production  for contractor logistics support and for stryker modernization 
in january  the army awarded the group a contract worth an additional for battle damage assessment  repair services and materials for stryker brigades deployed to iraq and afghanistan 
in february  the army awarded the group an additional to continue stryker logistics support and requested funds to establish an additional stryker brigade combat team 
almost of the group s backlog at the end of was for the us marine corps expeditionary fighting vehicle efv program 
the group is building seven new prototypes under the system design and development phase of the efv program  which the group expects to deliver in the combat systems group has several significant international military vehicle production contracts in backlog 
the backlog at the end of the year included billion for light armored vehicles under a foreign military sale fms contract through the army  for the production of pizarro advanced infantry fighting vehicles scheduled for delivery to the spanish army through  for pandur vehicles for an international customer  for the production of pandur ii vehicles for the czech republic  from the swiss government to provide duro wheeled armored personnel vehicles  for a contract with the government of belgium for piranha wheeled military vehicles and for the production of leopard e battle tanks  which the group produces for the spanish army using a design licensed from a german company

in  the group received awards totaling for the production of hydra rockets  bringing the total contract value to date to over billion 
the group also received awards worth approximately from the canadian government to supply various calibers of training and tactical ammunition and from the army for production of mhb machine guns 
outlook we expect to percent revenue growth in combat systems in attributable largely to international vehicle contracts and to growing activity in us armament and munitions programs 
we anticipate a slight decline in the group s operating margins to the high percent range due to a shift in program mix  including the start up of several new contracts 
marine systems review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin each of the marine systems group s shipyards contributed to the group s strong growth in revenues and operating earnings in over the prior year 
the increase in revenues consisted of the following multi year navy ship construction other navy ship design  construction  engineering and repair commercial ship construction total increase in revenues the group s multi year ship construction programs for the us navy include virginia class submarines  t ake combat logistics ships and general dynamics annual report 
table of contents ddg and ddg destroyers 
the virginia class program contributed almost two thirds of the group s increase in revenues 
the group delivered the sixth boat under the program in and continued construction on the next five of the remaining boats under contract 
virginia activity is expected to continue to ramp up as the group moves toward construction of two ships per year starting in with deliveries scheduled through activity was down slightly on the t ake program in as the group continued construction on the ninth through th ships 
the group delivered the seventh and eighth ships in  and deliveries of the remaining four ships awarded to date are scheduled through with ships and in on the destroyer programs  revenues were up in as activity increased significantly on the group s design and production contracts for the ddg next generation destroyer  while volume on the ddg arleigh burke class program decreased  consistent with our expectations 
the first ddg delivery is scheduled in  and the remaining three ddg destroyers under contract are scheduled for delivery through in addition to these ship construction programs  volume was up significantly in on engineering and repair programs for the navy 
the growing service requirements of the navy s aging fleet  along with the rebalancing of the fleet to position more ships on the west coast  generated significant additional repair volume for our west coast operations 
the group s commercial shipbuilding activity consists of a five ship product carrier program 
activity on this program increased slightly in as the first three ships were delivered and construction continued on the remaining two ships  which are scheduled for delivery in the marine systems group s operating earnings increased significantly in each of the group s shipyards has focused on operational efficiency and achieved significant labor and material cost reductions during the year 
these efforts resulted in higher earnings rates on several key programs in  including the virginia class  ddg  ddg and commercial product carrier programs 
as a result  the group s operating margins increased basis points over to percent 
the group s significant improvement in followed a basis point increase in margins in over review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin revenues in the marine systems group were up in as a result of increased activity at each of the group s shipyards 
activity increased on the virginia class program as the group delivered the fourth and fifth boats in the program in volume also increased on the t ake and ddg programs 
commercial shipbuilding volume was up in as the group ramped up construction of the first three of its product carrier ships 
slightly lower activity on the ddg destroyer program and the completion of the group s ssgn submarine conversion contract in the fourth quarter of slightly offset the other volume increases in the group in the marine systems group improved its performance significantly in  increasing operating earnings at double the rate of revenue growth 
as a result of operational efficiencies realized at each of its shipyards  the group increased program earnings rates in on the virginia  ddg  t ake and commercial product carrier programs 
these improvements increased the group s overall margins by basis points in backlog and estimated potential contract value logo the marine systems group s backlog consists of long term submarine and ship construction programs  as well as numerous repair and engineering contracts 
the group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years 
for example  in the group received a billion contract for the construction of eight virginia class submarines to be delivered through after reaching an all time high of billion at the end of  the group s backlog decreased to billion at year end  consistent with this historical pattern 
the group s funded backlog at the end of was billion  down from billion at year end the current backlog includes shipbuilding deliveries through the virginia class submarine program was our largest single program in and is the largest contract in the group s backlog 
the group s backlog at year end included billion for virginia class submarines 
as the prime contractor on the virginia class program  we report the entire backlog and revenues associated with the program but share the construction activity and the earnings equally with our teaming partner 
the current navy plan calls for construction of one submarine in and two per year beginning in navy destroyer programs represent another significant component of the group s backlog 
these include the arleigh burke class ddg and zumwalt class ddg destroyer programs 
the group s backlog at the end of included billion for the ongoing design effort and construction of the first ddg in  the group received approximately in orders under the ddg program  general dynamics annual report 
table of contents including approximately for class common equipment cce material to begin construction of the first ship 
at year end  the backlog included approximately for the remaining three ddg destroyers under contract 
we anticipate receiving funding for long lead materials for an additional ddg in the group is currently negotiating contracts with the navy for the construction of two additional ddg s 
we expect these awards to provide stability to the group s destroyer production for the foreseeable future 
the marine systems group s backlog at year end also included for four of the remaining six ships under the navy s t ake combat logistics ship program  including of long lead materials for the last two ships 
these two ships have been authorized and appropriated by the congress  and we expect to receive construction contracts in the year end backlog included for the navy s littoral combat ship lcs program 
in  the group delivered its first lcs and received an order worth approximately from the navy for the second ship  scheduled for delivery in at the end of  the group s backlog included approximately for the remaining effort on the group s product carrier contract 
in addition  the marine systems group s backlog at year end included approximately billion for engineering  repair  overhaul and other services 
in january  the navy awarded the group an additional to continue a development contract for concept studies  engineering and design of a common missile compartment for the next generation ballistic missile submarines under development for the navy and the royal navy of the united kingdom 
outlook we expect to percent revenue growth in marine systems in as activity continues to ramp up on the virginia class and ddg construction programs  as well as submarine engineering activities 
the group s operating margins should moderate somewhat to the mid percent range due to a shift in contract mix from more mature programs to earlier stage construction  particularly among the group s destroyer programs

the overall increase in revenues in was well distributed across the group s businesses information technology and mission services tactical and strategic mission systems intelligence mission systems total increase in revenues in the group s it services business  approximately percent of the revenue growth in was organic and resulted primarily from higher volume on several it infrastructure and support programs  including the new campus east nce contract for the national geospatial intelligence agency  the network centric solutions netcents program for us federal agencies and the technology operations and maintenance infrastructure support tomis contract for the us bureau of citizenship and immigration 
the revenue growth on these programs was partially offset by lower activity in the commercial wireless market 
the most notable performance drivers in the group s tactical and strategic mission systems business were higher volume on the warfighter information network tactical win t program and ground based satellite communications programs  as well as increased sales of encryption products 
volume in the group s united kingdom based tactical communications operations was steady compared with the intelligence systems business had the highest revenue growth rate in  the result of organic growth in each of its business areas and the acquisition of axsys technologies  inc  in september approximately percent of the revenue growth in this business was organic 
higher activity on cyber security and several classified programs  as well as increased volume on a contract to build the spacecraft for nasa s landsat data continuity mission  contributed the majority of this growth 
the information systems and technology group s operating earnings increased in line with revenues in as a result  the group achieved operating margins of percent  consistent with margins increased in the tactical systems and intelligence systems businesses due to improved performance and a favorable shift in contract mix  but margins were down in the it services business as a result of contract mix

revenues were up in the group s core it services business due primarily to the ramp up of activity on several new programs  including the tomis contract and the warfighter field operations customer support focus army training contract 
within the it services business  the group s commercial wireless operations experienced significantly lower activity in due to reduced demand in the market 
revenues in the group s intelligence mission systems business remained steady compared with revenues decreased in the group s uk business due to a scheduled decline in activity on the bowman communications program for the uk armed forces  offset in part by higher activity on other command  control  communications  computing and intelligence systems ci programs

outlook we expect revenues in the information systems and technology group to grow by to percent in we expect each of the group s businesses to contribute to the growth  particularly in the areas of it support for intelligence and federal civilian customers  and intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance work  including cyber security 
the group s operating margins should decline slightly but remain in the mid percent range based on the projected contract mix in corporate corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options and a portion of the results from our commercial pension plans

termination of a program 
as discussed further in note n to the consolidated financial statements  litigation on the a program termination has been ongoing since if  contrary to our expectations  the default termination ultimately is sustained and the government prevails on its recovery theories  we  along with the boeing company  could collectively be required to repay the us government as much as billion for progress payments received for the a contract  plus interest  which was approximately billion at december  if this were the outcome  we would owe half of the total  or approximately billion pretax 
our after tax cash obligation would be approximately we believe we have sufficient resources  including access to capital markets  to pay such an obligation  if required 
investing activities we used billion in  billion in and in for investing activities 
the primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures 
business acquisitions

see note b to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were in  in and in the decrease in compared with resulted from the completion of several major facility improvement projects in the aerospace and marine systems groups 
we expect capital expenditures of approximately in  less than percent of revenues 
we had no material commitments for capital expenditures on december  marketable securities

we emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns 
in  for the th consecutive year  net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net earnings 
we deployed this cash to complete acquisitions  continue our trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase our outstanding shares 
as a result of this continued focus on cash generation and disciplined capital deployment  our return on invested capital roic has grown basis points since we believe roic is a useful measure for investors  because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations 
we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management 
we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders equity for the year 
net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after tax interest and amortization expense 
roic in and was impacted by the reduction and increase  respectively  in our shareholders equity associated with the returns on our retirement plan assets

our free cash flow from operations was billion in  billion in  billion in and billion in each of and we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 
we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors  because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt  funding business acquisitions  repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends

application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to long term contracts and programs  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  workers compensation  warranty obligations  pre owned aircraft inventory  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application revenue recognition 
we account for revenues and earnings in our defense and aerospace businesses using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize contract revenue as the work progresses either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered  as applicable 
we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input measures eg  costs incurred or output measures eg  contract milestones or units delivered  as appropriate to the circumstances 
where an interim output measure is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion  we use such output measures 
otherwise  we use input measures 
we generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion or based on unit deliveries under the contract 
our contracts for the manufacture of business jet aircraft usually provide for two major phases the manufacture of the green aircraft ie  before exterior painting and installation of customer selected interiors and optional avionics and its completion 
we record revenue at two contractual milestones when green aircraft are delivered general dynamics annual report 
table of contents to  and accepted by  the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 
we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless a contract has been executed with the customer and the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer and other factors 
we include revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the reallocation method rather than the cumulative catch up method 
under the reallocation method  the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term  while under the cumulative catch up method such impact would be recognized immediately 
if a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract  we recognize the loss in the period it is identified 
anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts  including g a expenses on government contracts 
we use the reallocation method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates of total contract revenue  total costs or the extent of progress toward completion on our long term contracts affect both the period in which the change is identified and future periods 
we believe these changes generally reflect expectations as to future performance and  therefore  the reallocation method is the method that best matches our revenues and earnings in the periods in which they are earned 
while we have applied this method consistently for more than years  most contractors use the cumulative catch up method 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion  and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications or other disputes 
contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years  including future labor productivity and availability  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the cost and availability of materials  the impact of delayed performance  the availability and timing of funding from the customer  and the timing of product deliveries 
these estimates are based on our best judgment 
a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts 
we review our contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflect changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method 
we recognize revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable 
in evaluating these criteria  we consider the contractual legal basis for the claim  the cause of any additional costs incurred  the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim 
we recognize revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee 
estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance 
goodwill 
since  we have acquired businesses at a total cost of approximately billion  including two in in connection with these acquisitions  we have recognized billion of goodwill 
goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process that requires a significant level of estimation by management  particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units 
these estimates require the use of judgment 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations 
this requires numerous assumptions  including the timing of work embedded in our backlog  our performance and profitability under our contracts  our success in securing future business  and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows 
this discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by top down analyses  including a market assessment of our enterprise value 
beyond the annual impairment test  we review for factors on a quarterly basis that may lead us to perform a goodwill impairment test  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit 
we have recorded no goodwill impairment to date and do not anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to an impairment in the foreseeable future 
the fair value of each of our reporting units on december   substantially exceeded its carrying value 
commitments and contingencies 
we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment 
we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable 
the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 
deferred contract costs 
certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not currently allocable to contracts 
such costs include a portion of our estimated workers compensation obligations  other insurance related assessments  pension and other post retirement benefits  and environmental expenses 
these costs will become allocable to contracts generally when they are paid 
we have elected to defer or inventory these costs in contracts in process until they are paid  at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government 
we expect to recover these costs through ongoing business  including existing backlog and probable follow on contracts 
this business base includes numerous contracts for which we are the sole source or one of two suppliers on long term defense programs 
we regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable follow on contracts 
this assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs  the extent of cost recovery under general dynamics annual report 
table of contents our contracts and the amount of future contract activity 
these estimates are based on our best judgment 
if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs  the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected 
retirement plans 
our defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates 
the key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long term rates of return on plan assets 
we determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high quality fixed income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period 
we determine the long term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy 
these estimates are based on our best judgment  including consideration of current and future market conditions 
in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted  future pension and post retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease 
for the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets for our commercial pension and post retirement benefit plans  see note p to the consolidated financial statements 
as discussed under deferred contract costs  our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of contributions to our government retirement plans 
we have elected to defer recognition of the cumulative net unfunded benefit cost in our government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses 
accordingly  the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our future earnings either positively or negatively 
we believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily from foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices and investments 
see note m to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item  of this annual report on form k for a discussion of these risks 
the following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency risk we had billion in notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding on december   and billion on december  a percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following incremental pretax gains and losses gain loss recognized unrecognized this exchange rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the us dollar canadian dollar  euro swiss franc and us dollar swiss franc exchange rates 
we believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding losses and gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
we believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments  when taken together  do not create material market risk 
interest rate risk our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed rate long term debt obligations and variable rate commercial paper 
on december   we had billion par value of fixed rate debt 
we had no commercial paper outstanding 
our fixed rate debt obligations are not putable  and we do not trade these securities in the market 
a percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations 
investment risk our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed income securities with an investment grade rating and a maximum maturity of one year 
on december   we held billion in cash and equivalents and marketable securities to be used for general corporate purposes 
our marketable securities have an average duration of six months and an average credit rating of aa 
given that our investments had an aggregate weighted average maturity of days on december   a percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings 
historically  we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates or market values
