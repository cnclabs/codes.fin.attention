item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we are primarily a provider of primary care physician services 
through our network of medical centers  we provide primary care medical services on an outpatient basis 
we also provide practice management services to ipas 
all of our medical centers and ipas are located in miami dade  broward and hillsborough counties  florida 
as of june   we provided services to or for approximately  patients on a risk basis and approximately  patients on a limited or non risk basis 
additionally  we also provided services to over  patients as of june  on a non risk fee for service basis 
in fiscal  approximately and of our revenue was generated by providing services to medicare eligible and medicaid eligible members  respectively  under risk agreements that require us to assume responsibility to provide and pay for all of our patients medical needs in exchange for a capitated fee  typically a percentage of the premium received by an hmo from various payor sources 
in fiscal  we acquired two operators of sleep diagnostic centers for an aggregate total purchase price of million 
through seredor corporation  a subsidiary established to conduct sleep service activities  we operate and manage sleep diagnostic centers in florida  south carolina  north carolina  west virginia  virginia  colorado and ohio 
the centers conduct sleep studies to determine whether patients suffer from sleep disorders and  if so  the severity of the condition 
the clinical staff at the centers are expertly trained in sleep disorders and work with physicians  neurologists  respiratory therapists  and clinicians utilizing state of the art equipment to effectively diagnose and treat patients 
medicare and medicaid considerations substantially all of our revenue is generated by providing services to medicare eligible patients and medicaid eligible patients 
the federal government has enacted significant reforms to the us health care system which will have an impact on future revenues that we generate from our medicare and medicaid patients 
in march  the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act  and the health care and education reconciliation act of the provisions of these new laws include  among other things  limitations on medicare advantage payment rates and medicaid coverage expansion to individuals with incomes under of the poverty level beginning in because there is considerable uncertainty regarding the financial impact of these reforms  we cannot currently predict the effect such reforms will have on our business 
however  the lowering of future medicare advantage payment rates as well as other provisions of these new laws may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
cms recently announced that it will reduce medicare advantage premiums effective january based on information received from our hmo affiliates and cms  we believe that the capitation payments we receive under our percentage of premium arrangements with our hmo affiliates for our medicare advantage patients will decrease by approximately effective january  without taking into account any adjustments resulting from changes in medicare risk adjustment scores 
presently  we do not know whether our hmo affiliates will take any action to mitigate the effect of the medicare advantage premium reduction  such as reducing plan benefits that will become effective january  we will  however  seek to improve medical claims expense management and pursue other cost reduction strategies in an effort to mitigate the effects of the medicare advantage premium reduction 
there is no assurance that our medicare capitation payments will decrease by this amount or that our cost reduction strategies will mitigate the medicare advantage premium reduction 
failure to mitigate the effects of the medicare advantage premium reduction may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
as a result of the medicare prescription drug plan  our hmo affiliates have established or expanded prescription drug benefit plans for their medicare advantage members 
under the terms of our risk arrangements  we are financially responsible for a substantial portion of the cost of the prescription drugs our patients receive  and  in exchange  our hmo affiliates have agreed to provide us with an additional per member capitated fee related to prescription drug coverage 
however  there can be no assurance that the additional fee that we receive will be sufficient to reimburse us for the additional costs that we may incur under the new medicare prescription drug plan 
in addition  the premiums our hmo affiliates receive from cms for their medicare prescription drug plans is subject to periodic adjustment  positive or negative  based upon the application of risk corridors that compare their plans revenues targeted in their bids to actual prescription drug costs 
variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to the hmos or require the hmos to refund to cms a portion of the payments they received 
our contracted hmo affiliates estimate and periodically adjust premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment adjustment  and a portion of the hmo s estimated premium revenue adjustment is allocated to us 
as a result  the revenues recognized under our risk arrangements with our hmo affiliates are net of the portion of the estimated risk corridor adjustment allocated to us 
the portion of any such risk corridor adjustment that the hmos allocate to us may not directly correlate to the historical utilization patterns of our patients or the costs that we may incur in future periods 
our hmo affiliates allocated to us adjustments related to their risk corridor payments which had the effect of reducing our operating income by approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 

table of contents the medicare prescription drug plan has also been subject to significant public criticism and controversy  and members of congress have discussed possible changes to the program as well as ways to reduce the program s cost to the federal government 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  these developments may have on the medicare prescription drug plan or on our future financial results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain of the amounts recorded on our financial statements could change materially under different  yet still reasonable  estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience  knowledge of current events and expectations of future events  and we continuously evaluate and update our estimates and assumptions 
however  our estimates and assumptions may ultimately prove to be incorrect or incomplete and  as a result  our actual results may differ materially from those previously reported 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition under our risk contracts with hmos  we receive a percentage of premium or other capitated fee for each patient that chooses one of our physicians as their primary care physician 
revenue under these agreements is generally recorded in the period we assume responsibility to provide services at the rates then in effect as determined by the respective contract 
as part of the medicare advantage program  cms periodically recomputes the premiums to be paid to the hmos based on updated health status of participants and updated demographic factors 
in addition  the premiums paid to the hmos are subject to periodic adjustment based on cms s risk corridor adjustment methodology related to the medicare prescription drug plan 
we record adjustments to revenue at the time that the information necessary to make the determination of the adjustment is received from the hmo or the applicable government body and it is determined that the collectibility of such adjustments is reasonably assured or the likelihood of repayment is probable 
the net effect of these premium adjustments included in revenue were favorable retroactive medicare adjustments of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  and an unfavorable retroactive medicare adjustment of million for fiscal under our risk agreements  we assume responsibility for the cost of all medical services provided to the patient  even those we do not provide directly  in exchange for a percentage of premium or other capitated fee 
to the extent that patients require more frequent or expensive care  our revenue under a contract may be insufficient to cover the costs of care provided 
when it is probable that expected future health care costs and maintenance costs under a contract or group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated capitated revenue on those contracts  we recognize losses on our prepaid health care services with hmos 
no contracts were considered loss contracts at june  because we have the right to terminate unprofitable physicians and close unprofitable centers under our managed care contracts 
under our limited risk and non risk contracts with hmos  we receive a capitation fee or management fee based on the number of patients for which we are providing services on a monthly basis 
under our limited risk contracts  we also receive a percentage of the surplus generated as determined by the respective contract 
the fees and our portion of the surplus generated under these arrangements are recorded as revenue in the period in which services are provided as determined by the respective contract 
payments under both our risk contracts and our non risk contracts for both the medicare advantage program as well as medicaid are also subject to reconciliation based upon historical patient enrollment data 
we record any adjustments to this revenue at the time that the information necessary to make the determination of the adjustment is received from the hmo or the applicable governmental body 
medical claims expense recognition the cost of health care services provided or contracted for is accrued in the period in which the services are provided 
this cost includes our estimate of the related liability for medical claims incurred in the period but not yet reported  or ibnr 
the liability for ibnr is presented in the balance sheet netted against amounts due from hmos 
changes in this estimate can materially affect  either favorably or unfavorably  our results from operations and overall financial position 

table of contents we develop our estimate of ibnr primarily based on historical claims incurred per member per month 
we adjust our estimate if we have unusually high or low inpatient utilization or if benefit changes provided under the hmo plans are expected to significantly increase or reduce our claims exposure 
we also make adjustments for differences between the estimated claims expense recorded in prior months and actual claims expense as claims are paid by the hmo and reported to us 
we use an actuarial analysis as an additional tool to further corroborate our estimate of ibnr 
as medical claims are settled  actual amounts paid for claims incurred in prior periods vary from previously estimated liabilities 
during fiscal  amounts paid related to claims incurred in prior fiscal years were million lower than the related liability for ibnr recorded as of june  resulting in a corresponding favorable adjustment to medical claims expense in fiscal this difference represents of medical claims expense recorded in fiscal during fiscal  amounts paid related to claims incurred in prior fiscal years were million higher than the related liability for ibnr recorded as of june  resulting in a corresponding unfavorable adjustment to medical claims expense in fiscal this difference represents of medical claims expense recorded in fiscal during fiscal  amounts paid related to claims incurred in prior fiscal years were million lower than the related liability for ibnr recorded as of june  resulting in a corresponding favorable adjustment to medical claims expense in fiscal this adjustment was primarily due to the favorable resolution with the hmos of certain contested claims for which the realization of such amounts was not probable until received 
moreover  prior to the receipt of such amounts  the company lacked sufficient historical information on which to make a reasonably reliable estimate 
the favorable adjustment represents of medical claims expense recorded in fiscal based on our analysis as of june   we recorded a liability of million for ibnr which was relatively unchanged from the liability of million recorded as of june  the liability of million recorded as of june  was relatively unchanged from the liability of million recorded as of june  consideration of impairment related to goodwill and other intangible assets our balance sheet includes intangible assets  including goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets  of approximately million  which represented approximately of our total assets at june  the most significant component of the intangible assets consists of the intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of the mdhc companies 
the purchase price  including acquisition costs  of approximately million was allocated to the estimated fair value of acquired tangible assets of million  identifiable intangible assets of million and assumed liabilities of million  resulting in goodwill totaling million 
we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
we review such assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if certain indicators of impairment arise 
we amortize intangible assets with definite useful lives over their respective useful lives to their estimated residual values and also review for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators of impairment arise 
indicators of an impairment include  among other things  a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate  the loss of a key hmo contract  an adverse action by a regulator  unanticipated competition  and the loss of key personnel or allocation of goodwill to a portion of business that is to be sold 
the goodwill impairment test requires the allocation of goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to reporting units 
we have determined that we have two reporting units provider services and sleep services 
our goodwill impairment reviews are determined using a two step process 
the first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  or book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment review is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment review is required to be performed to estimate the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we completed our annual impairment test as of may   and determined that no impairment existed 
in addition  no indicators of impairment were noted and accordingly  no impairment charges were required at june  should we later determine that an indicator of impairment exists  we would be required to perform an additional impairment test 

table of contents realization of deferred income tax assets we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred income tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred income tax assets the future tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards 
we evaluate the realizability of these deferred income tax assets by assessing their valuation allowances and by adjusting the amount of such allowances  if necessary 
among the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our projections of future taxable income streams  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the impact of tax planning strategies that could be implemented to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
however  changes in tax codes  statutory tax rates or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax accruals and assets and could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
at june   we had deferred income tax liabilities in excess of deferred income tax assets of approximately million 
stock based payment we recognize compensation costs in our financial statements related to our stock based payment transactions over the period services are rendered according to the fair value of the stock based awards issued 
we have elected to calculate the fair value of our employee stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
using this model we calculated the fair value for employee stock options granted during fiscal and based on the following assumptions risk free interest rate ranging from to and to  respectively  dividend yield of  weighted average volatility factor of the expected market price of our common stock of and  respectively  and weighted average expected life of the options ranging from to years depending on the vesting provisions of each option 
the fair value for employee stock options granted during fiscal was calculated based on the following assumptions risk free interest rate ranging from to  dividend yield of  volatility factor of the expected market price of our common stock of  and weighted average expected life of the option ranging from to years depending on the vesting provisions of each option 
the expected life of the options is based on the historical exercise behavior of our employees 
the expected volatility factor is based on the historical volatility of the market price of our common stock as adjusted for certain events that management deemed to be non recurring and non indicative of future events 
we recognized share based compensation cost of million  million and million  respectively  for fiscal  and for fiscal and  we recognized excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options of approximately million and million  respectively 
for fiscal  we did not recognize any excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options 
as of june   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested options  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  it is possible that existing models may not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
we selected the black scholes model based on our experience with it  its wide use by issuers comparable to us  and our review of alternate option valuation models 
the effect of applying the fair value method of accounting for stock options on reported net income for any period may not be representative of the effects for future periods because our outstanding options typically vest over a period of several years and additional awards may be made in future periods 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected operating data as a percentage of total revenue 
year ended june  revenue operating expenses medical services medical claims other direct costs total medical services administrative payroll and employee benefits general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense interest income income before income tax provision income tax provision net income comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june revenue revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due primarily to increases in our medicare revenue 
the most significant component of our revenue is the revenue we generate from medicare patients under risk arrangements which increased by million  or  during fiscal during fiscal  revenue generated by our medicare risk arrangements increased approximately on a per patient per month basis and medicare patient months decreased by approximately over fiscal the increase in the per member per month medicare revenue was primarily due to a rate increase in medicare premiums and an increase in premiums resulting from the medicare risk adjustment program 
the decrease in medicare patient months was primarily due to the termination of at risk management services related to certain ipa practices 
effective january   the capitation payments we receive under our percentage of premium arrangements with our hmo affiliates for our medicare advantage patients decreased by approximately before taking into account any premium adjustments resulting from changes in medicare risk adjustment scores 
after taking into account our premium adjustments resulting from changes in medicare risk adjustment scores  revenue generated by our medicare risk arrangements increased approximately on a per patient per month basis for the six month period ended june  based on information received from our hmo affiliates and cms  we believe that the capitation payments we receive under our percentage of premium arrangements with our hmo affiliates for our medicare advantage patients will decrease by approximately effective january  before taking into account any adjustments resulting from changes in medicare risk adjustment scores 
presently  we do not know whether our hmo affiliates will take any action to mitigate the effect of the medicare advantage premium reduction  such as reducing plan benefits that will become effective january  we will  however  seek to improve medical claims expense management and pursue other cost reduction strategies in an effort to mitigate the effects of the medicare advantage premium reduction 
there is no assurance that our medicare capitation payments will decrease by this amount or that our cost reduction strategies will mitigate the medicare advantage premium reduction 
failure to mitigate the effects of the medicare advantage premium reduction may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
under the medicare risk adjustment program  the health status and demographic factors of medicare advantage participants are taken into account in determining premiums paid for each participant 
cms periodically recomputes the premiums to be paid to the hmos based on the updated health status and demographic factors of the medicare advantage participants 
in addition  the premiums paid to the hmos for their medicare prescription drug plan are subject to periodic adjustment based upon cms s risk corridor adjustment methodology 
the net effect of these premium adjustments included in revenue for the three month periods ended june  and were favorable retroactive medicare adjustments of million and million  respectively  and for fiscal and were favorable retroactive medicare adjustments of million and million  respectively 
future medicare risk adjustments may result in reductions of revenue depending on the future health status and demographic factors of our patients as well as the application of cms s risk corridor methodology to the hmos medicare prescription drug programs 

table of contents revenue generated by our managed care entities under contracts with humana  vista and wellcare accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenue for fiscal revenue generated by our managed care entities under contracts with humana  vista and wellcare accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenue for fiscal operating expenses medical services expenses are comprised of medical claims expense and other direct costs related to the provision of medical services to our patients 
because our risk contracts with hmos provide that we are financially responsible for the cost of substantially all medical services provided to our patients under those contracts  our medical claims expense includes the costs of prescription drugs these patients receive as well as medical services provided to patients by providers other than us 
other direct costs consist primarily of salaries  taxes and benefits of our health professionals providing primary care services including a portion of our share based compensation cost  medical malpractice insurance costs  capitation payments to our ipa physicians and fees paid to independent contractors providing medical services to our patients 
medical services expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal medical claims expense  which is the largest component of medical services expense  increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to an increase in medicare claims expense of million  or 
the increase in medicare claims expense resulted from a increase in medical claims expense on a per patient per month basis  partially offset by a decrease in medicare patient months 
the increase in medicare per patient per month medical claims expense is primarily attributable to enhanced benefits offered by our hmo affiliates in and inflationary trends in the health care industry  partially offset by improved utilization outcomes 
as a percentage of revenue  medical services expenses decreased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal our claims loss ratio medical claims expense as a percentage of revenue generated under risk arrangements decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal these decreases were primarily due to an increase in medicare revenue at a greater rate than the increase in medicare claims expense on a per patient per month basis 
hmos  however  are under continuous competitive pressure to offer enhanced and possibly more expensive benefits to their medicare advantage members 
the premiums cms pays to hmos for medicare advantage members are generally not increased as a result of those benefit enhancements 
this could increase our claims loss ratio in future periods  which could reduce our profitability and cash flows 
other direct costs increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of revenue  other direct costs remained relatively unchanged at for fiscal and the increase in the amount of other direct costs was primarily due to an increase in payroll expense and related benefits related to the operations of the sleep diagnostic centers that we acquired in fiscal administrative payroll and employee benefits expenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of revenue  administrative payroll and employee benefits expenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in administrative payroll and employee benefits expenses was primarily due to increases in personnel  annual salary increases and increases in incentive plan accruals related to our earnings in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged at for fiscal and the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to expenses related to the operations of the sleep diagnostic centers that we acquired in fiscal income from operations income from operations for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal taxes an income tax provision of million and million was recorded for fiscal and  respectively

we are required to maintain these letters of credit throughout the term of the managed care agreements 
on december   we entered into a credit facility agreement the credit facility in order to renew and refinance our existing credit facilities 
the credit facility consists of two revolving credit facilities totaling  with a maturity date of january  interest on borrowings under the credit facility accrues at a per annum rate equal to the sum of and the one month libor at june   floating daily 
the credit facility contains certain customary representations and warranties  and certain financial and other customary covenants including covenants requiring us  on a consolidated basis  to maintain an adjusted tangible net worth of at least million and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to substantially all of our assets serve as collateral for the credit facility 
at june   there was no outstanding principal balance on the credit facility 
at june   we had letters of credit outstanding of million which reduced the amount available for borrowing under the credit facility to million 
under the credit facility  we are no longer required to use certificates of deposit as collateral for outstanding letters of credit 
our board of directors approved a previously announced stock repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of  shares of our common stock 
any such repurchases will be made from time to time at the discretion of our management in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions and other factors 
we anticipate that any such repurchases of shares will be funded through cash from operations 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during fiscal during fiscal and we repurchased  shares and  shares  respectively  of our common stock for approximately million and million  respectively 
as of august   we had repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock for approximately million pursuant to this stock repurchase program

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at june   we held certificates of deposit and cash equivalent investments in high grade  short term securities  which are not typically subject to material market risk 
at june   we had capital lease obligations outstanding at fixed rates 
for loans with fixed interest rates  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have no material impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments and would have an immaterial impact on the fair value of these instruments 
our credit facility has a variable interest rate and is interest rate sensitive  however  we had no amount outstanding under the credit facility at june  we have no material risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices
