company overview since our founding in  we have established a leading position as a provider of enterprise applications software and related services designed and developed specifically for project focused organizations 
these organizations include architectural and engineering firms  government contractors  aerospace and defense contractors  information technology services firms  consulting companies  discrete project manufacturing companies  grant based not for profit organizations and government agencies  among others 
these project focused organizations generate revenue from defined  discrete customer specific engagements or activities 
project focused organizations typically require specialized software to help them automate complex business processes around the engagement  execution and delivery of projects 
our software applications enable project focused organizations to significantly enhance the visibility they have over all aspects of their operations by providing them increased control over their critical business processes  accurate  project specific financial information  and real time performance measurements 
with our software applications  project focused organizations can better measure business results  optimize performance  streamline operations and win new business 
as of december   we had over  customers worldwide that spanned numerous project focused industries and ranged in size from small organizations to large enterprises 
in addition  over  organizations and professionals rely on our innovative online govwin solution to find  capture and deliver on revenue generating government contracting opportunities 
our revenue is generated from sales of software licenses and related software maintenance and support agreements  professional services to assist customers with the implementation of our products  as well as education and training services 
our continued growth depends  in part  on our ability to generate license revenues from new customers and to continue to expand our presence by selling new products within our existing installed base of customers 
in our management decision making  we continuously balance our need to achieve short term financial and operational goals with the equally critical need to continuously invest in our products and infrastructure to ensure our future success 
in making decisions around spending levels in our various functional organizations  we consider many factors  including our ability to expand our presence and penetration of existing markets  the extent to which we can sell new products to existing customers and sell upgrades to applications from legacy products in our current portfolio  our success in expanding our network of alliance partners  our ability to expand our presence in new markets and broaden our reach geographically  and the pursuit and successful integration of acquired companies 

table of contents we have acquired companies to broaden our product offerings  expand our customer base and provide us with a future opportunity to migrate those added customers to newer applications we may develop 
the products of the acquired companies provide our customers with core functionality that complements our own established products 
in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance  we consider a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the following the growth rates of the individual components of our revenues licenses  services and support relative to recent historical trends and the growth rate of the overall market as reported or predicted by industry analysts  the margins of our business relative to recent historical trends  our operating expenses and income from operations  our cash flow from operations  the long term success of our development efforts  our ability to successfully penetrate new markets  our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and achieve anticipated synergies  our win rate against our competitors  and our long term customer retention rates 
each of the factors may be evaluated individually or collectively by our senior management team in evaluating our performance as we balance our short term quarterly objectives and our longer term strategic goals and objectives 
our total revenue for the year ended december  decreased as compared to the year ended december   as our customers deferred purchasing decisions  lengthened sales cycles and maintained more cautious investment policies in light of the current economic uncertainty 
this affected revenue from both our costpoint and vision customers 
our license revenue and total revenue for the three months ended december  increased to million and million  respectively  as compared to the three months ended september  license revenue and total revenue for the three months ended september  was million and million  respectively 
we believe the increase in revenue was attributed to increasing confidence among our customers with regard to their economic outlook 
while the timing and extent of any financial or economic turnaround remains uncertain  we expect improved confidence among our customers in the early part of as compared to the first three quarters of nonetheless  we may not experience the same level of demand in the early part of when compared to historical periods for our software solutions 
although near term predictability for license revenue remains challenging across the software industry  we also expect our costpoint  gcs premier and enterprise project management epm products to continue to account for a significant percentage of our overall software license fee revenue 
going forward  we also expect that increased government spending  increased regulation by government agencies and the economic stimulus package could benefit our government contracting customers 
while we anticipate that these trends may impact demand for our consulting  maintenance and support services in the future  it is difficult to predict when and to what extent the potential benefits of the economic stimulus package will be experienced by government contracting and other customers 
in addition  although we expect continued demand in for consulting services from customers due to additional purchases of our applications and the expansion of their use of our existing software  and continued 
table of contents demand for our maintenance services given our high maintenance retention rate and stable base of customers  we may not experience the same level of demand for consulting or maintenance and support services from our government contracting and architecture and engineering and professional services customers as they remain cautious with regard to their economic outlook 
in addition  lower software license sales in may impact our consulting services revenues in and beyond  and we may not be able to replicate the impact of large implementation projects that will come to a successful conclusion during in the three months ended december   we also experienced an increase in new customer activity among our architecture and engineering and other professional services customers  as new international customers leveraged our vision products to support their businesses 
while the timing and extent of any economic recovery remains uncertain  we expect that these current economic trends may continue in the early part of as a result  we may not experience the same level of demand when compared to historical periods for consulting  maintenance and support services from our architecture and engineering and other professional services customers due to the impact of the recession 
during  the company reduced headcount in certain areas to realign its resources 
the company anticipates additional restructuring charges in as it continues to realign its cost structure and allow for increased investment in key strategic objectives 
in light of the continuing economic challenges our customers are facing and the related impact on their purchasing decisions  we have proactively managed  and will continue to proactively manage  our business to control operating expenses and realign resources in a way that will allow us to maximize near term opportunities while maintaining the flexibility needed to achieve our longer term strategic goals 
history we were founded to develop and sell accounting software solutions for firms that contract with the us government 
since our founding  we have continued our focus on providing solutions to government contractors as well as to other project focused organizations  and at the same time we have broadened our product offerings by developing new software products  selectively acquiring businesses with attractive project focused applications and services  and partnering with third parties 
in april  new mountain partners ii  lp  new mountain affiliated investors ii  lp  and allegheny new mountain partners  lp collectively  the new mountain funds purchased the majority ownership of our company from the founding delaski stockholders through a recapitalization transaction 
subsequent to this transaction  we implemented a strategy to recruit additional management talent and significantly improve our competitive position and growth prospects through increased investments in product development and sales and marketing initiatives  complemented by strategic acquisitions aimed at broadening our customer base and our product offerings

critical accounting policies and estimates in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
some of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our future estimates may change if the underlying assumptions change 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
for further information on our critical and other significant accounting policies  see note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
we believe that the critical accounting policies listed below involve our more significant judgments  assumptions and estimates and  therefore  could have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition  stock based compensation  
table of contents income taxes  allowances for doubtful accounts receivable  valuation of purchased intangible assets and acquired deferred revenue  and impairment of identifiable intangible and other long lived assets and goodwill 
in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification the codification or asc  the authoritative guidance for gaap 
the codification does not change how we account for transactions or the nature of the related disclosures made 
the codification supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards and was effective beginning july  in this annual report on form k  the references have been updated to reflect the new codification references 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with asc  software revenue recognition asc  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the aicpa  and in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from three primary sources  or elements software license fees for our products  maintenance and support for those products  and consulting services  including training  related to those products 
a typical sales agreement includes both software licenses and maintenance and may also include consulting services and training 
software license fee revenues for sales arrangements involving multiple elements where the software does not require significant modification or customization  we recognize software license fee revenues using the residual method as described in asc because to date we have not established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for the license element 
under the residual method  we allocate revenue to  and defer recognition of  undelivered elements based on their vsoe of fair value and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements as revenue for the delivered elements 
the vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements in multiple element arrangements is based on the price charged when such elements are sold separately 
our typical undelivered elements maintenance and consulting services are priced consistently such that vsoe generally exists for undelivered elements of our arrangements 
if vsoe exists to allow the allocation of a portion of the total fee to undelivered elements of the arrangement  the residual amount in the arrangement allocated to software license fee is recognized as revenue when all of the following are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
it is our practice to require a signed contract or an accepted purchase order for existing customers 
delivery has occurred 
we deliver software by secure electronic means or physical delivery 
both means of delivery transfer title and risk to the customer 
shipping terms are generally fob shipping point 
the software license sale is fixed and determinable 
we recognize revenue for the license component of multiple element arrangements only when the vsoe of fair value of any undelivered elements is known  any uncertainties surrounding customer acceptance are resolved and there are no refund  return or cancellation rights associated with the delivered elements 
software license sales are generally considered fixed and determinable when payment terms are within days 
collectibility is probable 
amounts receivable must be collectible 
for license arrangements that do not meet our collectibility standards  revenue is recognized as cash is received 

table of contents consulting services revenues our consulting services revenues  which include software implementation  training and other consulting services  are generally billed based on hourly rates plus reimbursable out of pocket expenses and related administrative fees 
these services are generally not essential to the functionality of our software and are usually completed in three to six months  though larger implementations may take longer 
we generally recognize revenues for these services as they are performed 
in rare situations in which the services are deemed essential to the functionality of our software in the customer s environment  we recognize the software and services revenue together in accordance with asc  revenue recognition construction type and certain production type contracts asc 
we sell training at a fixed rate for each specific class  at a per attendee price  or at a packaged price for several attendees  and revenue is recognized only when the customer completes the training 
to the extent that our customers pay for the training services in advance of delivery  the amounts are recorded in deferred revenue until such time as the training is provided 
maintenance and support services revenues maintenance and support services include software updates on a when and if available basis  telephone  online and web based support and software defect fixes or patches 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the customer maintenance and support agreement 
the significant judgments and estimates for revenue recognition typically relate to the timing of an amount recognized for software license fee revenue  including whether collectibility is deemed probable  fees are fixed and determinable and services are essential to the functionality of the software 
changes to these assumptions would generally impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized for software license fee revenues versus other revenue categories 
stock based compensation asc  compensation stock compensation asc  requires that the cost of awards of equity instruments offered in exchange for employee services  including employee stock options  restricted stock awards  and employee stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan espp  are measured based on the fair value of the award on the measurement date of grant 
we determine the fair value of options granted using the black scholes merton option pricing model and recognize the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  generally the vesting period 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the awards 
in accordance with asc  we recorded million  million and million in stock based compensation expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the compensation expense recorded for the years ended december  and related to stock options  restricted stock awards and the espp  and for the year ended december   the compensation expense recorded related to stock options and espp 
the key assumptions used by management in the black scholes merton option pricing model include the fair value of our common stock at the grant date  which is also used to determine the option exercise price  the expected life of the option  the expected volatility of our common stock over the life of the option and the risk free interest rate 
in determining the amount of stock based compensation to record  management must also estimate expected forfeitures of stock options over the expected life of the options 
prior to our initial public offering in november and given the absence of an active market for our common stock  our board of directors or compensation committee or its authorized member s estimated the fair value of our common stock at the time of each grant 
numerous objective and subjective factors were 
table of contents considered in estimating the value of our common stock at each option grant date in accordance with the guidance in aicpa practice aid valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation 
based on these factors  employee stock options were granted during at exercise prices ranging from to 
our initial public offering in november was per share 
valuation methodology from january  through the initial public offering  the valuation method that we used to estimate the fair value of our common stock utilized a combination of a market multiple methodology and a comparable transaction methodology 
the market multiple methodology considered market valuation multiples of similar enterprise application software firms the comparable software companies 
we selected seven comparable companies that met the following criteria the company was primarily engaged in the enterprise software business  the company was publicly held and actively traded  and the enterprise value of the company was less than billion 
based on an analysis of the valuation multiples of the comparable software companies  we determined an appropriate multiple to apply to the relevant values for our cumulative earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  recapitalization expenses and stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda for the four quarters ended prior to the valuation date  our estimated adjusted ebitda for the current period  determined as of the valuation date based on management s estimates  and for periods beginning in october  our estimated adjusted ebitda for the result of this calculation was an estimate of our enterprise value using market multiples of comparable software companies 
the comparable transaction methodology considered market valuation multiples of over software company acquisition transactions announced since early we selected transactions for this methodology from databases of publicly announced and completed controlling interest transactions involving enterprise software companies valued between million and billion 
the analysis of comparable transactions included for each valuation was consistently updated to include transactions announced and completed since the prior valuation 
the factors considered in our comparable transaction methodology analysis were the acquired company s enterprise value to revenue multiple and its enterprise value to adjusted ebitda ratio 
after analysis of the range of values of those comparable transactions as well as their mean and median values  a range of comparable enterprise value multiples that considered our growth rate and adjusted ebitda margin levels was applied to our revenue and adjusted ebitda levels 
we further adjusted this value to remove the estimated impact of the control premium from the market multiples used 
the result of this calculation was an estimate of our enterprise value using comparable transaction multiples of other acquired software firms 
the application of the market multiple methodology and the comparable transaction methodology was equally weighted and yielded an estimated enterprise value which we then adjusted for our cash and debt balances to estimate the aggregate value of our common stock 
we then adjusted that valuation for a marketability discount ranging from to depending upon the proximity of an expected liquidity event 
table of contents such as our planned initial public offering to reflect the fact that our shares were not publicly tradable 
the resulting valuation of our company was used to determine the estimated fair value of our common stock at the valuation date 
subsequent to our initial public offering in november  the fair value of our common stock has been determined based upon the closing stock market value 
because we do not have significant history associated with our stock options in order to determine the expected volatility of our options  we calculated expected volatility as of each grant date using an implied volatility method based in part on reported data for a peer group of publicly traded software companies for which historical information was available 
we will continue to use peer group volatility information until sufficient historical volatility of our common stock is available to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
the average expected life of our stock options was determined according to the sec simplified method as described in sab no 
 share based payment  which is the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
the risk free interest rate was determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve rates with the remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
forfeitures were estimated based on our historical analysis of actual stock option forfeitures and employee turnover 
an increase or decrease by in the forfeiture rate would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we record this amount as a provision or benefit for taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits and assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our financial statements 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from our estimates reflected in our income tax provision 
as such  any potential difference could have a material effect on our effective tax rate and consequently affect our operating results for the period in which such determination is made 
we follow asc which requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position 
changes in judgment as to recognition and measurement of tax positions can affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our operating results 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million  which were primarily related to differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expenses for book and tax purposes 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we have no valuation allowances as we have determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded at the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
if a change to the expected tax rate is determined to be appropriate due to differences between our assumptions and actual results of operations or statutory tax rates  it will affect the provision for income taxes during the period that the determination is made 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales allowances to provide adequate provision for potential losses from collecting less than full payment on our accounts receivable 
we record provisions for sales allowances  which generally result from credits issued to customers in conjunction with cancellations of maintenance agreements or billing adjustments  as a reduction to revenues 
we record provisions for bad debt  or 
table of contents credit losses  as a general and administrative expense in our income statement 
we base these provisions on a review of our accounts receivable aging  individual overdue accounts  historical write offs and adjustments of customer accounts due to service or other issues and an assessment of the general economic environment 
valuation of purchased intangible assets and acquired deferred revenue we allocate the purchase price paid in a business combination to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions and estimates we believe to be reasonable 
these estimates are based upon a number of factors  including historical experience  market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include  but are not limited to  historical and projected customer retention rates  anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer and product base and the expected use of the acquired assets 
we amortize acquired intangible assets using either accelerated or straight line methods depending upon which best approximates the proportion of future cash flows estimated to be generated in each period of the estimated useful life of the specific asset 
management must estimate the expected life and future cash flows from the acquired asset  both of which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
changes in the assumptions used in developing these estimates could have a material impact on the amortization expense recorded in our financial statements 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of our assumptions and estimates 
as an example  for all of the acquisitions made during the years through  we are amortizing the customer relationship intangible assets on an accelerated method using lives of five to ten years 
the use of an accelerated method was based upon our estimates of the projected cash flows from the assets and the proportion of those cash flows received over the estimated life 
had we used a straight line method of amortization  amortization expense for would have been approximately million less than the amount recorded 
if we were to continue to use the same accelerated method  but reduce the estimated useful lives of those assets by one year  total amortization expense would have been higher by million for we amortize acquired technology from our acquisitions using either an accelerated or a straight line method over two to four years 
if the useful lives for those assets were reduced by one year  amortization expense for would have been approximately million which is million lower than the current year expense 
as a component of our acquisitions  we acquired maintenance obligations and the associated deferred revenue with our acquisitions 
we valued acquired deferred revenue based on estimates of the cost of providing solution support services plus a reasonable profit margin 
upon each acquisition  the acquired deferred revenue balances were recorded at an average of of their book value on the date of acquisition 
this reduced deferred revenue amount is recognized as revenue over the remaining contractual period of the obligation  generally no more than one year from the date of acquisition 
changes in the estimates used in determining these valuations could result in more or less revenue being recorded 
impairment of identifiable intangible and other long lived assets and goodwill we review identifiable intangible and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with asc  property  plant  and equipment asc whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired or unrecoverable 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc 
accordingly  we test our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually at december or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
the impairment test for goodwill compares the fair value of the reporting unit 
table of contents with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  impairment is indicated 
the impairment is measured as the excess of the recorded goodwill over its fair value 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets compares the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  an impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair market value 
factors that indicate the carrying amount of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets or other long lived assets that may not be recoverable include under performance relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes or limitations in the manner of our use of the acquired assets  changes in our business strategy  adverse market conditions  changes in applicable laws or regulations and a variety of other factors and circumstances 
we determine the recoverability of our long lived assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to our current estimates of net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate or fair market value 
if we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable  an impairment charge is recognized  as an operating expense  equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the asset in the period the determination is made

we sell our software applications to end user customers mainly through our direct sales force  as well as indirectly through our network of alliance partners and resellers 
the timing of the sales cycle for our products varies in length based upon a variety of factors  including the size of the customer  the product being sold and whether the customer is a new or existing customer 
while price is an important consideration  we primarily compete on product features  functionality and the needs of our customers within our served markets 
software license fee revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   license fee revenues from our costpoint  gcs premier and epm products decreased million compared with the prior year  while license fee revenues from our vision software license fees decreased by million for the same period 
the decrease in revenues from sales of our costpoint  gcs premier and enterprise project management epm products to government contractor customers was partially attributable to the impact of two larger deals in that were not replicated in  and was also attributable to customers taking a more cautious approach with regard to purchasing and investment decisions 
we believe the decrease in revenues from sales of our vision products was mainly attributable to customers deferring purchasing decisions  lengthening sales cycles and adopting more cautious investment policies during the current economic downturn 
while the timing and extent of any financial or economic turnaround remains uncertain  we expect improved confidence among our customers in the early part of as compared to the first three quarters of nonetheless  we may not experience the same level of demand in the early part of when compared to historical periods for our software solutions 
software license fee revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   revenues from vision software license fees decreased million compared with the prior year primarily due to a number of architecture and engineering customers that deferred purchasing decisions  lengthened sales cycles and slowed the adoption of new technologies as their focus turned to the impact of the escalating financial crisis on their businesses in the latter half of software license fee revenue from our costpoint  gcs premier  and epm products increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  by million driven by continued demand for our products by government contractors 
consulting services our consulting services revenues are generated from software implementation and related project management and data conversion  as well as training  education and other consulting services associated with our software applications and are typically provided on a time and materials basis 

table of contents consulting services revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this is a result of a million decline in software implementation consulting services attributed to decreased software license fees 
also contributing to the decrease was a decline of million in reimbursable revenues and a decline of million in training and education related services 
implementation services represented of total consulting revenues for the year ended december   compared to in the prior year 
although we expect continued demand in for consulting services from customers due to additional purchases of our applications and the expansion of their use of our existing software  we may not be able to replicate the impact of large implementation projects that will come to a successful conclusion during  and lower software license sales in may also impact our consulting services revenues in and beyond 
in addition  we may not experience the same level of demand as previously experienced from our government contracting and architecture and engineering and professional services customers as they remain cautious with respect to their economic outlook 
consulting services revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in revenue year over year was driven by an increase of million of software implementation related services in addition to an increase of million in training and education related services revenue in the increase in software implementation related services was a result of increased demand for implementation services and more billable services headcount 
maintenance and support services our maintenance and support revenues are comprised of fees derived from new maintenance contracts associated with new software license sales and annual renewals of existing maintenance contracts 
these contracts typically allow our customers to obtain online  telephone and internet based support  as well as unspecified periodic upgrades or enhancements to our software on an as available basis 
maintenance services generally represent between and of the list price of the underlying software applications at the time of sale and are generally subject to contractually permitted annual rate increases 
maintenance revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  maintenance revenues from our costpoint  gcs premier  and epm products collectively increased million year over year  and maintenance revenues from our vision products increased million 
in addition  the sales allowance decreased million 
these increases were due to sales of new software licenses  renewals of maintenance agreements by our installed base of customers  the annual price escalations for our maintenance services and the impact of the mpm acquisition 
we expect that maintenance revenues will continue to be a significant source of revenue during the early part of given our high maintenance retention rate and our stable base of customers 
maintenance revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  maintenance revenues from our costpoint  gcs premier  and epm products collectively increased million year over year and maintenance revenues from our vision product increased million 
these increases were due to sales of new software licenses  renewals of maintenance agreements on our installed base of customers  and the annual price escalations for our maintenance services 
these increases were partially offset by customer cancellations 
other revenues our other revenues consist primarily of fees collected for our annual user conference  which is typically held in the second quarter of the year  as well as sales of third party hardware and software 
for the year ended december   other revenues decreased million  or  to million from million in the prior year as a result of lower user conference revenues associated with lower conference attendance in the current year 

table of contents for the year ended december   other revenues decreased million  or  to million compared to the year ended december  as a result of a decrease in third party hardware and software revenue of million year over year

cost of software license fees decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to lower amortization of capitalized software and purchased intangible assets 
cost of software license fees decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily a result of decreased royalty expense for third party software of million driven by lower software license sales during the year ended december  in addition  there was a decrease in amortization from purchased intangibles of million and capitalized software of million 
the decrease in amortization of software development costs was a result of previously capitalized software becoming fully amortized in the prior year resulting in no current year expense

the income tax expense for is lower than the income tax expense for due primarily to the lower pre tax income as well as various newly implemented tax strategies including increased credits for qualified research and development activities  the expected utilization of foreign tax credits not scheduled to expire for ten years  and the deductibility of certain expenses 
income tax expense decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a percentage of pre tax income  income tax expense was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of realizing tax benefits from losses in foreign subsidiaries  and realizing increased tax benefits from research and development tax credits and certain tax deductions and adjustments resulting from a detailed functional and economic analysis of related party transactions reflected in our updated transfer pricing agreements 
as a result of this change in geographic distribution of income  we released all of the valuation allowance we had previously recorded because we determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the tax benefits associated with its foreign losses

credit agreement the company has maintained a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by credit suisse the credit agreement since in august  the company amended the credit agreement 
at the time of the amendment  the company had term loans of million outstanding and a million revolving credit facility on which there were no borrowings 
the term loans and revolving credit facility were to expire on april  and april   respectively 
as a result of the amendment  the company extended the maturity of million of term loans to april  in addition  the expiration of million of the revolving credit facility was extended to april  the remaining million of term loans mature and million of the revolving credit facility continues to expire on april  and april   respectively 
the non extended portion of the term loans continues to accrue interest at a rate of above the british banker s association interest settlement rates for dollar deposits 
the non extended portion of the revolving credit facility continues to accrue interest at a rate of or  depending on the type of borrowing 
the spread above the libo rate decreases as the company s leverage ratio  as defined in the amended credit 
table of contents agreement  decreases 
the interest rate for the extended portion of both the term loans and the revolving credit facility is the libo rate plus with a libor floor of 
in addition  the company will pay an annual fee equal to of the undrawn portion on the revolving credit facility that was extended to april  as of december  and december   the outstanding amount of the term loans was million and million  respectively  and there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
all the loans under the amended credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets including our subsidiaries assets and require us to comply with financial covenants requiring us to maintain defined minimum levels of interest coverage and fixed charges coverage and providing for a limitation on our leverage ratio 
the financial ratio covenants in the amended credit agreement remained unchanged 
the following table summarizes the significant financial covenants under the amended credit agreement adjusted ebitda below is as defined in the amended credit agreement as of december  most restrictive required level covenant requirement calculation required level actual level minimum interest coverage cumulative adjusted ebitda for the prior four quarters consolidated interest expense greater than to greater than to effective january  minimum fixed charges coverage cumulative adjusted ebitda for the prior four quarters interest expense principal payments capital expenditures capitalized software costs cash tax payments greater than greater than leverage coverage total debt cumulative adjusted ebitda for the prior four quarters less than to less than to the amended credit agreement also requires us to comply with non financial covenants that restrict or limit certain corporate activities by us and our subsidiaries  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  guarantee obligations  or create liens on our assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  engage in mergers or consolidations  or pay cash dividends 
based on our current and expected performance  we believe we will continue to satisfy the financial covenants of our amended credit agreement for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants related to our amended credit agreement 
in connection with the amended credit agreement  we incurred debt issuance costs of million during the third quarter of  of which million will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the modified debt 
previously deferred debt issuance costs that existed at the time of the credit agreement amendment will also be amortized over the remaining term of the modified debt 
we incurred no debt issuance costs in and debt issuance costs have generally been amortized and reflected in interest expense over the lives of the respective loans 
at december   million of unamortized debt issuance costs remained in prepaid expenses and other current assets and million was reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
during the years ended december    and  costs of million  million and million  respectively  were amortized and reflected in interest expense 
the december  amount included  of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs as a result of prepayments on the term loans 
table of contents from the annual excess cash flow in the first quarter of and due to the completion of the rights offering in the second quarter of the december  amount included  of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs as a result of the company s prepayment on the term loans in the fourth quarter of for fiscal year  there was no accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs 
the amended credit agreement requires mandatory prepayments of the term loans from our annual excess cash flow  as defined in the amended credit agreement  and from the net proceeds of certain asset sales or equity issuances 
during the first quarter of  we made a scheduled principal payment of  and a contractually required principal prepayment of million from our annual excess cash flow 
the amended credit agreement also requires us to prepay a portion of the term loans from the net proceeds of certain equity issuances to certain investors so that our leverage ratio as defined in the amended credit agreement is less than 
in connection with our common stock rights offering  we were required to make a mandatory principal prepayment of approximately million from the net proceeds from the rights offering  as our leverage ratio was greater than to prior to the completion of the rights offering 
the mandatory excess cash flow payment made in march was applied first against the scheduled principal payments under the original credit agreement for a twelve month period and  secondly  with the excess applied ratably against the remaining debt payments in the amortization schedule under the original credit agreement 
the prepayment from our rights offering was applied ratably against the remaining debt payments under the original credit agreement 
we expect to pay a mandatory prepayment of the term loans from our excess cash flow at march  a payment of million will be due which will be applied pro rata against the non extended and extended term loans 
the payments will be applied against regularly scheduled principal payments for a twelve month period and  secondly  with the excess applied ratably against the remaining debt payments for the outstanding term loans 
see discussion below in contractual obligations and commitments for our future scheduled principal payments on the amended credit agreement 
liquidity and capital resources overview of liquidity our primary operating cash requirements include the payment of salaries  incentive compensation and related benefits  and other headcount related costs as well as the costs of office facilities and information technology systems 
we fund these requirements through cash collections from our customers for the purchase of our software  consulting services and maintenance services 
amounts due from customers for software license and maintenance services are generally billed in advance of the contract period 
the cost of our acquisitions has been financed with available cash flow and  to the extent necessary  short term borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
these borrowings were repaid in subsequent periods with available cash provided by operating activities as well as with proceeds from our initial public offering 
we utilize our revolving credit facility for the additional purpose of providing the required guarantee related to certain letters of credit for our real estate leases 
at december   the total amount of letters of credit guaranteed under the revolving credit facility was million 
as a result  available borrowings on the revolving credit facility at december  were million 
historically  our cash flows have been subject to variability from year to year  primarily as a result of one time or infrequent events 
we expect that our future growth will continue to require additional working capital 
although such future working capital requirements are difficult to forecast  based on our current estimates of revenues and expenses we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations and available sources of funds including available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity for us to fund our business and meet our obligations for the next twelve months 
in addition  our amended credit 
table of contents agreement provides for greater financial flexibility by extending our debt repayments over a longer term 
we also believe that the aggregate cash balance of million as of december  is sufficient to cover the payments due over the next eighteen months of million under the amended credit agreement 
in the future  however  we may require additional liquidity to fund our operations  strategic investments and acquisitions  and debt repayment obligations  which could entail raising additional funds or further refinancing of our amended credit agreement 
in june  we completed our common stock rights offering  which was fully subscribed by our stockholders  resulting in the issuance of million shares of common stock 
net proceeds after deducting fees and offering expenses were approximately million 
we used approximately million to prepay indebtedness under our credit agreement and intend to use the remaining net proceeds from the rights offering for additional working capital  strategic investments and acquisitions  reduction of indebtedness or general corporate purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our initial public offering 
the net proceeds to the company were million which were used to repay a million balance on our revolving credit facility and to make a million prepayment on our term loans 
analysis of cash flows for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million provided during the comparable period of the increase of million was attributed to a decrease in cash payments of million for taxes  million in interest and million in other operating activities partially offset by an increase in cash payments for restructuring charges of million 
the increase in deferred revenue of million was primarily attributed to accelerating our maintenance billing process in the second quarter of for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million provided during the comparable period of this increase of million is primarily driven by the additional cash associated with increased customer payments of million offset by higher cash payments for income taxes and other expenses during the year ended december  beginning in  all maintenance billing will generally occur on an annual rather than quarterly basis which will result in an expected increase in deferred revenue in net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million used during the comparable period of our use of cash during the year ended december  was for the acquisition of mysbx of million  purchase of property and equipment of million and capitalized software development costs of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million used during the comparable period of the increase of million is due to cash used in of million for the acquisition of mpm  aim contingent consideration of million  and additional consideration for welcom of million as compared to for which we paid million for aim and wstp 
other cash used in investing activities of million was associated with purchases of property and equipment in net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million provided during the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was primarily related to proceeds received from our rights offering of million  net of issuance costs  and proceeds from issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan espp as well as stock option exercises of million 
this was offset by million in debt repayments and payments for deferred financing costs of million 
debt repayments consisted of a scheduled cash repayment of million and contractually required prepayments of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million provided during the year ended december  this decrease is due to proceeds from our initial public offering in the fourth quarter of of million  million in proceeds from the issuance 
table of contents of debt in  offset by higher debt repayments of million in in addition  proceeds from exercise of stock options  issuance of stock under our espp plan and the related tax benefit on options were higher by million in the proceeds from the stock option activity in were offset by million in payments made in to stockholders and the redemption of stock in relation to our capitalization 
we used million in net proceeds from our initial public offering to pay down million of indebtedness on our outstanding revolving credit facility and million on our term loan 
as of december  we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility 
impact of seasonality fluctuations in our quarterly software license fee revenues have historically reflected  in part  seasonal fluctuations driven by our customers procurement cycles for enterprise software and other factors 
these factors have historically yielded a peak in software license fee revenue in the fourth quarter due to increased spending by our customers during that time 
however  as a result of the current economic environment  the seasonality of our business has been impacted by our customers views of their economic outlook 
therefore  past seasonality may not be indicative of current or future seasonality 
our consulting services revenues are impacted by software license sales  the availability of consulting resources to work on customer implementations  and the adequacy of our contracting activity to maintain full utilization of available resources 
as a result  services revenues are much less subject to seasonal fluctuations 
our maintenance revenues are not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
our material capital commitments consist of term loan related debt obligations and commitments under facilities and operating leases 
we rarely enter into binding purchase commitments 
the following table summarizes our existing contractual obligations and contractual commitments as of december  payments due by december  contractual obligations total thereafter dollars in thousands term loan operating leases liability for redemption of stock in recapitalization the table above does not include interest payments with respect to the outstanding term loans 
interest expense associated with the non extended portion of our term loans is variable and therefore fluctuates with interest rate fluctuations in the market 
based on the variable rate debt outstanding as of december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would only increase interest expense by approximately million on an annual basis  because the current libo rate on the fixed rate portion of our term loans was more than lower than the libor floor applicable to our term loans 
following the repayment of million in the fourth quarter of  our scheduled repayments on the outstanding amount of the term loans are as detailed in the above table 
however  the amount and timing of these scheduled payments could vary based on the required mandatory prepayments from our annual excess cash flow  and from the net proceeds of certain asset sales or equity issuances as defined in the amended credit agreement 
the repayment in of million includes scheduled repayments of million and a prepayment of million from our annual excess cash flow 
we expect to make million  million and million in principal payments by march   september  and december   respectively 

table of contents the above table does not include approximately million of long term income tax liabilities recorded in accordance with asc because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of these potential future payments 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
indemnification we provide limited indemnification to our customers against intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties arising from the use of our software products 
due to the established nature of our primary software products and the lack of intellectual property infringement claims in the past  we cannot estimate the fair value nor determine the total nominal amount of the indemnification  if any 
estimated losses for such indemnification are evaluated under asc  contingencies  as interpreted by asc  guarantees 
we have secured copyright and trademark registrations for our software products with the us patent and trademark office  and we have intellectual property infringement indemnification from our third party partners whose technology may be embedded or otherwise bundled with our software products 
therefore  we generally consider the probability of an unfavorable outcome in an intellectual property infringement case to be relatively low 
we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asc  business combinations  which replaces the former standard sfas asc requires assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination  contingent consideration  and certain acquired contingencies to be measured at their fair values as of the date of acquisition

the guidance in asc requires the recognition at fair value of an asset or liability assumed 
table of contents in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition date fair value can be reasonably estimated during the measurement period 
if the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated  the asset or liability would be recognized in accordance with asc  contingencies  if the criteria in asc were met at the acquisition date 
previously  asc required pre acquisition contingencies to be measured at fair value at the date of acquisition 
asc is effective for business combinations occurring after january  beginning in  we adopted asc  however  we did not acquire any pre acquisition contingencies in our acquisition 
in april  the fasb issued asc  financial instruments transition  effective for interim periods ending after june  asc requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements to improve the transparency and quality of financial reporting 
asc amends asc  interim reporting  to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods

asc also provides guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
in addition  asc requires disclosure in interim and annual periods of the inputs and valuation methods used in determining fair value and a discussion of any changes in those valuation methods 
asc is effective for annual and interim periods ending on or after june  during the second quarter of  we adopted the provisions in asc the provisions adopted did not have an impact on our financial statements as our fair value measurements are level measurements in an active market with orderly transactions

in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
asu  fair value measurement and disclosure measuring liabilities at fair value  which amends asc the guidance in asu provides clarification on measuring liabilities at fair value when a quoted price in an active market is not available 
the asu specifies that a valuation technique should be applied that uses either the quote of the liability when traded as an asset  the quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets  or another valuation technique consistent with existing fair value measurement guidance such as a present value technique or a technique that is based on the amount at the measurement date that the reporting entity would pay to transfer the identical liability or would receive to enter into the identical liability 
the guidance also states that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustments to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability 
asu is effective for the first reporting period beginning after issuance  or october  the adoption of asu did not have an impact on our financial statements as we currently do not have any liabilities measured at fair value 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  and the fasb issued asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  on revenue recognition that will become effective for the company beginning january   with earlier adoption permitted 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our outstanding debt and cash and cash equivalents consisting primarily of funds held in money market accounts on a short term basis with no withdrawal restrictions 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
our interest expense associated with the non extended portion of our term loans and revolving credit facility will vary with market rates 
as of december   we had approximately million in debt outstanding  of which million is set at a fixed rate  due to the libor floor established in the amended credit agreement  and the remaining million is at a variable rate 
based upon the variable rate debt outstanding as of december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately million on an annual basis  and likewise decrease our earnings and cash flows 
however  an increase in libor subsequent to december  could cause our fixed rate debt to become variable and our interest expense to vary 
we cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on our variable rate debt  or whether fixed rate long term debt will be available to us at favorable rates  if at all 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the hypothetical increase discussed above 
based on the investment interest rate and our cash and cash equivalents balance as of december   a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately million on an annual basis  and likewise decrease our earnings and cash flows 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound  the philippine peso  and the australian dollar 
as our international operations continue to grow  we may choose to use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage currency exposures 
we do not currently have any such contracts in place  nor did we have any such contracts during   or to date  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on our operating results and cash flows given the scope of our international presence 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements
