items and a 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are an integrated energy company operating principally in the united states with two major business groups utilities and non regulated energy 
we report for our business groups in the following financial segments business group financial segment utilities electric utilities gas utilities non regulated energy oil and gas power generation coal mining energy marketing our utilities group consists of our regulated electric and gas utility segments 
our electric utilities segment generates  transmits and distributes electricity to approximately  customers in south dakota  wyoming  colorado and montana and includes the operations of cheyenne light and its approximately  gas utility customers in wyoming 
our gas utilities segment serves approximately  natural gas customers in colorado  nebraska  iowa and kansas 
our non regulated energy group engages in the production of coal  natural gas and crude oil primarily in the rocky mountain region  the production of electric power through ownership of a portfolio of generating plants and the sale of electric power and capacity primarily under mid and long term contracts  and the marketing of natural gas  crude oil and related services 
industry overview the united states energy industry experienced a second consecutive tumultuous year in energy commodity prices  which were near historic highs in july  with natural gas trading over per mcf and crude oil selling for nearly per barrel  experienced dramatic declines to less than and  respectively  by february the global economic crisis that commenced in late and continued through significantly reduced energy demand 
in addition  domestic energy prices continued to be influenced by global factors  including foreign economic conditions especially in china and asia  the policies of opec and other large foreign oil producers  and political tensions and conflict in many regions 
mild weather dominated the united states during much of the year  further reducing demand for fuel used for power generation and heating 
beginning in late summer  a proliferation of sub prime lending produced a global credit crisis 
other credit quality concerns also emerged  creating an international scale financial crisis  plunging the united states economy into its worst recession since the s 
the capital markets were impacted dramatically by the crisis during late and the first several months of  severely inhibiting the ability of companies to raise both debt and equity capital  and significantly increasing the cost of capital 
for creditworthy companies  the capital markets improved materially beginning in the second quarter of like other united states industries  the energy industry is faced with numerous uncertainties  both short and long term 
many utilities have large capital spending needs over the next few years to replace aging infrastructure  and to add new assets such as transmission lines and renewable energy resources 
utility companies generally are less impacted by economic downturns  but the prolonged  severe recession has affected the demand for energy services and the ability of customers to pay their utility bills  particularly in certain parts of the country 
the recession has also impacted the ability of companies to obtain the capital necessary for infrastructure expansion 
the state utility regulatory climate in remained relatively constructive among government  industry and consumer representatives 
in the seven state region encompassing our utility operations  regulators were willing to establish rates based on multi year considerations  including fuel and other reasonable cost adjustments  justifiable capital expenditures for maintenance and expansion of energy systems  and a response to environmental concerns through demand management and energy efficiency programs 
challenges remain  however  in obtaining satisfactory rate recovery for utility investments due to the general state of the economy and concern by regulators in various states that utility rate increases may cause further harm to local economies 
at the federal level  the november elections caused a significant change in the domestic political environment  and a dramatic shift in domestic policy 
the passage of a major economic stimulus package by congress early in  and the bailout of several too large to fail financial firms and automobile manufacturers  set the stage for an emphasis on increased regulation and government oversight of industry  which continued throughout the year 
despite all of the focus on the economy  environmental issues remained a priority for the president and many in congress 
federal legislation  mandating the reduction of ghg emissions utilizing a cap and trade system and increased renewable energy use  passed the house and was introduced in the senate 
although it did not pass during  the legislation remains a key priority of the president and congressional leadership 
in addition  in late  congress focused on the passage of major healthcare reform legislation 
these potential legislative actions could have significant macroeconomic consequences  as the associated cost increases may cause a dramatic increase in consumer costs for products and services  including rates for electricity and other energy in the mid to long term 
state legislatures also remained active on environmental issues in  with a majority of states now having adopted some form of renewable energy standard  including some in which we operate 
in addition  several states have passed greenhouse gas emissions legislation  which places limits on the emissions of co and other greenhouse gases 
progress in the domestic energy industry during included increasing levels of domestic natural gas production activity  particularly related to the various shale resource plays  planning and construction of liquefied natural gas port facilities  proposals for additional gas fired  coal fired and nuclear power plants  planning for additional electric transmission capacity  and the advancement of renewable energy resources and utilization 
the energy industry continues to adjust to change  although the economic crisis suppressed the recent trend of consolidation in the electric and gas utility sectors 
the energy marketplace continues to respond to increased the oversight and enforcement activity of ferc  and increased environmental and emissions reviews and mandates 
in recent years  several state regulatory agencies allowed electric utilities to construct and operate power plants in vertically integrated structures after years of discouraging or prohibiting such activity 
over the last several years  the corporate structure of many energy companies underwent evaluation and change  in large part due to efforts to create additional shareholder value 
prior to the economic crisis  a number of companies contemplated or implemented a realignment of business lines  reflecting a shift in long term strategies 
some divested certain energy properties to focus on core businesses  such as exiting non regulated power production  energy marketing or oil and gas production in favor of more stable utility operations 
others engaged in mergers and acquisitions with a goal to improve economies of scale and returns to investors 
private equity investors continued to play a role in the changing composition of energy ownership  but to a lesser extent following the economic crisis 
many industry analysts cite the need for expanded energy capacity and delivery systems 
they continue to foresee an increase in capital investment across a wide spectrum of energy companies 
many electric and gas utilities must replace aging plant and equipment  and regulators appear willing to provide acceptable rate treatment for additional utility investment  although the current state of the economy makes rate recovery more challenging in the short run 
oil and gas producers will continue to explore for new reserves  particularly of natural gas  which will be the primary fuel of choice in light of concern regarding greenhouse gas emissions and the need to provide backup generation for renewable energy resources 
the growing focus on environmental regulation made it increasingly more difficult to obtain drilling permits  particularly on public and native american lands 
however  in the short term  low natural gas prices prompted companies to curtail projects in order to conserve cash during a period of low cash flow and constrained capital markets 
in early  the domestic coal industry benefited from a positive price environment  in large part due to high and volatile natural gas prices 
coal prices have moderated considerably in response to a trend of lower overall natural gas prices 
powder river basin coal btu per pound was per ton in december and by the end of it was as low as per ton or a decline of 
fossil fuel combustion continues to be a contentious domestic and international public policy issue  as many nations  including united states allies  advocate reductions in co and other emissions 
many states now encourage the energy industry to invest in renewable energy resources  such as wind or solar power  or the use of bio mass as a fuel 
in many instances  renewable energy use is mandated by state regulators 
several years ago  the state of california mandated that future imports of power must come from power plants with emission levels no greater than combined cycle natural gas fired plants 
such restrictions may alter transmission flow of power in western states  as a large percentage of current power generation in the western grid comes from coal sources 
the power generation industry continues to make improvements in emissions control  voluntarily and in response to regulatory mandates 
emissions from new coal fired plants are now a small fraction of those produced by power plants built a generation ago 
with similar technological progress  coal can and likely will remain an important  domestically available  and economical national energy resource that is vital to meet growing energy demand 
in that regard  the united states department of energy is beginning to take positive steps toward ensuring the future of coal through research funding for clean coal technologies and methods of carbon capture and sequestration 
energy providers  government authorities and private interests continue to address issues concerning electric transmission  power generation capacity  the use of renewable and other diversified sources of energy  oil and natural gas pipelines and storage  and other infrastructure requirements 
in the short term  prevailing economic conditions will reduce industrial and retail energy consumption 
despite public and private efforts to promote conservation and efficiency  however  the demand for energy is expected to increase steadily over the long term 
to meet this demand growth  the industry will need to provide capital  resources and innovation to serve customers cost effectively  and to achieve suitable returns on investment 
we believe that we are well positioned in this industry setting  and able to proceed with our key business objectives 
along with industry counterparts  we are preparing to address the challenges discussed in this overview  such as new environmental regulations and mandates  renewable portfolio standards  co related taxes or trading practices  credit market conditions  inflation  or other factors that may affect energy demand and supply 
in particular  we are sensitive to additional costs that can negatively affect our customers or our profitability 
to that end  we intend to work closely with regulators and industry leaders to assure that cost conscious proposals and solutions are carefully explored in public policy proceedings 
business strategy we are a customer focused integrated energy company 
our business is comprised of electric and natural gas utility operations  power generation  and fuel assets and services  including production and marketing operations for crude oil  natural gas and coal 
our focus on customers whether they are utility customers or non regulated generation  fuel or marketing customers provides opportunities to expand our businesses by constructing additional rate base assets to serve our utility customers and expand our non regulated energy holdings to provide additional products and services to our wholesale customers 
the diversity of our energy operations reduces reliance on any single business segment to achieve our strategic objectives 
it mitigates our overall corporate risk and enhances our ability to earn stronger returns for shareholders over the long term 
despite challenging conditions in the capital markets over the past year  we have sufficient liquidity and solid cash flows  and expect to have continued access to the capital markets as needed 
consequently  our financial foundation is sound and capable of supporting an expansion of operations in both the near and long term 
during  we focused on the continued integration of the five utility properties acquired from aquila in mid and the achievement of certain operating efficiencies made possible by the acquisition 
during the year  we consolidated compensation  performance management  employee benefits  payroll  field resource  and customer information systems and processes 
during  we expect to achieve additional operating efficiencies by consolidating accounting and information systems  along with systems and processes for procurement  inventory  outage management  utility engineering  power marketing  resource planning and other areas 
our long term strategy focuses on growing both our utility and non regulated energy businesses  primarily by increasing our customer base and providing superior service to both utility and non regulated energy customers 
in our natural gas and electric utilities  we intend to grow our asset base to serve projected customer demand in our existing utility service territories through expansion of infrastructure and construction of new rate based power generation facilities 
we also plan to pursue acquisitions of additional utility properties  primarily in the great plains and rocky mountain regions of the country 
by maintaining our high customer service and reliability standards in a cost efficient manner  our goal is to secure appropriate rate recovery to provide solid economic returns on our utility investments 
in our fuel production operations  we will continue to prudently grow and develop our existing inventory of oil and gas reserves  while we strive to maintain strong relationships with mineral owners  landowners and regulatory authorities 
our ability to grow both production and reserves may be hindered in the short term by low price levels for both crude oil and natural gas resulting from the impact on demand from a weakened economy 
in the long term  however  we believe that demand for both natural gas and crude oil will be strong 
given increased regulatory emphasis on wind and solar power generation  and potential greenhouse gas legislation that may limit construction of new coal fired power plants  natural gas will be the fuel of choice for power generation 
additional gas fired peaking resources will also be required to provide back up supply for renewable technologies 
we will continue efforts to develop additional markets for our coal production  including the development of additional power plants at our mine site 
nearly of all electricity generated in the united states is currently supplied from coal fired plants 
it will take decades and significant expense before this generation can be replaced with alternative technologies 
as a result  coal fired resources will remain a necessary component of the nation s electric supply for the foreseeable future 
potential greenhouse gas legislation may limit construction of new conventional coal fired power plants  but technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration should provide for the long term economic use of coal 
we are investigating the possible deployment of these technologies at our mine site in wyoming 
we divested of seven ipp plants in because we were able to capture significant value for shareholders  but we have not exited the non regulated power generation business 
we have expertise in permitting  constructing and operating power generation facilities 
these skills  combined with our understanding of electric resource planning and regulatory procedures  provide a significant opportunity for us to add long term shareholder value 
we intend to grow our non regulated power generation business by continuing to focus on long term contractual relationships with other load serving utilities 
this was exemplified with the september announcement that our non regulated generation subsidiary was selected as the successful bidder to build mws of combined cycle gas fired power generation to provide energy and capacity to our colorado electric subsidiary  through a year power purchase agreement 
the expertise of our energy marketing business should provide continued long term profitability through a risk managed and disciplined approach to producer services  origination  storage  transportation and proprietary marketing strategies 
we will also continue to utilize our marketing expertise to enhance the value of our other energy assets  particularly our fuel and power generation assets 
we operate our lines of business as utilities and non regulated energy groups 
the utilities group consists of regulated electric and natural gas utility assets and services 
the non regulated energy group consists of fuel production  mid stream assets  power generation facilities and energy marketing 
the following are key elements of our business strategy complete the integration of the five utility properties acquired in the july aquila transaction  focusing on the achievement of operating efficiencies and cost reductions  provide stable long term rates for customers and increase earnings by efficiently planning  constructing and operating rate base power generation facilities needed to serve our electric utilities  proactively integrate alternative and renewable energy into our utility energy supply while mitigating and remaining mindful of customer rate impacts  expand utility operations through selective acquisitions of electric and gas utilities consistent with our regional focus and strategic advantages  build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale power customers of both our utilities and non regulated power generation businesses  selectively grow our non regulated power generation business in targeted regional markets by developing assets and selling most of the capacity and energy production through mid and long term contracts primarily to load serving utilities  exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to produce and sell power at attractive margins  grow our reserves and increase our production of natural gas and crude oil in a cost effective manner  opportunistically expand our energy marketing operations including producer and end use origination services and  as warranted by market conditions  natural gas and crude oil storage and transportation opportunities  diligently manage the credit  price and operational risks inherent in buying and selling energy commodities  and maintain an investment grade credit rating and ready access to debt and equity capital markets 
complete the integration of the five utility properties acquired in the aquila transaction  focusing on the achievement of operating efficiencies and cost reductions 
the july  acquisition of five utility properties in four states from aquila significantly expanded our regional presence and the size and scope of our utility operations 
the expanded utility operations enhanced our ability to serve customers and communities  and to build long term value for our shareholders 
as we have during  we will continue to work diligently in to complete the integration of operating system consolidations and establish more efficient processes so that we have a unified scalable platform ready for additional growth 
by standardizing processes  centralizing purchasing and inventory  and utilizing common computer systems and processes for customer service  accounting  human resources and operations  it will be possible to reduce costs and improve our operating efficiency 
provide stable long term rates for customers and increase earnings by efficiently planning  constructing and operating rate base power generation facilities needed to serve our electric utilities 
our company began as a vertically integrated electric utility  and this business model remains a core strength and strategy today  as we invest in and operate efficient power generation resources to cost effectively transmit and distribute electricity to our customers 
we provide power at reasonable and stable rates to our customers  and earn competitive returns for our investors 
rate based generation assets offer several advantages for consumers  regulators and investors 
first  since the generating assets are included in the utility rate base and reviewed and approved by government authorities  customer rates are more stable than if the power was purchased from the open market through wholesale contracts that are renegotiated over time 
second  regulators participate in a planning process where long term investments are designed to match long term energy demand 
third  investors are assured that a long term  reasonable  stable rate of return may be earned on their investment 
a lower risk profile may also improve credit ratings which  in turn  can benefit both consumers and investors by lowering our cost of capital 
examples of our progress include the january completion of wygen ii to serve the customers of cheyenne light and the ongoing construction of wygen iii  projected to be completed in april  to serve the customers of black hills power 
during  our colorado electric subsidiary completed a comprehensive resource planning process  through which we received approval to construct two gas fired power plants representing approximately mw  as rate base assets to serve the customers of colorado electric 
the projected commercial operation date for the plants is january  proactively integrate alternative and renewable energy into our utility energy supply while mitigating and remaining mindful of customer rate impacts 
the energy and utility industries face tremendous uncertainty related to the potential impact of legislation intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the use of renewable and other alternative energy sources 
to date  many states have enacted and others are considering some form of mandatory renewable energy standard  requiring utilities to meet certain thresholds of renewable energy use 
additionally  many states have either enacted or are considering legislation setting greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets 
federal legislation for both renewable energy standards and greenhouse gas emission reductions is also under consideration 
mandates for the use of renewable energy or the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will likely produce substantial increases in the prices for electricity and natural gas 
at the same time  however  as a regulated utility we are responsible for providing safe  reasonably priced  reliable sources of energy to our customers 
as a result  we have developed a customer centered strategy for renewable energy standards and greenhouse gas emission reductions that balances our customers rate concerns with environmental considerations 
we attempt to strike this balance by prudently and proactively incorporating renewable energy into our resource supply  while seeking to minimize the magnitude and frequency of rate increases for our utility customers 
examples of our balanced approach include in states such as south dakota and wyoming that currently have no legislative mandate on the use of renewable energy  we have proactively integrated cost effective renewable energy into our generation supply based upon our expectation that there will be mandatory renewable energy standards in the future 
for example  under two year ppas we purchase a total of mw of wind energy from wind farms located near cheyenne  wyoming for use at black hills power and cheyenne light  colorado and montana have legislative mandates regarding the use of renewable energy  therefore we aggressively pursue cost effective initiatives with the regulators that will allow us to meet our renewable energy requirements 
in colorado for instance  we filed an electric resource plan that includes enough renewable energy additions and greenhouse gas emission reductions to permit us to satisfy both i the state s requirement that of a utility s distributed energy must be supplied by renewable energy resources by  and ii the governor s executive order that requires a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by  and in all states in which we conduct electric utility operations  we are exploring other potential biomass  solar and wind energy projects and evaluating other potential wind generator sites  particularly sites located near our utility service territories 
using reasonable assumptions  we have also carefully evaluated our coal fired generating facilities and the potential future economic impact of a carbon tax or cap and trade regime intended to reduce co emissions 
for customers in states without renewable or co mandates  such as south dakota and wyoming  we believe it is in our utility customers long term interest to construct new mine mouth  coal fired generating facilities  such as our wygen ii generation facility completed in january and our wygen iii generation facility expected to be completed on april  
constructing these state of the art  cost efficient  coal fired facilities allows us to plan for the future retirement of older  less efficient plants with higher emissions and keep rates reasonable for customers 
in addition  we are actively evaluating alternative coal fired generation technologies  including igcc and carbon capture and sequestration  though both appear cost prohibitive in the near term 
these technologies may become cost effective in the future if the cost of co emissions reaches sufficiently high levels or further technological advancements reduce the costs of those technologies 
the location of our coal mine and power plant complex in the powder river basin of wyoming provides key strategic advantages for carbon capture and sequestration projects  such as readily available saline aquifers for the injection and sequestration of co  as well as a potential co market for use in enhanced oil recovery projects 
additionally  over the past two years  the wyoming legislature has been proactive in passing legislation to address pore space ownership  injection regulations and other legal issues associated with the underground sequestration of co expand utility operations through selective acquisitions of electric and gas utilities consistent with our regional focus and strategic advantages 
for nearly years we have provided reliable utility services  delivering quality and value to our customers 
our tradition of accomplishment supports efforts to expand our utility operations into other markets  most likely in areas that permit us to take advantage of our intrinsic competitive advantages  such as baseload power generation  system reliability  superior customer service  community involvement and a relationship based approach to regulatory matters 
the acquisition of cheyenne light and the aquila transaction are examples of such expansion efforts 
utility operations also enhance other important business development  including gas transmission pipelines and storage infrastructure  which could promote other non regulated energy operations 
utility operations can contribute substantially to the stability of our long term cash flows  earnings and dividend policy 
although we do not expect to make any significant utility acquisitions in  some industry experts believe that the current financial turmoil and economic recession may produce opportunities for healthy utility companies to acquire utility assets and operations of less creditworthy companies upon attractive terms and conditions 
we would expect to consider such opportunities if we believe they would further our long term strategy and help maximize shareholder value 
build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale power customers of both our utilities and non regulated power generation business 
we strive to build strong relationships with other utilities  municipalities and wholesale customers and believe we will continue to be a primary provider of electricity to wholesale utility customers 
we further believe that these entities will need products  such as capacity  in order to reliably serve their customers 
by providing these products under long term contracts  we are able to help our customers meet their energy needs 
through this approach  we also believe we can earn more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term than we could by selling energy into more volatile spot markets 
in addition  relationships that we ve established with wholesale power customers have developed into other opportunities 
mean and mdu  both wholesale power customers  are now also joint owners in two of our power plants 
selectively grow our non regulated power generation business in targeted western markets by developing assets and selling most of the capacity and energy production through mid and long term contracts primarily to load serving utilities 
in late  we initiated an evaluation of the merits of divesting certain power generation assets 
that strategic review resulted in the mid divestiture of seven ipp plants for a total of million 
while much of our recent power plant development has been for our regulated utilities  we intend to continue to expand our non regulated power generation business by developing and operating power plants in regional markets based on prevailing supply and demand fundamentals in a manner that complements our existing fuel assets and marketing capabilities 
we intend to grow this business through a combination of the development of new power generation facilities and disciplined acquisitions primarily in the western region where our detailed knowledge of market and electric transmission fundamentals provides us a competitive advantage  and  consequently increases our ability to earn attractive returns 
we expect to prioritize small scale facilities that serve incremental growth  and are typically easier to permit and construct than large scale generation projects 
most of the energy and capacity from our non regulated power facilities is sold under mid and long term contracts 
when possible  we structure long term contracts as tolling arrangements  whereby the contract counterparty assumes the fuel risk 
going forward  we will continue to focus on selling a majority of our non regulated capacity and energy primarily to load serving utilities under long term agreements that have been reviewed or approved by state utility commissions 
an example of this strategy is the mw of combined cycle gas fired generation being constructed to serve our colorado electric subsidiary beginning january   under a year tolling agreement 
with respect to our current power sale agreements  two of our long term power contracts provide for the sale of capacity and energy to cheyenne light from our gillette ct and wygen i plants 
the gillette ct contract expires in  and as part of our integrated resource planning efforts  the company is evaluating a potential extension of the contract 
the wygen i contract was extended during and now expires in exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to produce and sell power at attractive margins 
we expect to selectively expand our portfolio of power plants which have relatively low marginal costs of producing energy and related products and services 
we intend to utilize a competitive power production strategy  together with access to coal and natural gas reserves  to be competitive as a power generator 
competitive production costs can result from a variety of factors  including low fuel costs  efficiency in converting fuel into energy  and low per unit operation and maintenance costs 
in addition  we typically operate our plants with high levels of availability  as compared to industry benchmarks 
we aggressively manage each of these factors with the goal of achieving low production costs 
one of our primary competitive advantages is our wrdc coal mine  which is located in reasonably close proximity to our electric utility service territories 
we leverage this competitive advantage by building additional state of the art mine mouth coal fired generating capacity  which allows us to substantially eliminate fuel transportation and storage costs 
this strengthens our position as a low cost producer because transportation costs often represent the largest component of the delivered cost of coal for many other utilities 
grow our reserves and increase our production of natural gas and crude oil in a cost effective manner 
our strategy is to cost effectively grow our reserves and increase our production of natural gas and crude oil through both organic growth and acquisitions 
while consistent growth remains our objective  we realize the necessity of managing for value over managing for growth and intend to be appropriately responsive to market conditions 
growth in our core areas in the rocky mountain region is a focus that we must balance with opportunities in plays or basins which are new to us 
in the short term  growth plans are negatively impacted by the current economic crisis  and low natural gas and crude oil prices 
over the long term  however  we believe that demand will lead to higher product prices and opportunity for growth 
specifically  we plan to primarily focus on lower risk development and exploratory drilling  preferably where we can serve as the operator  participate on a non operated basis with other operators to gain exposure to additional plays and producing basins  focus on various plays in the rocky mountain region  where we can more easily integrate with our existing oil and natural gas operations as well as our fuel marketing and or power generation activities  support the future capital requirements of our drilling program by stabilizing cash flows with a hedging program that mitigates commodity price risk for a substantial portion of our established production for up to two years in the future  and enhance our oil and gas production activities with the construction or acquisition of mid stream gathering  compression and treating facilities in a manner that maximizes the economic value of our operations 
opportunistically expand our energy marketing operations including producer and end use origination services and  as warranted by market conditions  natural gas and crude oil storage and transportation opportunities 
our energy marketing business seeks to provide services to producers and end users of natural gas and crude oil and to capitalize on market volatility by employing storage  transportation and proprietary trading strategies 
the service provider focus of our energy marketing activities largely differentiates us from other energy marketers 
through our producer services group  we assist mostly small to medium sized independent producers throughout the western united states with marketing and transporting their crude oil and natural gas 
through our origination services  we work with utilities  municipalities and industrial users of natural gas to provide customized delivery services  as well as to support their efforts to optimize their transportation and storage positions 
diligently manage the credit  price and operational risks inherent in buying and selling energy commodities 
all of our operations require effective management of counterparty credit risk 
we mitigate this risk by conducting business with a diverse group of creditworthy counterparties 
in certain cases where creditworthiness merits security  we require prepayment  secured letters of credit or other forms of financial collateral 
we establish counterparty credit limits and employ continuous credit monitoring  with regular review of compliance under our credit policy by our executive credit committee 
our oil and gas  power generation and energy marketing operations require effective management of price and operational risks related to adverse changes in commodity prices and the volatility and liquidity of the commodity markets 
to mitigate these risks  we implemented risk management policies and procedures  particularly for our marketing operations 
our oversight committees monitor compliance with these policies 
we also limit exposure to energy marketing risks by maintaining a credit facility separate from our corporate credit facility 
we experienced very limited counterparty credit losses in despite the economic turmoil 
maintain an investment grade credit rating and ready access to debt and equity capital markets 
access to capital will be critical to our future success 
we will require access to the capital markets to fund our planned capital investments or  when possible  to make strategic acquisitions that prudently grow our businesses 
our access to adequate and cost effective financing depends upon our ability to maintain our investment grade issuer credit rating 
in late and throughout  disruption in worldwide capital markets substantially reduced liquidity in the debt capital markets and caused significant write offs in the financial services sector  the re pricing of credit risk  and the failure of certain financial institutions 
despite actions of the united states government  these events contributed to a general economic decline that is materially and adversely impacting the broader financial and credit markets  and reducing the availability of debt and equity capital 
our acquisition of additional utility properties in  combined with the divestiture of seven ipp plants  reduced our overall corporate risk profile 
even so  our access to capital markets was impacted by the conditions described above  particularly during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of notwithstanding these adverse market conditions  in we completed several key financings on reasonable terms  including a million senior unsecured corporate bond offering  a million committed stand alone credit facility for our energy marketing subsidiary  a million first mortgage bond financing for black hills power  and a million project financing for our wygen i and gillette ct power plants 
prospective information we expect to generate long term growth through the expansion of integrated  balanced and diverse energy operations 
we recognize that sustained growth requires near continual capital deployment 
as capital market conditions improved in  we were able to complete three key long term debt financings and we are confident in our ability to obtain additional financing to continue our growth plans 
we will remain focused on managing our operations cautiously and maintaining our overall liquidity to meet our operating  capital and financing needs  as well as executing our long term strategic plan 
utilities group the utilities group successfully completed a full year of operations including those operations purchased in the aquila transaction 
post close integration activities are being executed so that our workforces and systems will be combined to establish a growth platform that delivers value to our shareholders 
during  the utilities group completed conversion to a single customer information system which unified our customer service and billing processes 
we continue to work to unify our performance management and compensation systems  outage management  inventory management and accounting systems 
we anticipate these process improvements will be completed in electric utilities business at black hills power remained relatively strong in we continue construction of the wygen iii power plant  which is planned for commercial operation by april black hills power owns of the facility with mdu purchasing a ownership interest in the facility in april beginning january   we benefited from an increase in transmission rates resulting from a ferc transmission rate case 
the rate structure also includes a formula approach to rates that allows us to recover our capital investment as the capital is placed in service on the related transmission infrastructure 
to accommodate both the load growth within the region and the addition of wygen iii  additional transmission infrastructure is planned over the next several years 
during  black hills power filed two rate cases 
one with the sdpuc and the other with wpsc  requesting an electric revenue increase to recover costs associated with wygen iii and other generation  transmission and distribution assets and increased operating expenses 
a million  or approximately  increase in annual utility revenues was requested in south dakota and the new rates are expected to be in effect on or around april  the request for our wyoming customers is a million  or approximately  increase in annual utility revenues and new rates are anticipated to be effective on or around july   although recovery could be delayed until august as part of the regulatory process 
the proposed rate increases are subject to approval by the applicable state commissions 
we are focused on colorado electric s energy resource plan and during  colorado electric received approval from the cpuc to build power generation facilities representing approximately mw 
these generation facilities are part of a plan to replace the capacity and energy supplied under a ppa with psco that currently supplies approximately of colorado electric s annual energy and capacity needs and expires at the end of the addition of these plants to our utility rate base will have a significant positive impact on our financial results 
we filed a normal rate case for colorado electric in january to recover increased costs and investments made since the last rate case was filed and plan a future filing pertinent to the new generation and transmission assets as they are ready to begin serving customers 
the remaining capacity and energy needed for colorado electric was acquired through a competitive bidding process including other power producers 
our power generation segment participated in this bidding process  and in september  our power generation segment was awarded the bid to provide mw of capacity and energy to colorado electric through a year ppa 
gas utilities our regulated gas utilities are focused on the continued investment in our gas distribution network and related technology such as automated meter reading and mobile data terminals 
as further described in our utilities group regulation and rates discussion within items and business and properties of this annual report on form k  we received approval for rate increases and specific cost recoveries for iowa gas  colorado gas and kansas gas in we also filed a rate request for nebraska gas of million to be effective subject to refund on march  as part of the kcc approval of the aquila transaction  the kcc implemented a moratorium on filing for a general rate increase until for kansas gas 
we continually monitor our investments and costs of operations in all states to determine when additional rate case or other rate filings will be necessary 
non regulated energy group power generation during january  we completed the sale of a interest in wygen i to mean for million 
we recognized a gain on the sale of approximately million after tax 
concurrently with this sale  we also terminated a year power purchase contract under which mean was obligated to buy mw of power and capacity from wygen i 
the decreased revenues associated with the terminated agreement will be partially replaced by agreements under which mean will pay for costs associated with administrative services  plant operations  site leases and coal supplied by our coal mining operation 
our power generation segment was awarded the bid to provide mw of power to our colorado electric subsidiary through a year ppa 
the mw natural gas fired electric generation facilities will be built in colorado and are expected to be completed by the end of we plan to continue evaluating opportunities to bid on the construction of generation resources  both new and existing  for other regional electric utilities for their energy and capacity needs 
coal mining production from the coal mining segment primarily serves mine mouth generation plants and select regional customers with long term fuel needs 
increased demand will come from additional mine mouth generation either currently being constructed or in various stages of development 
total annual production is estimated to be approximately million tons in oil and gas during  we limited our development capital due to low oil and gas prices 
although we are focused on growing our oil and gas production through development of existing acreage and limited acquisitions depending on economic and industry conditions  our decision to shut in production at properties with the highest operating costs and limit development capital due to low prices will continue into during  we expect to limit our development capital to no more than the cash flows produced by our oil and gas properties 
the current economic conditions will be particularly challenging since low commodity prices make many of our development drilling sites uneconomical  which could further reduce our development capital expenditures 
the lower development capital expenditures will lead to lower production levels due to the natural production decline of existing wells 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a million after tax ceiling test impairment charge to our oil and gas properties 
for reporting periods ending on or after december   the sec adopted new reporting and accounting requirements for oil and gas companies which changed the way we test for partial ceiling test impairments 
key revisions include changes to the pricing used to determine reserves to a month average price 
this change does not alleviate the potential for future impairments  but currently none are anticipated 
energy marketing we have a strong marketing portfolio with a significant amount of optionality that can provide opportunities to create economic value over the next several years 
while we expect to derive earnings from these contracts over many years  the required methods of accounting for these transactions could result in additional earnings volatility during the term of these contracts 
our earnings were negatively impacted as market conditions prevented us from replacing the positive mark to market value of contracts that settled during the year 
during and continuing into  there was a significant contraction in the availability of capital 
despite these challenges  we entered into an agreement for a committed enserco credit facility on may  impacting results in  was our decision beginning in late and continuing into mid to conduct our enserco business operation in a manner to preserve overall liquidity  which included minimizing utilization of the existing non committed enserco credit facility until the new committed facility was finalized 
this constraint on capital restricted enserco s ability to take advantage of favorable transactions that might have been available in the marketplace in the first half of the credit facility relieves these constraints for enserco s operations in corporate during  we completed several long term financings including a million senior unsecured bond offering which was used along with the corporate credit facility to repay the acquisition facility  a million first mortgage bond issuance at black hills power  a million project financing at black hills wyoming  and refinancing of two industrial development revenue bonds at cheyenne light 
we continue to work toward integration and unification of our processes and systems 
in  we completed conversion of our customer information system  implemented new performance management and compensation programs  commenced unification of our employee benefits  and continued efforts on converting our financial  outage management  utility engineering  procurement and inventory  and work management systems 
as of december   we had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million  which do not currently qualify for hedge accounting treatment provided by accounting standards for derivatives and hedges 
accordingly  all mark to market adjustments on these swaps are recorded through the income statement 
as of december   the mark to market value of these swaps was a liability of million 
in  we recorded an unrealized mark to market after tax gain of million on these swaps 
fluctuations in interest rates create volatility in the fair value of these swaps which will likely have an impact on our earnings as we record the associated unrealized mark to market gains or losses within our income statement 
these swaps are for terms of nine and nineteen years and have amended mandatory early termination dates ranging from december  to december  we have continued to maintain these swaps in anticipation of our upcoming financing needs  particularly as they relate to our planned capital requirements to build gas fired power generation facilities to serve our colorado electric customers  and because of our upcoming holding company debt maturities  which are million and million in years and  respectively 
alternatively  we may choose to cash settle these swaps at their fair value prior to their mandatory early termination dates  or unless these dates are extended  we will cash settle these swaps for an amount equal to their fair value on the termination dates

the utilities group income from continuing operations increased million in compared to results include the earnings from the operations of the five utilities acquired in the aquila transaction subsequent to the july  acquisition date 
earnings from continuing operations from the regulated electric utilities increased million primarily due to an increase in retail rates and increased electricity sold to retail customers 
earnings from continuing operations from the regulated gas utilities were million for the period july  through december  the non regulated energy group s loss from continuing operations was million in  compared to earnings of million in  primarily due to a million after tax ceiling test impairment at the oil and gas segment and lower earnings from energy marketing of million 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in power generation earnings of million  which includes the impact of increased earnings from investment partnerships and lower indirect corporate costs related to the ipp transaction

utilities group regulated electric utilities operating results for the years ended december  for the regulated electric utilities are as follows in thousands revenue electric revenue gas total revenue fuel and purchased power electric purchased gas total fuel and purchased power gross margin electric gross margin gas total gross margin operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other income income tax expense income from continuing operations and net income results include the operations of colorado electric acquired on july  regulated power plant fleet availability coal fired plants other plants total availability compared to results include a full year of operations at colorado electric  which was acquired on july  income from continuing operations was million after tax in compared to million after tax in primarily due to a million decrease in margins from off system sales reflecting the lower margins available in the current low energy price environment  and a million increase in net interest expense primarily due to additional debt associated with the acquisition of colorado electric  additional long term project debt at black hills power  and inter segment debt restructuring at colorado electric  partially offset by afudc borrowed 
partially offsetting these were a million increase in other margins primarily due to an increase in transmission rates effective january  at black hills power  and increased other income primarily due to an increase in afudc equity of million from the construction of wygen iii in compared to results include a partial year of operations at colorado electric  which was acquired on july  income from continuing operations was million after tax in compared to million after tax in  primarily due to an increase in earnings of approximately million primarily due to the impact of a rate increase at cheyenne light effective january   and a increase in electric mwh sales to retail customers  primarily due to the acquisition of colorado electric 
partially offsetting these were increased plant maintenance costs and depreciation expense of approximately million associated with the wygen ii plant placed into service january   and lower afudc compared to regulated gas utilities operating results for the years ended december  for the regulated gas utilities are as follows in thousands for the period july  to december  revenue natural gas regulated other non regulated total sales cost of sales natural gas regulated other non regulated total cost of sales gross margin natural gas regulated other non regulated total gross margin operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other expense income tax expense income from continuing operations and net income the regulated gas utilities located in colorado  nebraska  iowa and kansas were acquired on july  income from continuing operations was million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to a full year of regulated gas utilities operation in compared to the partial year in natural gas demand is typically higher in the first and fourth quarters as gas is used for residential and commercial heating 
the regulated gas utilities have gcas that allow them to pass through the cost of gas to customers 
for this reason  we believe gross margins are a more useful performance measure than revenues as fluctuations in the cost of gas are passed through to revenues 
in addition to a full year of operations at the gas utilities  results were impacted by favorable weather as well as rate increases from general rate cases in colorado million annual increase effective april   general rate cases in iowa million annual increase effective july   and from cost tracking riders in kansas million annual increase effective september  
non regulated energy group oil and gas oil and gas operating results were as follows in thousands revenue operating expenses a impairment of long lived assets operating loss income interest expense  net other income income tax benefit expense income loss from continuing operations and net income a operating expenses included a million and million ceiling test impairment charge in and  respectively

the rate was particularly impacted by a lower asset base as a result of previous asset impairment charges 
this impact was partially offset by persistent low product prices during the year  which resulted in lower oil and gas reserve quantities

the following is a summary of our proved oil and gas reserves at december bbls of oil in thousands mmcf of natural gas total mmcfe reserves are based on reports prepared by an independent consulting and engineering firm 
the reports were prepared by cawley  gillespie associates  inc  an independent engineering company 
reserves were determined using sec defined product prices 
such reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and may be subject to revisions as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
the current estimate takes into account production of approximately bcfe  additions from extensions  discoveries and acquisitions of bcfe and negative revisions to previous estimates of bcfe  including approximately bcfe due to lower product prices 
reserves reflect sec defined pricing held constant for the life of the reserves  as follows oil gas oil gas oil gas nymex prices well head reserve prices on december   the sec issued final rules amending its oil and gas reserve reporting requirements effective for years ending on or after december  the final rule changed the use of prices at the end of each reporting period to an average of the first day of the month for the preceding twelve months held constant for the life of production 
previously  the rule required the use of the spot price on the last day of the reporting period  held constant for the life of production 
compared to loss from continuing operations was million after tax compared to a loss of million after tax in the prior year  primarily due to a million after tax non cash ceiling test impairment charge was taken during the first quarter of the write down in the net carrying value of our natural gas and crude oil properties resulted from low march  quarter end natural gas prices for the commodities 
the write down of gas and oil properties was based on period end nymex prices of per mcf  adjusted to per mcf at the wellhead  for natural gas and per barrel  adjusted to per barrel at the wellhead  for crude oil 
this compares to a million after tax non cash ceiling test impairment charge taken during the fourth quarter the write down in value of our natural gas and crude oil properties in resulted from low year end prices for the commodities 
the write down of gas and oil properties was based on year end nymex prices of per mcf  adjusted to per mcf at the wellhead  for natural gas and per barrel  adjusted to per barrel at the wellhead  for crude oil  loe decreased million due to lower production and cost reduction efforts  lower depletion expense of million primarily due to reduced depletion rate caused by a lower asset base as a result of previous asset impairment charges and lower production  decreased production taxes of approximately million primarily due to lower oil and natural gas prices  and a million income tax benefit related to an adjustment of a previously recorded tax position 
partially offsetting these were decreased revenues of million primarily due to a and decrease in the annual average hedged price of oil and gas received  respectively  and a and decrease in oil and gas production  respectively 
the decrease in natural gas production is due to a lower level of capital spending than in prior years and a voluntary shut in of production at properties with the highest operating costs 
shut ins reduced production for the year ended december  by approximately mmcfe 
compared to loss from continuing operations was million after tax compared to income from continuing operations of million after tax in the prior year  primarily due to a million after tax non cash ceiling test impairment charge was taken during the fourth quarter the write down in the net carrying value of our natural gas and crude oil properties resulted from low year end prices for the commodities 
the write down of gas and oil properties was based on year end nymex prices of per mcf  adjusted to per mcf at the wellhead  for natural gas and per barrel  adjusted to per barrel at the wellhead  for crude oil  loe increased million due to costs related to severe weather conditions in new mexico  increased fuel costs and higher industry related costs  and increased depletion expense of million primarily due to negative reserve revisions driven by the impact of lower year end commodity prices 
partially offsetting these was increased revenues of million primarily due to a increase in the annual average hedged price of oil received and a increase in the annual average hedged price of gas received  partially offset by a decrease in production and the impact of a royalty settlement with the jicarilla apache nation 
the decrease in production resulted from severe weather at the beginning of  federal drilling permit delays  voluntary shut in of volumes in response to low price levels at the cig pricing location and delays in drilling activity on our non operated property as well as a reduction in capital spending due to the low commodity prices

power generation our power generation segment produced the following results in thousands revenue gain on sale of operating asset operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other income expense income tax expense benefit income loss from continuing operations the following table provides certain operating statistics for the power generation segment at december  independent power capacity mw of independent power capacity in service contracted fleet plant availability gas fired plants coal fired plants total compared to income from continuing operations was million after tax in compared to million after tax in the increase of million was primarily due to a million gain on the sale of a ownership interest in the wygen i power generation facility  operating expenses reflect million of allocated indirect costs relating to the ipp assets sold not reclassified to discontinued operations in accordance with accounting guidance for discontinued operations  and interest expense in includes million of allocated net interest expense relating to the ipp assets sold not reclassified to discontinued operations in accordance with accounting guidance for discontinued operations partially offset in by an increase in interest expense of million primarily due to a change in intersegment debt to equity capital structure 
partially offsetting these were a decrease of million reflecting net earnings impact of replacing a mw ppa with operating and site lease agreements related to mean s purchase of a ownership interest in wygen i  and a million gain on the sale of excess emission credits in  which were made available by the decommissioning of the ontario facility 
compared to income from continuing operations was million after tax in compared to a loss from continuing operations of million in the increase of million was primarily due to increased earnings from our investments due to partnership impairment charges of million for the glenns ferry and rupert power plants  in which we hold a ownership interest  increased operating income from our gillette ct of million after tax 
operating income was impacted by lower gas and purchased power costs and maintenance expense  allocated indirect corporate costs  related to the ipp assets sold and not reclassified to discontinued operations decreased million after tax 
costs represent a partial year through the sale date of the ipp transaction  compared to a full months of costs in  and the recording of an impairment loss  and related costs  in of million relating to the ontario plant 
partially offsetting the increased earnings was a decrease in non operating income of million after tax  resulting from a change in business segment debt to equity capital structure 
coal mining coal mining results were as follows in thousands revenue operating expenses operating income interest income  net other income income tax expense income from continuing operations the following table provides certain operating statistics for the coal mining segment in thousands tons of coal sold cubic yards of overburden moved coal reserves compared to income from continuing operations was million after tax in compared to million after tax in the increase of million was due to a million increase in revenues primarily due to a higher average price received  partially offset by lower coal volumes sold 
the higher average price received includes the impact of sales prices to our regulated utility subsidiaries that are determined in part by a return on investment base  and a million increase in other income primarily from a site lease agreement recently entered into with the owners of wygen iii  which is located on mine property 
the agreement provided for a march start date reflecting the commencement of construction on wygen iii 
partially offsetting these was a million increase in operating costs primarily due to higher depreciation from an increased asset base and higher usage levels related to increased production  partially offset by lower estimated future reclamation costs 
compared to income from continuing operations was million after tax in compared to million after tax in the decrease of million was due to increased overburden removal costs of million due to a increase in overburden yards moved  compounded by a higher strip ratio  longer haul distances and higher diesel fuel costs  and increased depreciation expense of million due to an increase in the asset base and usage related to increased production 
offsetting the decreases was a million increase in revenues due to a increase in coal sold at a higher average price 
the increase in coal volumes was due to additional wygen ii and train load out sales

critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in application 
there are also areas which require management s judgment in selecting among available gaap alternatives 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from our estimates and to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 
the following discussion of our critical accounting estimates should be read in conjunction with note  business description and summary of significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate for impairment  the carrying values of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  whenever indicators of impairment exist and at least annually for goodwill as required by accounting standards for goodwill 
for long lived assets with finite lives  this evaluation is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the anticipated future cash flows over the expected useful life of the assets is less than the assets carrying value  then a permanent non cash write down equal to the difference between the assets carrying value and the assets fair value is required to be charged to earnings 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use a probability weighted average expected cash flow method with assumptions based on those used for internal budgets 
the determination of future cash flows  and  if required  fair value of a long lived asset is by its nature a highly subjective judgment 
significant assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the long term estimated cash flows 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the evaluation of our long lived assets 
according to accounting standards for goodwill  goodwill and other intangibles are required to be evaluated whenever indicators of impairment exist and at least annually 
we conduct our annual evaluations during the fourth quarter 
the standard requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
the first step of this test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of the impairment 
the underlying assumptions used for determining fair value are susceptible to change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions about future revenues and operating costs  the amount and timing of anticipated capital expenditures for power generating facilities  discount rates  inflation rates  and economic conditions  require significant judgment 
we have million in goodwill as of december   of which million relates to our black hills energy utilities 
colorado electric holds and the gas utilities hold of the black hills energy goodwill 
for the colorado electric impairment analysis  we estimate the fair value of the goodwill using a discounted cash flows methodology 
this analysis required the input of several critical assumptions in building our risk adjusted discount rate and cash flow projections including future growth rates  operating cost escalation rates  timing and level of success in regulatory rate proceedings  and the cost of debt and equity capital 
we believe the goodwill amount reflects the value of the opportunity to build a significant amount of rate based generation and transmission in the next two years followed by the relatively stable  long lived cash flows of the regulated utility business  considering the regulatory environment and market growth potential 
the results of the analysis show colorado electric with a carrying value of million as of november   compared to a fair value of million 
the fair value exceeds the carrying value by  therefore we do not have an impairment 
the remaining million of goodwill relates to the gas utilities 
we tested this goodwill for impairment using an ebitda multiple method and a discounted cash flow method at each reporting unit 
the analysis required the input of several critical assumptions in determining ebitda  the multiple to apply to ebitda  cash flow projections and risk adjusted discount rate 
these assumptions include future growth rates  operating cost escalation rates  timing and level of success in regulatory rate proceedings  and long term earnings and merger multiples for comparable companies 
the results of the analysis show the gas utilities with a carrying value of million as of november   compared to a fair value of million 
the fair value exceeds the carrying value by  therefore we do not have an impairment 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
we account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method whereby all productive and nonproductive costs related to acquisition  exploration and development drilling activities are capitalized 
these costs are amortized using a unit of production method based on volumes produced and proved reserves 
any conveyances of properties  including gains or losses on abandonments of properties  are treated as adjustments to the cost of the properties with no gain or loss recognized 
net capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
this method values the reserves based upon sec defined prices for oil and gas as of the end of each reporting period adjusted for contracted price changes 
the prices  as well as costs and development capital  are assumed to remain constant for the remaining life of the properties 
if the net capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  then a permanent non cash write down is required to be charged to earnings in that reporting period 
under these sec defined product prices  our net capitalized costs were more than the full cost ceiling at march  and december  requiring an after tax write down of million and million  respectively 
under the sec defined product prices at december   no additional write down was required 
given the fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices  we can provide no assurance that future write downs will not occur depending on oil and gas prices at that point in time 
on december   the sec issued final rules amending its oil and gas reporting requirements effective for fiscal years ending on or after december  and apply to the annual reports on form k 
the final rule changes the use of prices at the end of each reporting period to an average of the first day of the month price for the preceding twelve months 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves are based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
an independent petroleum engineering company prepares reports that estimate our proved oil and natural gas reserves annually 
the accuracy of any oil and natural gas reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as oil and gas prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves may also change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in estimating our oil and natural gas reserves  the estimates are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the unit of production method of calculating depletion expense  the amortization rate of our capitalized oil and gas properties incorporates the estimated unit of production attributable to the estimates of proved reserves 
the net book value of our oil and gas properties is also subject to a ceiling limitation based in large part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
risk management activities in addition to the information provided below  see note  risk management activities and note  fair value measurement  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
derivatives accounting standards for derivatives require the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and their measurement at fair value 
our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative 
the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings 
derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or fair values 
the effective portion of changes in fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss until it is reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in current earnings 
changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized in current earnings along with fair value changes of the underlying hedged item 
we currently use derivative instruments  including options  swaps  futures  forwards and other contractual commitments for both non trading hedging and trading purposes 
our typical non trading hedging transactions relate to contracts we enter into to fix the price received for anticipated future production at our oil and gas segment  or to fulfill the annual winter hedging plan for our regulated gas utilities see below  and for interest rate swaps we enter into to convert a portion of our variable rate debt  or associated variable rate interest payments  to a fixed rate 
our energy marketing operations utilize various physical and financial contracts to effectively manage our marketing and trading portfolios 
fair values of derivative instruments and energy trading contracts are based on actively quoted market prices or other external source pricing information  where possible 
if external market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors and pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recorded  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
changes in the commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future 
to the extent financial contracts have extended maturity dates  our estimates of fair value may involve greater subjectivity due to the lack of transparent market data available upon which to base modeling assumptions 
a change to the estimated fair value prices would have affected net income by approximately million 
as allowed by state regulatory commissions  we have entered into certain financial instruments to reduce our customers underlying exposure to fluctuations in gas prices 
these financial instruments are considered derivatives and are marked to market 
we apply the accounting standards for regulated operations to periodic changes in fair value of the derivatives associated with these instruments and record an offset in regulatory asset or regulatory liability accounts 
most of our contracts for purchase and sale of natural gas qualify for the normal purchase and normal sale exceptions under accounting standards for derivatives  and are not required to be recorded as derivative assets and liabilities 
counterparty credit risk and allowance for doubtful accounts our largest counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies 
this concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market  economic or regulatory conditions 
recent adverse developments in the global financial and credit markets have made it more difficult and more expensive for companies to access the short term bank markets  which may negatively impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and collateral requirements under certain circumstances  including the use of master netting agreements in our energy marketing segment 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
the allowances provided are estimated and may be impacted by economic  market and regulatory conditions  which could have an effect on future allowance requirements and significantly impact future results of operations 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and established provisions  we can provide no assurance that our actual credit losses will be consistent with our estimates 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  has three defined benefit pension plans and three defined post retirement healthcare plans 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions  the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  rate of future increases in compensation levels  and healthcare cost projections 
the determination of our obligation and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the assumptions used by actuaries in calculating the amounts 
in  we changed our measurement date to december although we believe our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
in july  the board of directors froze our defined benefit pension plans to certain new participants and transferred certain existing participants to an age and service based defined contribution plan  effective january  plan assets and obligations for the black hills corporation plan which covers eligible employees of black hills service company  black hills power  wrdc  and bhep  and the black hills utility holdings plan  which covers eligible employees of our black hills utility holding subsidiaries were revalued as of july  in conjunction with the curtailment of these plans 
as a result  we recognized a pre tax curtailment expense of approximately million in the third quarter of the cheyenne light plan recognized a pre tax curtailment expense of less than million and this expense was booked in the fourth quarter of in july  the board of directors also approved amendments to the bhc retiree healthcare plan and the black hills utility holdings plan effective january   from a cost sharing plan to a rmsa for non union employees and participating union employees and expand eligibility of plan participants 
the pension benefit cost for for our non contributory funded pension plan is expected to be million compared to million in the estimated discount rate used to determine annual benefit cost accruals will be in  the discount rate used in was 
in selecting the discount rate  we consider cash flow durations for each plan s liabilities and returns on high credit quality fixed income yield curves for comparable durations 
our pension plan assets are held in trust and primarily consist of equity  fixed income and real estate securities 
in  our target long term investment allocations were equity and fixed income 
at december   our investment allocation was equities  fixed income cash and real estate 
we do not pre fund our non qualified pension plans or two of the three postretirement benefit plans 
the table below shows the expected impacts of a increase or decrease to our discount rate assumption for our retiree healthcare plans in thousands change in assumed discount rate impact on december  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation impact on service and interest cost increase decrease contingencies when it is probable that an environmental or other legal liability has been incurred  a loss is recognized when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the probability and the amount of loss are made based on currently available facts 
accounting for contingencies requires significant judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to potential liability 
our assessment of our exposure to contingencies could change to the extent there are additional future developments  or as more information becomes available 
if actual obligations incurred are different from our estimates  the recognition of the actual amounts could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of deferred tax assets we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized  at currently enacted income tax rates  to reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax assets recognized is limited to the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and provides any necessary valuation allowances as required 
if we determine that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretations of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources overview information about our financial position as of december is presented in the following table dollars  in thousands financial position summary percentage change cash and cash equivalents restricted cash short term debt long term debt stockholders equity ratios long term debt ratio total debt ratio we believe that our cash on hand  operating cash flows  existing borrowing capacity and ability to complete new debt financings  taken as a whole  provide sufficient resources to fund our ongoing operating requirements  debt maturities  anticipated dividends  and anticipated capital expenditures during the next twelve months 
however  a material change in available financing including further changes resulting from a recurrence of the capital market disruptions experienced in and early could impact our ability to fund our current liquidity and capital resource requirements 
liquidity historically  our principal sources of short term liquidity have been our revolving credit facilities and cash from operations 
we have utilized availability under our revolving credit facilities to manage our cash flow needs  which are affected by the seasonality of our utility businesses and changes in the trading volumes of our energy marketing operation 
our principal sources of long term liquidity have been proceeds raised from public and private offerings of equity and long term debt securities issued by the company and its subsidiaries 
we have also managed liquidity needs through hedging activities  primarily in connection with seasonal needs of our utility operations including seasonal peaks in fuel requirements  interest rate movements  and commodity price movements 
at december   we had approximately million of unrestricted cash on hand and approximately million of additional capacity on our corporate credit facility available for additional borrowings or letters of credits 
we had the following cash borrowings and letters of credit outstanding under our credit facilities  as set forth below in millions credit facility expiration maximum capacity borrowings and letters of credit issued at december  corporate credit facility may  enserco facility may  credit facilities and long term debt corporate credit facility our unsecured revolving credit facility has a maximum capacity of million 
the cost of borrowing or letters of credit under our corporate revolver is determined based on our credit ratings 
at our current ratings levels  the facility has an annual facility fee of basis points  and has a borrowing spread of basis points over libor which equates to a one month borrowing rate as of december  
the revolver can be used to fund our working capital needs and for general corporate purposes 
at december   we had borrowings of million and million of letters of credit issued under the facility  and we had approximately million of capacity available for additional borrowings or letters of credit 
our revolving credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  such as limitations on the creation of new indebtedness and on certain liens  restrictions on certain transactions  and maintenance of the following financial covenants i a consolidated net worth in an amount of not less than the sum of million and of our aggregate consolidated net income beginning january   ii a recourse leverage ratio not to exceed to and  iii an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than to subject to applicable cure periods  a violation of any of these covenants would constitute an event of default that entitles the lenders to terminate their remaining commitments and accelerate all principal and interest outstanding 
at december   our consolidated net worth was  million  which was approximately million in excess of the net worth we were required to maintain under the credit facility 
at december   our long term debt ratio was  our total debt leverage long term debt and short term debt was  our recourse leverage ratio was approximately and our interest expense coverage ratio for the year ended december  was to accordingly  we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants in the revolving credit facility as of december  in addition to covenant violations  an event of default under the credit facility may be triggered by other events  such as a failure to make payments when due or a failure to make payments when due in respect of  or a failure to perform obligations relating to  other debt obligations of million or more 
subject to applicable cure periods none of which apply to a failure to timely pay indebtedness  an event of default would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the credit facility for loans or new letters of credit  and could require both the immediate repayment of any principal and interest outstanding and the cash collateralization of outstanding letter of credit obligations 
the credit facility prohibits us from paying cash dividends if a default or an event of default exists prior to  or would result after giving effect to such action 
enserco credit facility on may   enserco entered into an agreement for a million committed credit facility 
societe generale  fortis capital corp  and bnp paribas were co lead arranger banks 
on may   enserco entered into an agreement for an additional million of commitments under the credit facility with three participating banks credit agricole corporate and investment bank  rabobank and rzb finance 
the million credit facility expires on may  the facility is a borrowing base line of credit  the structure of which requires certain levels of net worth and net working capital to be maintained for a given borrowing base election level 
in order to maintain a borrowing base election level  we may be restricted from making dividend payments from enserco to the parent 
maximum borrowings under the facility are subject to a sublimit of million 
borrowings under this facility are available under a base rate option or a eurodollar option 
the base rate option borrowing rate is plus the higher of i above the federal funds rate  or ii the prime rate established by fortis bank sa nv the eurodollar option borrowing rate is plus the higher of the eurodollar rate or the reference bank cost of funds 
the facility structure requires certain levels of tangible net worth and net working capital to be maintained for a given borrowing base election level 
in order to maintain a borrowing base election level  we may be restricted from making dividend payments from enserco to the parent company 
at december   million of letters of credit were issued under this facility and there were no cash borrowings outstanding 
we expect to replace the corporate credit facility and the enserco credit facility with similar facilities prior to their maturities 
we expect to renew the corporate credit facility for a three year term at a to million total commitment level and the enserco credit facility for a one year term at a million level 
acquisition facility in july  in conjunction with the closing of the aquila transaction  we borrowed million under our billion bridge acquisition credit facility dated may  the acquisition facility was structured as a single draw term loan facility for the sole purpose of financing the aquila transaction 
during  we paid off the acquisition facility with proceeds of million from the sale of of the wygen iii plant to mdu  net proceeds from the million public debt offering of senior notes  and with borrowings of million on our corporate credit facility 
industrial development revenue bonds cheyenne light completed a million weekly variable rate refunding bond issuance on september  the new issue replaced existing debt and converted the bond credit support structure from an ambac financial group insurance policy to a direct pay letter of credit issued by wells fargo bank 
laramie county  wyoming was the tax exempt conduit issuer for this transaction 
the bonds were issued in two series a million series maturing march   and a million series maturing september  the principal amounts and maturity dates did not change from the original financing 
including the letter of credit fees and other issuance costs  the current all in rate as of december   was approximately 
under the terms of our reimbursement agreement with the letter of credit provider  cheyenne light is required to maintain a consolidated debt to capitalization ratio of no more than to and a consolidated interest coverage ratio greater than or equal to to 
if cheyenne light fails to meet these covenants  subject to a day cure period  it would constitute an event of default and the bank would have the right to cause the bonds and related outstanding obligations to become immediately due and payable 
cross default provisions our revolving credit facility contains cross default provisions that would result in an event of default under the credit facility upon i a failure by us or certain of our subsidiaries including  among others  enserco and most of our utility subsidiaries to timely pay indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of million or more  or ii the occurrence of a default under any agreement under which we or certain of our subsidiaries including  among others  enserco and most of our utility subsidiaries may incur indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of million or more  and such default continues for a period of time sufficient to permit an acceleration of the maturity of such indebtedness or a mandatory prepayment of such indebtedness 
in addition  our credit facility contains default provisions under which an event of default would result if we or certain of our subsidiaries including  among others  enserco and most of our utility subsidiaries fail to timely make certain payments  such as erisa funding obligations or payments in satisfaction of judgments  in an aggregate principal amount of million or more 
holding company debt offering in may  we issued a million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in pursuant to a public offering 
the notes were priced at par and carry a fixed interest rate of 
we received proceeds of million  net of underwriting fees 
proceeds were used to pay down a portion of the acquisition facility 
deferred financing costs related to the offering of million were capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the debt 
black hills power bond issuance in october  our regulated utility black hills power completed a million first mortgage bond issuance 
the bonds were priced at of par with a reoffer yield of 
the bonds mature on november   and carry an annual interest rate of  which will be paid semi annually 
we received proceeds of million net of underwriting fees  which were used to repay borrowings under the corporate credit facility 
deferred financing costs of million were capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the bonds 
black hills wyoming project financing on december   our subsidiary black hills wyoming issued million in project financing debt 
the debt is secured by our ownership interest in the wygen i facility and by the gillette ct generation facility 
the loan amortizes over a seven year term and matures on december   at which time the remaining balance of million is due 
principal and interest payments are made on a quarterly basis with the principal payments based on projected cash flows available for debt service 
interest is charged at libor plus at december  
proceeds were used to repay borrowings on the corporate credit facility 
estimated deferred financing costs of million were capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the debt 
black hills non regulated holdings  the parent of black hills wyoming  must maintain equity of million 
we were in compliance of this requirement at december our black hills wyoming project financing is secured by our ownership interest in the wygen i plant and by the gillette ct plant 
the financing places restrictions on dividends or the loaning of funds by black hills wyoming  and allows it only in limited circumstances when cash flows for the projects exceed project debt service and reserve requirements 
we had approximately million of equity at black hills wyoming as of december  interest rate swaps we have entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
we have interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million that are not designated as hedge instruments 
accordingly  mark to market changes in value on the swaps are recorded within the income statement 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million pre tax unrealized mark to market non cash gain on the swaps 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million pre tax unrealized mark to market non cash loss on the swaps 
the mark to market value on these swaps was a liability of million at december  subsequent mark to market adjustments could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
a one basis point move in the interest rate curves over the term of the swaps would have a pre tax impact of approximately million 
these swaps are for terms of nine and nineteen years and have amended mandatory early termination dates ranging from december  to december  we have continued to maintain these swaps in anticipation of our upcoming financing needs  particularly as they relate to our planned capital requirements to build gas fired power generation facilities to serve our colorado electric customers and our upcoming holding company debt maturities  which are million and million in years and  respectively 
alternatively  we may choose to cash settle these swaps at their fair value prior to their mandatory early termination dates  or unless these dates are extended  we will cash settle these swaps for an amount equal to their fair value on the stated termination dates 
in addition  we have million notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swaps  having a maximum term of seven years 
these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly  their mark to market adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the mark to market value of these swaps was a liability of million at december  working capital the most significant items impacting working capital are our capital expenditures  the purchase of natural gas for our regulated gas utilities  and funding for natural gas and crude oil marketing activities 
we could experience significant working capital requirements during peak months of the winter heating season due to higher natural gas consumption and during periods of high natural gas prices 
we anticipate using a combination of credit capacity available under our corporate revolver and cash on hand to meet our peak winter working capital requirements 
our energy marketing segment engages in trading activities involving natural gas storage which carry working capital requirements 
the level of those requirements vary depending on market circumstances  the capacity contracted for by the company and the degree to which the company has elected to utilize those opportunities 
in addition  enserco s credit facility contains working capital requirements for each borrowing base election level 
collateral as of december   we had posted with counterparties the following amounts of collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in thousands trading positions energy marketing utility cash collateral requirements letters of credit on corporate credit facility total funds on deposit collateral requirements for our trading positions will fluctuate based on the movement in commodity prices and our credit rating 
changes in collateral requirements will vary depending on the magnitude of the price movement and the current position of our energy marketing trading portfolio 
as these trading positions settle in the future  the collateral will be returned 
at our gas utilities and energy marketing segments  we are required to post collateral with certain commodity and pipeline transportation vendors 
this amount will fluctuate depending on gas prices and projected volumetric deliveries 
utility money pool as a utility holding company  we are required to establish a cash management program to address lending and borrowing activities between our utility subsidiaries and the company 
we have established utility money pool agreements which address these requirements 
these agreements are on file with ferc and appropriate state regulators 
under the utility money pool agreements  our utilities may borrow and extend short term loans to our other utilities via a utility money pool at market based rates at december  
while the utility money pool may borrow funds from the company as ultimate parent company  the money pool arrangement does not allow loans from our utility subsidiaries to the company as ultimate parent company or to non regulated affiliates 
at december   money pool balances included in thousands subsidiary borrowings from loans to money pool outstanding at december  black hills utility holdings black hills power cheyenne light registration statements our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of million shares of common stock  par value  and million shares of preferred stock  no par value 
as of december   we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding  and no shares of preferred stock outstanding 
the company has an effective automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which we may issue  from time to time  senior debt securities  subordinated debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  warrants and other securities 
although the shelf registration statement does not limit our issuance capacity  our ability to issue securities is limited to the authority granted by our board of directors  certain covenants in our finance arrangements and restrictions imposed by federal and state regulatory authorities 
anticipated financing plans we have substantial capital expenditure requirements in and  which are primarily due to the construction of additional generation to serve our colorado electric utility 
our capital requirements for and are expected to be financed through a combination of operating cash flows  borrowings on our revolving credit facility and long term financings 
we intend to maintain a consolidated debt to capitalization level in the range of to 
we expect to complete long term senior unsecured debt financings at the holding company level in or  a portion of the long term debt financings may be completed at certain subsidiaries 
we also intend to complete a portion of the permanent financing through the issuance of common stock to maintain our target debt to capitalization level 
factors influencing liquidity many of our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow 
we have traditionally sourced i variations in the working capital needs of our subsidiaries with cash on hand and capacity available under our credit facilities  and ii the capital expenditures of our subsidiaries through a combination of internally generated cash  equity contributions and borrowings by our subsidiaries from us financed primarily with net proceeds of equity and long term debt issuances by us and  in limited instances  debt offerings by our subsidiaries 
increased volatility in commodity prices and interest rates has made it more difficult for us to adequately forecast the liquidity needs of our subsidiary operations 
moreover  based on general market conditions and various predictions of a prolonged recession and weak recovery  we face an increasing risk of higher payment defaults by our customers 
as a result  our liquidity needs are subject to greater fluctuation and are more difficult to forecast than in the past 
to the extent we issue long term debt securities or arrange new credit facilities or extensions of existing credit lines in the bank loan market  we expect to pay significant fees in connection with these activities 
in particular  future banking fees for new credit facilities or additional maturity extensions may be significantly more costly than in the past 
although our utility operations are subject to regulatory lag in terms of recovering capital expenditures and other prudently incurred costs  revenues from our utility operations traditionally have been stable 
in light of volatile commodity prices and the lingering effects of a severe economic recession  our cash flows from utility operations could be less stable going forward 
as a utility holding company which owns several regulated utilities  we are subject to various regulations that could influence our liquidity 
for example  the issuance of debt by our utility subsidiaries including the ability of black hills utility holdings to issue debt and the use of our utility assets as collateral generally requires the prior approval of the state regulators in the state in which the utility assets are located 
as a result of our holding company structure  our right as a common shareholder  to receive assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization  is junior to the claims against the assets of such subsidiaries by their creditors 
therefore  our holding company debt obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future claims of the creditors of our subsidiaries  including trade creditors  debt holders  secured creditors  taxing authorities  and guarantee holders 
due to market conditions  the funding status of our pension plans for and future periods is subject to multiple variables  most of which are beyond our control  including changes to the fair value of the pension assets and changes in actuarial assumptions in particular  the discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation 
as a result  we may be required to contribute material amounts to our pension plans in and future periods  which could materially affect our liquidity and results of operations 
credit ratings credit ratings impact our ability to obtain short and long term financing  the cost of such financing  and vendor payment terms  including collateral requirements 
as of december   our senior unsecured credit ratings  as assessed by the three major credit rating agencies  were as follows rating agency rating outlook moody s baa stable s p bbb stable fitch bbb stable in addition  the first mortgage bonds issued by black hills power were rated at december  as follows rating agency rating outlook moody s a stable s p bbb stable fitch a stable we do not have any trigger events ie  an acceleration of repayment of outstanding indebtedness  an increase in interest costs or the posting of additional cash collateral tied to our stock price and have not executed any transactions that require us to issue equity based on our credit ratings or other trigger events 
if our senior unsecured credit rating should drop below investment grade  pricing under our credit agreements would be affected  increasing annual interest expense by approximately million pre tax based on our december  debt balances 
we have an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million which has collateral requirements based upon our corporate credit ratings 
at our current credit ratings  we would be required to post collateral for any amount by which the swap s negative mark to market fair value exceeds million 
if our senior unsecured credit rating would drop to bb or below by s p  or ba or below by moody s  we would be required to post collateral for the entire amount of the swap s negative mark to market fair value

capital expenditures for our electric utilities include expenditures associated with our colorado electric energy resource plan 
the construction of two natural gas fired combustion turbine facilities at colorado electric are expected to cost approximately million to million 
the planned expenditures included in this table reflect the mid point of this range 
we expect to spend approximately million and million in and  respectively  for this construction 
included in these expected expenditures is million and million in and  respectively  for transmission construction projects at colorado electric 
development capital for our oil and gas properties is expected to be limited to no more than the cash flows produced by those properties 
continued low commodity prices make many of our development drilling sites uneconomical  which could further reduce our development capital expenditures 
our power generation segment was awarded the bid to provide mw of power through a year ppa with colorado electric 
the total construction cost is expected to be approximately million to million which is expected to be completed by the end of the planned expenditures included in this table reflect the mid point of this range 
we expect to spend approximately million and million in and  respectively  on this construction 
contractual obligations and commitments the following information is provided to summarize our cash obligations and commercial commitments at december  actual future costs of estimated obligations may differ materially from these amounts

the energy charge under the purchase power agreement and the commodity price under the gas purchase contract are variable costs  which for purposes of estimating our future obligations  were based on costs incurred during and price assumptions using existing prices at december  the pricing for the psco power purchase agreement is based on annual contracted capacity and an load factor at current ferc approved rates 
our transmission obligations are based on filed tariffs as of december  d includes operating leases associated with several office buildings  warehouses and call centers  equipment and vehicle leases 
e represents a capital lease on office equipment 
f includes estimated asset retirement obligations associated with our oil and gas  coal mining  electric utilities and gas utilities segments as discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
g represents estimated employer contributions to employee benefit plans through the year h years includes an estimated reversal of approximately million associated with the gain deferred from the tax treatment related to the ipp transaction and the aquila transaction 
the liability includes an income tax refund receivable of approximately million that is long term in nature and reflected in the after years category in the above table 
i amounts in the above table exclude any obligation that may arise from our derivatives  including interest rate swaps and commodity related contracts that have a negative fair value at december  these amounts have been excluded as it is impracticable to reasonably estimate the final amount and or timing of any associated payments 
dividends our dividend payout ratio for the year ended december   was compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
dividends paid on our common stock totaled per share in  as compared to per share in and per share in our three year annualized dividend growth rate was  and all dividends were paid out of operating cash flows 
in january  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share 
if this dividend is maintained throughout  it will be equivalent to per share 
the determination of the amount of future cash dividends  if any  to be declared and paid will depend upon  among other things  our financial condition  funds from operations  the level of our capital expenditures  restrictions under our credit facilities and our future business prospects 
dividend restrictions due to our holding company structure  substantially all of our operating cash flow is provided by dividends paid or distributions made by our subsidiaries 
as a result  certain statutory limitations or regulatory or financing agreements could affect the levels of distributions allowed to be made by our subsidiaries 
our utility subsidiaries are generally limited to the amount of dividends allowed by state regulatory authorities to be paid to us as a utility holding company and also may have further restrictions under the federal power act 
as of december   the net assets restricted from distribution at our regulated electric and regulated gas utilities were approximately million 
in december  one of the covenants to the enserco credit facility was amended to temporarily increase the allowable rolling twelve month net cumulative loss as calculated on a non gaap basis and temporarily restrict all dividends or loans to the company 
in addition to the borrowing base structure which requires enserco to maintain certain levels of tangible net worth and net working capital  the amendment to the covenants restricted of enserco s net assets 
therefore  upon review of this covenant at december   restricted net assets at enserco total million for this stand alone enserco credit facility 
the amendment to the covenants expired on december   and is not a requirement under the facility subsequent to december  off balance sheet arrangements guarantees we provide various guarantees supporting certain of our subsidiaries under specified agreements or transactions 
at december   we had guarantees totaling million in place 
of the million  million was related to performance obligations under subsidiary contracts and million was related to indemnification for reclamation and surety bonds of subsidiaries 
for more information on these guarantees  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k

variable interest entities in  our black hills wyoming subsidiary entered into an agreement with wygen funding  limited partnership the variable interest entity to lease the wygen i plant 
we were considered the primary beneficiary of this arrangement and  therefore  we included the vie in our consolidated financial statements 
the initial term of the lease was five years and included a purchase option equal to the adjusted acquisition cost  which was essentially equal to the cost of the plant 
we guaranteed the obligations of black hills wyoming under the lease agreement 
at the end of the initial lease term in june  we elected to purchase the wygen i plant at an adjusted acquisition cost of million 
in conjunction with this purchase  we retired million of wygen i project debt through borrowings on our revolving credit facility  and extinguished the million guarantee obligation under the wygen i lease 
since the plant and its financial activities were previously consolidated into our financial statements  the transaction had minimal impact on our consolidated financial statements 
cash flow activities cash flows from operations of million increased million from the prior year amount  due primarily to a million increase in income from continuing operations and the following an million increase in cash flows from working capital changes 
this increase primarily resulted from a million increase from lower accounts receivable and other current assets offset by a million decrease from lower accounts payable and other current liabilities 
a million decrease in materials  supplies and fuel primarily relates to natural gas held in storage by energy marketing and the regulated gas utilities which fluctuates based on seasonal trends and economic decisions reflecting current market conditions  a million increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  a million pre tax unrealized gain related to interest rate swaps marked to market through earnings compared to a million unrealized loss in  a million increase in cash flows from the net change in derivative assets and liabilities primarily from derivatives associated with normal operations of our gas and oil marketing business and our oil and gas segment related to commodity price fluctuations  a million increase in cash flows from regulatory assets and liabilities primarily resulting from deferred gas adjustments for our regulated gas utilities segment and employee benefits at our regulated electric utilities and regulated gas utilities  a million decrease to adjust for the non cash effect of the gain on sale of operating assets 
this gain relates to the sale of interest in the wygen i power plant to mean for which we received million included in investing activities  a million decrease for non cash ceiling test impairment charges to write down the net carrying value of our natural gas and crude oil properties due to low year end commodity prices  and a million increase from deferred income taxes primarily the result of accelerated deductions associated with property  plant and equipment 
net cash outflows from investing activities of million  included the following cash outflows of million of property  plant and equipment additions 
significant additions during included approximately million for wygen iii  and approximately million for construction of mw of natural gas fired electric generation in colorado  cash inflows of million of proceeds from the sale of the ownership interest in the wygen i power plant to mean  cash inflows of million of proceeds from the sale of the ownership interest in the wygen iii power plant to mdu  and cash inflows of million for working capital adjustments on the purchase price allocation for the aquila transaction 
net cash outflows from financing activities of million included the following net cash outflows of million for net re payment on the corporate credit facility and the acquisition facility  cash outflows of million of cash dividends on common stock  cash inflows of million from the proceeds from issuance of senior unsecured five year notes  cash inflows of million from the proceeds of first mortgage bonds  and cash inflows of million from the proceeds of a black hills wyoming project financing 
cash flows from operations of million decreased million from the prior year amount  due primarily to a million decrease in income from continuing operations and by the following a million decrease in cash flows from the change in operating assets and liabilities 
the primary changes include changes in working capital accounts and current tax effects of both the ipp transaction and the aquila transaction  higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of million  a million pre tax unrealized loss related to interest rate swaps marked to market through earnings  and a million pre tax ceiling test impairment charge to write down the net carrying value of our natural gas and crude oil properties due to low year end commodity prices 
we had net cash outflows from investing activities of million  including the acquisition costs of million for the aquila transaction  and approximately million of property  plant and equipment additions 
significant additions during included approximately million for wygen iii  approximately million for development drilling at our oil and gas properties  and million for the acquisition of an additional non operated interest in a wyoming oil and gas property 
partially offsetting the cash outflows from investing activities was million of cash received for the ipp transaction 
we had net cash inflows from financing activities of million primarily due to the following a million increase in borrowings under the acquisition facility  in conjunction with the aquila transaction  and a million increase in borrowings on our revolving bank facility 
partially offsetting the cash inflows from financing activities were the following the payment of million of cash dividends on common stock  repayment of million of long term debt  including million for the wygen i project level debt  and repayment of million for colorado ipp project level debt  which was retired as part of the ipp transaction and is included in financing activities of discontinued operations 
market risk disclosures our activities expose us to a number of risks in the normal operation of our businesses 
depending on the activity  we are exposed to varying degrees of market risk and counterparty risk 
we have developed policies  processes  systems  and controls to manage and mitigate these risks 
market risk is the potential loss that might occur as a result of an adverse change in market price or rate 
we are exposed to the following market risks commodity price risk associated with our marketing business  our natural long position with crude oil and natural gas reserves and production  and fuel procurement for certain of our gas fired generation assets  interest rate risk associated with our variable rate credit facilities and our project financing floating rate debt as described in notes and of our notes to consolidated financial statements  and foreign currency exchange risk associated with our natural gas marketing business transacted in canadian dollars 
our exposure to these market risks is affected by a number of factors including the size  duration  and composition of our energy portfolio  the absolute and relative levels of interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity prices  the volatility of these prices and rates  and the liquidity of the related interest rate and commodity markets 
to manage and mitigate these identified risks  we have adopted the bhcrpp 
these policies have been approved by our executive risk committee and reviewed by our board of directors 
these policies include governance  control infrastructure  authorized commodities and trading instruments  prohibited activities  employee conduct  etc 
the executive risk committee  which includes senior level executives  meets on a regular basis to review our business and credit activities and to ensure that these activities are conducted within the authorized policies 
utilities we produce  purchase and distribute power in four states  and purchase and distribute natural gas in five states 
all of our gas distribution utilities have pga provisions that allow them to pass the prudently incurred cost of gas through to the customer 
to the extent that gas prices are higher or lower than amounts in our current billing rates  adjustments are made on a periodic basis to true up billed amounts to match the actual natural gas cost we incurred 
these adjustments are subject to periodic prudence reviews by the state utility commissions 
in south dakota  colorado  wyoming and montana  we have a mechanism for our regulated electric utilities that serves a purpose similar to the pgas for our regulated gas utilities 
to the extent that our fuel and purchased power energy costs are higher or lower than the energy cost built into our tariffs  the difference or a portion thereof is passed through to the customer 
as allowed or required by state utility commissions  we have entered into certain exchange traded natural gas futures  options and basis swaps to reduce our customers underlying exposure to volatility of natural gas prices 
these transactions are considered derivatives and are marked to market 
gains or losses  as well as option premiums on these transactions  are recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities 
the fair value of our gas utilities derivative contracts are summarized below in thousands december  december  net derivative liabilities cash collateral trading activities natural gas and crude oil marketing we have a natural gas and crude oil marketing business specializing in producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing that conducts business in the western and mid continent regions of the united states and canada 
for producer services our main objective is to provide value in the supply chain by acting as the producer s marketing arm for wellhead purchases  scheduling services  imbalance management  risk management services and transportation management 
we accomplish this goal through industry experience  extensive contacts  transportation and risk management expertise  trading skills and personal attention 
our end use origination efforts focus on supplying and providing electricity generators and industrial customers with flexible options to procure their energy inputs and asset optimization services to these large end use consumers of natural gas 
our wholesale marketing activity has two functions support the efforts of producer services and end use origination groups  and marketing and trading natural gas and crude oil 
to effectively manage our producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing portfolios  we enter into forward physical commodity contracts  financial derivative instruments including over the counter swaps and options  and storage and transportation agreements 
we conduct our energy marketing business activities within the parameters as defined and allowed in the bhcrpp and further delineated in the energy marketing risk management policies and procedures as approved by our executive risk committee 
monitoring and reporting market risk exposures we use a number of quantitative tools to measure  monitor and limit our exposure to market risk in our natural gas and oil marketing portfolio 
we limit and monitor our market risk through established limits on the nominal size of positions based on type of trade  location and duration 
such limits include those on fixed price  basis  index  storage  transportation and foreign exchange positions 
our market risk limits are monitored by our risk management function to ensure compliance with our stated risk limits 
the risk management function operates independently from our energy marketing group 
the limits are measured  monitored and regularly reported to and reviewed by our executive risk committee 
daily risk management activities include reviewing positions in relation to established position limits  assessing changes in daily mark to market and other non statistical risk management techniques 
the contract or notional amounts  terms and mark to market values of our natural gas and crude oil marketing and derivative commodity instruments at december  and  are set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k

to value the assets and liabilities for our outstanding derivative contracts  we use the fair value methodology outlined in accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the sources of fair value measurements were as follows in thousands maturities source of fair value less than year years total fair value level level level cash collateral market value adjustment for inventory see footnote a above total fair value of our energy marketing positions gaap restricts mark to market accounting treatment primarily to only those contracts that meet the definition of a derivative under accounting standards for derivatives and hedges 
therefore  the above reconciliation does not present a complete picture of our overall portfolio of trading activities or our expected cash flows from energy trading activities 
in our natural gas and crude oil marketing operations  we often employ strategies that include utilizing derivative contracts along with inventory  storage and transportation positions to accomplish the objectives of our producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing groups 
except in circumstances when we are able to designate transportation  storage or inventory positions as part of a fair value hedge  accounting standards for derivatives generally do not allow us to mark our inventory  transportation or storage positions to market 
the result is that while a significant majority of our energy marketing positions are fully economically hedged  we are required to mark some parts of our overall strategies the derivatives to market value  but are generally precluded from marking the rest of our economic hedges transportation  inventory or storage to market 
volatility in reported earnings and derivative positions should be expected given these accounting requirements 
the table below references non gaap measures that quantify these positions 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our energy marketing positions recorded at fair value under gaap to a non gaap measure of the fair value of our energy marketing forward book wherein all forward trading positions are marked to market in thousands december  december  fair value of our energy marketing positions marked to market in accordance with gaap see footnote a above market value adjustments for inventory  storage and transportation positions that are not marked to market under gaap fair value of all forward positions non gaap cash collateral included in gaap fair value fair value of all forward positions excluding cash collateral non gaap we consider this measure a non gaap financial measure 
this measure is presented because we believe it provides a more comprehensive view to our investors of our energy trading activities and thus a better understanding of these activities than would be presented by the gaap measure alone 
activities other than trading oil and gas exploration and production we produce natural gas and crude oil through our exploration and production activities 
our reserves are natural long positions  or unhedged open positions  and introduce commodity price risk and variability in our cash flows 
we employ risk management methods to mitigate this commodity price risk and preserve our cash flows 
we have adopted guidelines covering hedging for our natural gas and crude oil production 
these guidelines have been approved by our executive risk committee and reviewed by our board of directors 
to mitigate commodity price risk and preserve cash flows  we primarily use over the counter swaps and options 
our hedging policy allows up to of our natural gas and of our crude oil production from proven producing reserves to be hedged for a period up to two years in the future 
our hedging strategy is conducted from an enterprise wide risk perspective  accordingly  we might not externally hedge a portion of our natural gas production when we have offsetting price risk for the fuel requirements of certain of our power generating activities 
the company has entered into agreements to hedge a portion of its estimated  and natural gas and crude oil production 
the hedge agreements in place are as follows natural gas location transaction date hedge type term volume mmbtu day price cig swap nwr swap aeco swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap aeco swap san juan el paso swap aeco swap aeco swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap cig swap cig swap cig swap cig swap nwr swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap nwr swap aeco swap nwr swap nwr swap nwr swap nwr swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap aeco swap nwr swap san juan el paso swap cig swap cig swap nwr swap san juan el paso swap cig swap nwr swap aeco swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap nwr swap san juan el paso swap aeco swap cig swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap nwr swap aeco swap cig swap san juan el paso swap crude oil location transaction date hedge type term volume bbls month price nymex put nymex swap nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex put nymex put nymex swap nymex swap nymex put nymex put nymex put nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex put nymex put nymex swap the hedge agreements entered into by the company as of december  had a fair value of approximately million as of december  wholesale power a potential risk related to power sales is the price risk arising from the sale of wholesale power that exceeds our generating capacity 
these short positions can arise from unplanned plant outages or from unanticipated load demands 
to control such risk  we restrict wholesale off system sales to amounts by which our anticipated generating capabilities and purchased power resources exceed our anticipated load requirements plus a required reserve margin 
financing activities we engage in activities to manage risks associated with changes in interest rates 
we have entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with our floating rate debt obligations 
at december   we had million of notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swaps  having a maximum term of years 
these swaps have been designated as hedges in accordance with accounting standards for derivatives and hedges and accordingly their mark to market adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet 
we also have interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million which were entered into for the purpose of hedging interest rate movements that would impact long term financings that were originally expected to occur in the swaps were originally designated as cash flow hedges and the mark to market value was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet 
based on credit market conditions that transpired during the fourth quarter of  we determined it was probable that the forecasted long term debt financings would not occur in the time period originally specified and as a result  the swaps were no longer effective hedges and the hedge relationships were de designated 
mark to market adjustments on the swaps are now recorded within the income statement and during we recorded a million pre tax unrealized mark to market gain to earnings  while in we recorded a million pre tax unrealized mark to market charge to earnings 
these swaps are ten and twenty year swaps which have amended mandatory early termination dates ranging from december  to december  we have continued to maintain these swaps in anticipation of our upcoming financing needs  particularly as they relate to our planned capital requirements to build gas fired power generation facilities to serve our colorado electric customers  and our upcoming holding company debt maturities  which are million and million in years and  respectively 
alternatively  we may choose to cash settle these swaps at their fair value prior to their mandatory early termination dates  or unless these dates are extended  we will cash settle these swaps for an amount equal to their fair value on the stated termination dates 
further details of the swap agreements are set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
on december  and  our interest rate swaps and related balances were as follows dollars in thousands december  notional weighted average fixed interest rate maximum terms in years current assets non current assets current liabilities non current liabilities pre tax accumulated other comprehensive income loss pre tax income loss interest rate swaps interest rate swaps december  interest rate swaps interest rate swaps based on december  market interest rates and balances  a loss of approximately million would be realized and reported in pre tax earnings during the next twelve months 
estimated and realized losses will likely change during the next twelve months as market interest rates change 
the table below presents principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our long term debt obligations  including current maturities dollars in thousands thereafter total long term debt fixed rate a average interest rate variable rate average interest rate total long term debt average interest rate a excludes unamortized premium or discount 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from non performance of contractual obligations by a counterparty 
we have adopted the bhccp that establishes guidelines  controls  and limits to manage and mitigate credit risk within risk tolerances established by the board of directors 
in addition  our executive credit committee  which includes senior executives  meets on a regular basis to review our credit activities and to monitor compliance with the adopted policies 
for our energy marketing  production  and generation activities  we seek to mitigate our credit risk by conducting a majority of our business with investment grade companies  setting tenor and credit limits commensurate with counterparty financial strength  obtaining netting agreements  and securing our credit exposure with less creditworthy counterparties through parental guarantees  prepayments  letters of credit  and other security agreements 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and provisions established  we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past  or that an investment grade counterparty will not default sometime in the future 
at december   approximately of our credit exposure exclusive of retail customers of our regulated utilities was with investment grade companies 
the remaining credit exposure is with non investment grade or non rated counterparties  of which a portion was supported through letters of credit  prepayments  or parental guarantees 
foreign exchange contracts our natural gas and crude oil marketing subsidiary conducts its business in the united states and canada 
transactions in canada are generally transacted in canadian dollars  which creates exchange rate risk 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to offset earnings volatility from changes in exchange rates between the canadian and united states dollars 
at december   we had no outstanding forward exchange contracts 
at december   we had outstanding forward exchange contracts to purchase approximately million canadian dollars 
these contracts had a fair value of million at december   and have been recorded as derivative assets liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
