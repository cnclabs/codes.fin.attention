item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion of factors that affect the comparability of the selected financial data 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background and general our discussions below in this item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  included in this annual report on form k 
we are engaged in the manufacturing  fabrication  and distribution of specialty metals 
we primarily process basic raw materials such as nickel  cobalt  titanium  manganese  chromium  molybdenum  iron scrap and other metal alloying elements through various melting  hot forming and cold working facilities to produce finished products in the form of billet  bar  rod  wire and narrow strip in many sizes and finishes 
we also produce certain metal powders 
our sales are distributed directly from our production plants and distribution network as well as through independent distributors 
unlike many other specialty steel producers  we operate our own worldwide network of service distribution centers 
these service centers  located in the united states  canada  mexico  europe and asia allow us to work more closely with customers and to offer various just in time stocking programs 
as part of our overall business strategy  we have sought out and considered opportunities related to strategic acquisitions and joint collaborations aimed at broadening our offering to the marketplace 
we have participated with other companies to explore potential terms and structure of such opportunities and we expect that we will continue to evaluate these opportunities 
business trends selected financial results for the past three fiscal years are summarized below fiscal year in millions  except per share data net sales net sales excluding surcharges operating income excluding pension eid expense and restructuring costs income from continuing operations net income diluted earnings per share from continuing operations diluted earnings per share purchases of property  equipment and software free cash flow pounds sold in thousands see the section non gaap financial measures below for further discussion of these financial measures 
includes specialty and titanium alloys  stainless steel and powder materials 
table of contents our sales are across a diversified list of end use markets 
the table below summarizes our estimated sales by market over the past three fiscal years 
fiscal year in millions aerospace industrial energy medical consumer automotive total net sales the table below shows our net sales by major product class for the past three fiscal years fiscal year in millions special alloys stainless steels titanium products other materials total net sales impact of raw material prices and product mix we value most of our inventory utilizing the last in  first out lifo inventory costing methodology 
under the lifo inventory costing method  changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these materials may have been acquired at potentially significantly different values due to the length of time from the acquisition of the raw materials to the sale of the processed finished goods to the customers 
in a period of rising raw material costs  the lifo inventory valuation normally results in higher costs of sales 
conversely  in a period of decreasing raw material costs  the lifo inventory valuation normally results in lower costs of sales 
the volatility of the costs of raw materials has impacted our operations over the past several years 
we  and others in our industry  generally have been able to pass cost increases on major raw materials through to our customers using surcharges that are structured to recover increases in raw material costs 
generally  the formula used to calculate a surcharge is based on published prices of the respective raw materials for the previous month  which correlates to the prices we pay for our raw material purchases 
however  a portion of our surcharges may be calculated based on the raw material prices at the time of order  which creates a lag between surcharge revenue and corresponding raw material costs recognized in costs of sales 
the surcharge mechanism protects our net income on such sales 
however  surcharges have had a dilutive effect on our gross margin and operating margin percentages as described later in this report 
a portion of our business consists of sales to customers under firm price sales arrangements 
firm price sales arrangements involve a risk of profit margin fluctuations  particularly when raw material prices are volatile 
in order to reduce the risk of fluctuating profit margins on these sales  we enter into commodity forward contracts to purchase certain critical raw materials necessary to produce the related products sold 
firm price sales arrangements generally include certain annual purchasing commitments and consumption schedules agreed to by the customers at selling prices based on raw material prices at the time the arrangements are 
table of contents established 
if a customer fails to meet the volume commitments or the consumption schedule deviates from the agreed upon terms of the firm price sales arrangements  the company may need to absorb the gains or losses associated with the commodity forward contracts on a temporary basis 
gains or losses associated with commodity forward contracts are reclassified to earnings loss when earnings are impacted by the hedged transaction 
because we value most of our inventory under the lifo costing methodology  the gains and or losses associated with commodity forward contracts may not impact the same period that the firm price sales arrangements revenue is recognized  and comparisons of gross profit from period to period may be impacted 
we produce hundreds of grades of materials  with a wide range of pricing and profit levels depending on the grade 
in addition  our product mix within a period is subject to the fluctuating order patterns of our customers as well as decisions we may make to participate in certain lower margin business in order to utilize available capacity 
while we expect to see positive contribution from a more favorable product mix in our margin performance over time  the impact by period may fluctuate  and period to period comparisons may vary 
net pension expense income net pension expense income  as we define it below  includes the net periodic benefit costs related to both our pension and other postretirement plans 
net pension expense is recorded in accounts that are included in both the cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses lines of our statements of income 
the following is a summary of the classification of net pension expense included in our statements of income during fiscal years  and fiscal year in millions cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses pension settlement charges included in restructuring charges net pension expense income net pension expense income is determined annually based on beginning of year balances  and is recorded ratably throughout the fiscal year  unless a significant re measurement event occurs 
the following is a summary of the components of net pension expense during fiscal year  and fiscal year in millions service cost pension earnings  interest and deferrals pension settlement charges included in restructuring charges net pension expense income the service cost component of net pension expense represents the estimated cost of future pension liabilities earned associated with active employees 
the pension earnings  interest and deferrals expense is comprised of the expected return on plan assets  interest costs on the projected benefit obligations of the plans  and amortization of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs 
pension earnings  interest and deferrals expenses is impacted by the financial markets and increased significantly during fiscal year and principally due to the decline in market value of the securities held by the plans as of june  and 
table of contents operating performance overview market conditions were challenging at the start of fiscal year as we ended the fiscal year  we are encouraged with the strength and momentum of the business 
our forward order book is robust 
our utilization rates are increasing and we are adding production workers 
it is critical that we remain well positioned to meet growing customer demand as it unfolds 
fiscal year highlights include the following we increased our share in key markets by enhancing our relationships with key customers and diversifying our customer base 
we invested further in research and development  which will lead to a more robust new product pipeline and make an important contribution to overall growth 
we have increased our external collaboration efforts to position us at the forefront of new technology and innovation which will help us grow the strategic parts of our business 
we strengthened our financial position  which should enable us to pursue growth opportunities 
we had a solid year of cash flow performance and remain financially strong 
we are excited about our long term growth opportunities  particularly in aerospace and energy and we remain focused on ultimately exceeding our prior peak level of financial performance 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year for fiscal year  we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  compared with income of million  or per diluted share  a year earlier 
our fiscal year results reflect a trend of improving revenues and profit throughout the fiscal year 
for fiscal year lower revenues and the impacts of an unfavorable shift in product mix have been offset by cost improvement initiatives 
in addition  as discussed above  our net income results reflect the million increase in our net pension expense in fiscal year net sales net sales for fiscal year were  million  which was a percent decrease from fiscal year excluding surcharge revenues  sales were percent lower than a year earlier on percent higher volume 
geographically  sales outside the united states decreased percent from a year ago to million 
international sales remained fairly consistent as a percentage of our total net sales  representing percent and percent for fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 

table of contents sales by end use markets we sell to customers across diversified end use markets 
during fiscal year  we changed the manner in which sales are classified by end use market so that we could better evaluate our sales results from period to period 
in order to make the discussion of net sales by end use market meaningful  we have reclassified the fiscal year sales by end use market balances to conform to the fiscal year presentation 
the following table includes comparative information for our estimated net sales by principal end use markets fiscal year increase increase in millions decrease decrease aerospace industrial energy medical consumer automotive total net sales the following table includes comparative information for our estimated net sales by the same principal end use markets  but excluding surcharge revenues fiscal year increase increase in millions decrease decrease aerospace industrial energy medical consumer automotive total net sales excluding surcharge revenues sales to the aerospace market decreased percent from fiscal year to million 
excluding surcharge revenue  such sales decreased percent on percent lower shipment volume 
the sales decline reflects lower airplane build levels  reductions of inventory in the supply chain and a less favorable mix of products 
industrial market sales decreased percent from fiscal year to million 
adjusted for surcharge revenue  such sales decreased approximately percent while volumes increased percent 
the results reflect the higher demand for lower value products sold primarily through distributors 
industrial markets continue to show signs of steady improvement 
with many of our larger customers in this segment  our first and second quarter backlogs of fiscal year are already full 
sales to the energy market of million reflected a percent decrease from the fiscal year excluding surcharge revenue  such sales decreased percent on percent lower shipment volume 
the sales results reflect the impacts of excess inventories in the supply chain  as a result of significantly lower oil and gas drilling along with sluggish demand for high capacity industrial gas turbines 
we are continuing to focus on diversifying our customer base  market segments served and product offerings in the broader energy market 
we think that the energy market has the potential to be our fastest growing market 

table of contents sales to the medical market decreased percent to million from a year ago 
adjusted for surcharge revenue  such sales decreased percent  while volumes increased percent 
the shipment volume increase reflects the impact of an increase in demand for stainless steel materials used in medical implants and gains in market share with key customers  while the revenue decline is attributable to lower raw material costs for titanium and a less favorable mix of products 
sales to the consumer market increased percent to million from a year ago 
adjusted for surcharge revenue  such sales increased percent with shipment volume higher by percent 
the results reflect increased demand in all segments along with an unfavorable shift in product mix 
automotive market sales increased percent from the fiscal year to million 
excluding surcharge revenue  such sales increased percent on percent higher shipment volume 
the results reflect higher volumes associated with a steady upswing in demand from the same period last year coupled with an unfavorable shift in product mix 
our objective is to increase our participation with long standing customers to provide higher value components for engine applications 
sales by product class the following table includes comparative information for our net sales by major product class fiscal year in millions decrease decrease special alloys stainless steels titanium products other materials total net sales the following table includes comparative information for our net sales by the same major product class  but excluding surcharge revenues fiscal year in millions decrease decrease special alloys stainless steels titanium products other materials total net sales excluding surcharge revenues sales of special alloys products decreased percent in fiscal year as compared with a year ago to million 
excluding surcharge revenue  sales decreased percent on a percent increase in shipment volume 
the sales results principally reflect the decline in demand from the higher value aerospace and energy market products 
sales of stainless steels decreased percent as compared with a year ago 
excluding surcharge revenues  such sales decreased by percent on a percent higher shipment volume 
the results reflect a moderate increase in demand that was more than offset by an unfavorable shift in product mix in materials used in the automotive  industrial and consumer markets 

table of contents sales of titanium products decreased percent as compared with a year ago on percent lower shipment volume 
the results reflect the impact of significantly lower titanium prices and decreased demand for titanium products used in the aerospace end use market 
gross profit gross profit in fiscal year decreased to million  or percent of net sales percent of net sales excluding surcharges  from million  or percent of net sales percent of net sales excluding surcharges  a year ago 
the results primarily reflect the favorable impacts of higher volumes and cost savings initiatives in fiscal year offset by an unfavorable shift in product mix and the higher net pension expense included in costs of sales during fiscal year our surcharge mechanism is structured to recover increases in raw material costs  although generally with a lag effect 
while the surcharge generally protects the absolute gross profit dollars  it does have a dilutive effect on gross margin as a percent of sales 
the following represents a summary of the dilutive impact of the surcharges on gross margin for fiscal years and see the section non gaap financial measures below for further discussion of these financial metrics 
fiscal year in millions net sales less surcharge revenue net sales excluding surcharges gross profit gross margin gross margin excluding dilutive effect of surcharges in addition to the impact of the surcharge mechanism  fluctuations in raw material prices combined with fluctuations in inventory levels have impacted our gross profit from year to year 
we estimate that the effect of such combined fluctuations had no impact on gross margin in fiscal year and negatively impacted gross margin by basis points in fiscal year we estimate that the lag effect of the surcharge mechanism negatively impacted gross margin by approximately basis points during fiscal year  compared to a positive impact on gross margin of approximately basis points during fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year were million  or percent of net sales percent of net sales excluding surcharges  compared to million  or percent of net sales percent of net sales excluding surcharges  in fiscal year excluding the impact of changes in net pension expense discussed above  expenses decreased by percent over fiscal year restructuring charges during fiscal year  we recorded million of restructuring charges associated with the closure of our metal strip manufacturing facility in the united kingdom uk 
the charges recorded consisted principally of pension settlement charges from the elimination of a uk defined benefit pension plan  certain asset write downs  payments of employee severance costs and other exit costs 

table of contents operating income our operating income in fiscal year decreased to million as compared with million in fiscal year the lower operating income principally reflects lower gross profit levels 
the results for fiscal year included approximately million of restructuring charges associated with the closure of a uk facility 
operating income has been significantly impacted by our pension earnings  interest and deferrals pension eid portion of our net pension expense  which may be volatile based on conditions in the financial markets 
the following presents our operating income and operating margin  in each case excluding the impact of surcharges on net sales and excluding the impacts of pension eid expense and restructuring costs from operating income 
we present and discuss these financial measures because management believes removing the impact of volatile and restructuring charges provides a more consistent and meaningful basis for comparing results of operations from period to period 
see the section non gaap financial measures below for further discussion of these financial measures 
in millions fiscal year net sales less surcharge revenue net sales excluding surcharges operating income add back pension eid expense add back restructuring costs operating income excluding pension eid expense and restructuring costs operating margin excluding surcharges  pension eid expense and restructuring costs interest expense fiscal year interest expense of million increased percent from million in fiscal year interest on substantially all of our debt was at a fixed rate 
the increase in interest expense is attributable to the million decrease in the amount of interest capitalized associated with ongoing construction projects during fiscal year as compared with fiscal year which was offset by the reductions in outstanding debt related to current year repayments 
other income  net other income for fiscal year was million as compared with million a year ago 
the decrease principally reflected lower returns on invested cash balances and less foreign exchange gains in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year 
table of contents income taxes our effective tax rate income tax expense as a percent of income before taxes for fiscal year was percent as compared to percent in fiscal year the fiscal year tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of percent  primarily due to the following items 
we recorded an income tax expense charge in the amount of million to reduce the value of the company s deferred tax asset previously established for anticipated retiree health care liabilities 
offsetting this amount  there was a reduction in income tax expense in the amount of million due to the reversal of certain unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of certain statutes of limitations 
our lower taxable income level also resulted in our permanent book to tax differences having a more significant impact on the effective tax rate 
the fiscal year tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of percent  primarily due to the following items 
we recorded a reduction in income tax expense in the amount of million or percent of pre tax income related to research and development tax credits 
in addition  there was a reduction in income tax expense in the amount of million or percent which was primarily due to the reversal of certain unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of certain statutes of limitations 
these items were partially offset by an increase in tax expense in the amount of million or percent related to additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets for state net operating losses 
our lower taxable income level generated a more significant impact on the effective tax rate for these items
