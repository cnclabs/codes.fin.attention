item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated statements of operations contained in the consolidated financial statements  including trends which might appear  should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
executive summary kimco realty corporation is one of the nation s largest publicly traded owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers 
as of december   the company had interests in properties  totaling approximately million square feet of gla located in states  puerto rico  canada  mexico  chile  brazil and peru 
the company is self administered and self managed through present management  which has owned and managed neighborhood and community shopping centers for over years 
the executive officers are engaged in the day to day management and operation of real estate exclusively with the company  with nearly all operating functions  including leasing  asset management  maintenance  construction  legal  finance and accounting  administered by the company 
the company s vision is to be the premier owner and operator of retail shopping centers with its core business operations focusing on owning and operating neighborhood and community shopping centers through equity investments in north america 
this vision will entail a shift away from certain non strategic assets that the company currently holds 
these investments include non retail preferred equity investments  marketable securities  mortgages on non retail properties and several urban mixed use properties 
the company s plan is to sell certain non strategic assets and investments 
the company realizes that the sale of these assets will be over a period of time given the current unfavorable market conditions 
in order to execute the company s vision  the company s strategy is to continue to strengthen its balance sheet by pursuing deleveraging efforts  providing it the necessary flexibility to invest opportunistically and selectively  primaril y focusing on neighborhood and community shopping centers 
in addition  the company continues to be dedicated to building its institutional management business by forming joint ventures with high quality domestic and foreign institutional partners for the purpose of investing in neighborhood and community shopping centers 
the company continually evaluates its debt maturities  and  based on management s current assessment  believes it has viable financing and refinancing alternatives that will not materially adversely impact its expected financial results 
although the credit environment remains volatile  the company continues to pursue opportunities with large commercial us and global banks  select life insurance companies and certain regional and local banks 
the company has noticed a trend that the approval process from mortgage lenders has slowed  while pricing and loan to value ratios remain dependent on specific deal terms  in general  spreads are higher and loan to values are lower  but the lenders are continuing to complete financing agreements 
during the second half of  the unsecured public debt markets became accessible for certain reits and the company successfully issued million year unsecured senior notes 
moreover  the company continues t o assess and beyond to ensure the company is prepared if the current credit market dislocation continues 
the retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions 
these conditions have forced some weaker retailers  in some cases  to declare bankruptcy and or close stores 
certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection 
however  any of these particular store closings affecting the company often represent a small percentage of the company s overall gross leasable area and the company does not currently expect store closings to have a material adverse effect on the company s overall performance 
the decline in market conditions has also had a negative effect on real estate transactional activity as it relates to the acquisition and sale of real estate assets 
the company believes that the lack of real estate transactions will most likely continue throughout which may curtail the company s growth in the near term 
during  the company recognized non cash impairment charges of approximately million  before income taxes and noncontrolling interest  relating to adjustments to property carrying values  investments in real estate joint ventures  real estate under development and other real estate investments 
ongoing adverse market and economic conditions could cause us to recognize additional impairments in the future 

table of contents critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of the company  its wholly owned subsidiaries and all entities in which the company has a controlling interest  including where the company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the consolidation guidance of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 
the company applies these provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the cost  equity or consolidation method of accounting is appropriate 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has m ade its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates are based on  but not limited to  historical results  industry standards and current economic conditions  giving due consideration to materiality 
the most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable  depreciable lives  valuation of real estate and intangible assets and liabilities  valuation of joint venture investments  marketable securities and other investments and realizability of deferred tax assets 
application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties  and  as a result  actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties  investments in joint ventures  marketable securities and other investments 
the company s reported net earnings is directly affected by management s estimate of impairments and or valuation allowances 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases 
certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee 
these percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved 
operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned 
rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements 
in addition  leases typically provide for reimbursement to the company of common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other operating expenses 
the company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents  expense reimbursements and other revenues 
the company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims 
the company s reported net earnings is directly affected by management s estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable 
real estate the company s investments in real estate properties are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
significant renovations and replacements  which improve and extend the life of the asset  are capitalized 
upon acquisition of real estate operating properties  the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land  building  building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and below market leases  in place leases and tenant relationships  assumed debt and redeemable units issued at the date of acquisition  based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date 
based on these estimates  the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities 
fair value is determined based on an exit price approach  which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
if  up to one year from the acquisition date  information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined  appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis 
the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred 

table of contents depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  as follows buildings and building improvements to years fixtures  leasehold and tenant improvements terms of leases or useful including certain identified intangible assets lives  whichever is shorter the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net earnings 
real estate under development on the company s consolidated balance sheets represents ground up development of neighborhood and community shopping center projects which may be subsequently sold upon completion or which the company may hold as long term investments 
these assets are carried at cost 
the cost of land and buildings under development includes specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs incurred during the period of development 
the company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity 
a gain on the sale of these assets is generally recognized using the fu ll accrual method in accordance with the provisions of the fasb s real estate sales guidance 
on a continuous basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators  including property operating performance and general market conditions  that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may be impaired 
a property value is considered impaired only if management s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property 
such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 
when a real estate asset is identified by management as held for sale  the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs 
if  in management s opinion  the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset  an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence  but does not control  these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions 
earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and  where applicable  are based upon an allocation of the investment s net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period 
the company s joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of co investments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties  consistent with its core business 
these joint ventures typically obtain non recourse third party financing on their property investments  thus contractually limiting the company s exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment  and  due to the lender s exposure to losses  a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk 
the company s exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments 
the company  on a selective basis  obtains unsecured financing for certain joint ventures 
these unsecured financings are guaranteed by the company with guarantees from the joint venture partners for their proportionate amount s of any guaranty payment the company is obligated to make 
on a continuous basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators  including property operating performance and general market conditions  that the value of the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired 
an investment s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other than temporary 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment 

table of contents the company s estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each specific property that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period 
capitalization rates  discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for each respective property 
marketable securities the company classifies its existing marketable equity securities as available for sale in accordance with the fasb s investments debt and equity securities guidance 
these securities are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income oci 
gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method 
all debt securities are generally classified as held to maturity because the company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
held to maturity securities are stated at amortized cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
debt securities which contain conversion features are generally classified as available for sale 
on a continuous basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s marketable securities may be impaired 
a marketable security is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than the carrying value of the security and such difference is deemed to be other than temporary 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the security over the estimated fair value in the security 
realizability of deferred tax assets the company is subject to federal  state and local income taxes on the income from its trs activities  which include kimco realty services krs  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and the consolidated entities of fnc realty corporation fnc and blue ridge real estate company big boulder corporation  blue ridge 
the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 
a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required  if based on the evidence available  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed 
information about an enterprise s current financial position and its results of operations for the current and preceding years is supplemented by all currently available information about future years 
sometimes  however  historical information may not be as relevant for example  if there has been a significant  recent change in circumstances and special attention is required 
future realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference or carryforward ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example  ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback or carryforward period available under the tax law 
the following four possible sources of taxable income may be available under the tax law to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards 
these include i future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  ii future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  iii taxable income in prior carrybackyear s if carry back is permitted under the relevant tax law and iv tax planning strategies that would  if necessary  be implemented 
evidence available about each of those possible sources of taxable income will vary for different tax jurisdictions and  possibly  from year to year 
to the extent evidence about one or more sources of taxable income is sufficient to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary  other sources need not be considered 
consideration of each source is required  however  to determine the amount of the valuation allowance that is recognized for deferred tax assets 

table of contents the company must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists a the more positive evidence is necessary and b the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
as of december   the company had net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
this net deferred tax asset includes approximately million for the tax effect of net operating losses  nol after the impact of a valuation allowance of million  relating to fnc  a consolidated entity in which the company has a ownership interest 
the partial valuation allowance on the fnc deferred tax asset primarily results from current projected taxable income  being more likely than not  insufficient to utilize the full amount of the deferred tax asset 
the company s remaining net deferred tax asset of approximately million primarily relates to krs and consists of i million in deferred tax liabilities  ii million in nol carryforwards that expire in  iii million in tax credit carryforwards  million of which expire in and million that do not expire and iv million primarily relating to difference s in gaap book basis and tax basis of accounting for i real estate assets ii real estate joint ventures  iii other real estate investments  and iv asset impairments charges that have been recorded for book purposes but not yet recognized for tax purposes and v other miscellaneous deductible temporary differences 
as of december   the company determined that no valuation allowance was needed against the million net deferred tax asset within krs 
this determination was based upon the company s analysis of both positive evidence  which includes future projected income for krs and negative evidence  which consists of a three year cumulative pretax book loss of approximately million for krs 
the cumulative loss was primarily the result of significant impairment charges taken by krs during and of approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
krs has a strong earnings history exclusive of the impairment charges 
since  krs has produced substantial taxable income in each year through over the prior three years through krs generated approximately million of taxable income  before net operating loss carryovers 
to determine future projected income the company scheduled krs s pre tax book income and taxable income over a twenty year period taking into account its continuing operations core earnings 
core earnings consist of estimated net operating income for properties currently in service and generating rental income from existing tenants 
major lease turnover is not expected in these properties as these properties were generally constructed and leased within the past two years 
to allow the forecast to remain objective and verifiable  no income growth was forecasted for any other aspect of krs s continuing business activities including its investment in the albertson s joint venture 
the company also included future known events in its projected income forecast such as the maturity of certain mortgages and construction loans which will significantly reduce the amount of interest expense incurred in future years 
additionally  the company has also committed t o certain actions which will result in reducing leverage at krs 
with the company s change in its merchant building strategy  future business operations at krs will not support its current capital structure which consists of approximately million of intercompany loans the company has made to krs to fund its merchant building operation 
krs incurred approximately million of interest expense related to the intercompany financing during the company will recapitalize a significant portion of the debt to reflect krs s ongoing business activities 
the twenty year taxable income estimate reduces intercompany interest in accordance with this plan 
the company s projection of krs s future taxable income  utilizing the assumptions above with respect to core earnings and reductions in interest expense due to debt maturities and the company s recapitalization plans  generates approximately million in future taxable income which is sufficient to fully utilize krs s million net deferred tax asset 
as a result of this analysis the company has determined it is more likely than not that krs s net deferred tax asset of million will be realized and therefore  no valuation allowance is needed at december  if future income projections do not occur as forecasted or the company incurs additional impairment losses  the company will reevaluate the need for a valuation allowance 
results of operations increase decrease change all amounts in millions revenues from rental property rental property expenses rent real estate taxes operating and maintenance depreciation and amortization 
table of contents revenues from rental property increased primarily from the combined effect of i the acquisition of operating properties during and  providing incremental revenues for the year ended december  of million  as compared to the corresponding period in and ii the completion of certain development and redevelopment projects and tenant buyouts providing incremental revenues of approximately million  for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in  which was partially offset by iii a decrease in revenues of approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in  primarily resulting from the sale of certain properties during and  and iv an overall occupancy decrease from the consolidated shopping center portfolio from at december  to at december  rental property expenses increased primarily due to i operating property acquisitions during and  ii the placement of certain development properties into service  which resulted in lower capitalization of carry costs  and iii an increase in snow removal costs during as compared to  partially offset by iv a decrease in insurance costs during as compared to and v operating property dispositions during and depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to i operating property acquisitions during and  ii the placement of certain development properties into service and iii tenant vacates  partially offset by operating property dispositions during and mortgage and other financing income decreased million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the corresponding period in this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in interest income during resulting from the repayment of certain mortgage receivables during and management and other fee income decreased approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in property management fees of approximately million for  due to lower revenues attributable to lower occupancy and the sale of certain properties during and  partially offset by an increase in other transaction related fees of approximately million recognized during general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in force during as a result of implementing the company s core business strategy of focusing on owning and operating shopping centers and a shift away from certain non strategic assets along with a lack of transactional activity 
interest  dividends and other investment income decreased approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in this decrease is primarily due to i a decrease in realized gains of approximately million during resulting from the sale of certain marketable securities during the corresponding period in as compared to  and ii a decrease in interest and dividend income of approximately million during  as compared to the corresponding period in  primarily resulting from the sale of investments in marketable securities and reductions in dividends declared from certain marketable securities during and other expense  net decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the corresponding period in this decrease is primarily due to i the receipt of fewer shares of sears holding corp

these sales resulted in gains of approximately million  after income taxes of million 
during  the company recognized non cash impairment charges of approximately million  before income taxes and noncontrolling interest  relating to adjustments to property carrying values  investments in real estate joint ventures  real estate under development and other real estate investments 
the company s estimated fair values relating to these impairment assessments were based upon discounted cash flow models that included all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and where applicable  any estimated debt premiums 
these cash flows are comprised of unobservable inputs which include contractual rental revenues and forecasted rental revenues and expenses based upon market conditions and expectations for growth 
capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models were based upon observable rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective properties 
based on t hese inputs the company determined that its valuation in these investments was classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
approximately million of the total non cash impairment charges for the year ended december   were due to the decline in value of certain marketable equity securities and other investments that were deemed to be other than temporary 
for the year ended december   the company recognized non cash impairment charges of approximately million  before income tax benefit of approximately million 
approximately million of the total non cash impairment charges for the year ended december   were due to the decline in value of certain marketable equity securities and other investments that were deemed to be other than temporary 
the company will continue to assess the value of all its assets on an on going basis 
based on these assessments  the company may determine that a decline in value for one or more of its investments may be other than temporary or permanent and would therefore write down its cost basis accordingly 
benefit for income taxes increased by million for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in this change is primarily due to i a decrease in the tax provision expense of approximately million from equity income recognized in connection with the albertson s investment during the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in and ii a decrease in the income tax provision expense of approximately million in connection with gains on sale of development properties during as compared to  partially offset by a decrease in income tax benefit of approximately million related to impairments taken during the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding period in equity in income of real estate joint ventures  net for the year ended december   was approximately million as compared to million for the corresponding period in this reduction of approximately million is primarily the result of i an increase in the recognition of non cash impairment charges against the carrying value of the company s investment in unconsolidated joint ventures of approximately million recorded during  as compared to the corresponding period in  primarily due to an increase in impairments of approximately million recognized by the kimpru joint ventures  ii the recognition of approximately million of equity in income from the albertson s joint venture during  as compared to million of equity in income recognized during resulting from the sale of properties in the joint venture  iii a decrease in income related to the recognition of approximately million in income result ing from cash distributions received in excess of the company s carrying value of its investment in various unconsolidated limited liability partnerships during the corresponding period in  iv a decrease in income of million during  from a joint venture which holds interests in extended stay residential properties primarily due to overall decreases in occupancy  v a decrease in profit participation of approximately million during  as compared to the corresponding period in  resulting from the sale transfer of operating properties from two joint venture investments  vi a decrease in income of approximately million during  from a canadian joint venture investment  primarily due to an overall decrease in occupancy and vii a decrease in occupancy levels within certain real estate joint venture investments  partially offset by increased gains on sales of approximately million during the year ended december   resulting from the sale of operating pr operties during  as compared to

effects of inflation many of the company s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above pre determined thresholds  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the 
table of contents consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than years  which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance costs  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
the company periodically evaluates its exposure to short term interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will  from time to time  enter into interest rate protection agreements and or foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
market and economic conditions  real estate and retail shopping sector in the us  market and economic conditions have remained challenging 
although credit conditions have improved from the prior year  they remain volatile 
during  continued concerns about the systemic impact of the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and fluctuations in the real estate markets have contributed to continued market volatility and diminished expectations for the us economy 
these conditions  combined with low levels of business and consumer confidence and high unemployment have contributed to volatility and little to no growth in the us and international economies 
historically  real estate has been subject to a wide range of cyclical economic conditions that affect various real estate markets and geographic regions with differing intensities and at different times 
different regions of the united states have and may continue to experience varying degrees of economic growth or distress 
adverse changes in general or local economic conditions could result in the inability of some tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company s ability to attract or retain tenants 
the company s shopping centers are typically anchored by two or more national tenants who generally offer day to day necessities  rather than high priced luxury items 
in addition  the company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through ownership of a portfolio of properties with a diverse geographic and tenant base 
the company monitors potential credit issues of its tenants  and analyzes the possible effects to the financial statements of the company and its unconsolidated joint ventures 
in addition to the collectability assessment of outstanding accounts receivable  the company evaluates the related real estate for recoverability as well as any tenant related deferred charges for recoverability  which may include straight line rents  deferred lease costs  tenant improvements  tenant inducements and intangible assets 
the retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions  particularly in the western united states primarily california 
these conditions may result in the company s tenants delaying lease commencements or declining to extend or renew leases upon expiration 
these conditions also have forced some weaker retailers  in some cases  to declare bankruptcy and or close stores 
certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection 
however  any of these particular store closings affecting the company often represent a small percentage of the company s overall gross leasable area and the company does not currently expect store closings to have a material adverse effect on the company s overall performance 
the decline in market conditions has also had a negative effect on real estate transactional activity as it relates to the acquisition and sale of real estate assets 
the company believes that the lack of real estate transactions will continue throughout  which will curtail the company s growth in the near term
