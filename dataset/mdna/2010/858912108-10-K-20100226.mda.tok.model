item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item of this report 
introduction we are in the business of managing regulated waste and providing an array of related services 
we operate in the united states  canada  argentina  chile  mexico  ireland  portugal  romania  and the united kingdom 
for large quantity generators of regulated waste such as hospitals and for pharmaceutical companies and distributors  we offer our institutional regulated waste management services  our bio systems sharps management services to reduce the risk of needle sticks  a variety of products and services for infection control  and our regulated returns and waste management services for expired or recalled products 
for small quantity generators of regulated waste such as doctors offices and for retail pharmacies  we offer our medical and regulated waste management services  our steri safe osha and hipaa compliance programs  a variety of products and services for infection control  and our regulated returns services for expired or recalled products 
we operate integrated national regulated waste management networks in the united states  canada  argentina  chile  mexico  ireland  portugal  romania  and the united kingdom 
our national networks include a total of processing or combined processing and collection sites and additional transfer  collection or combined transfer and collection sites 
our regulated waste processing technologies include autoclaving  our proprietary etd  chemical treatment  and incineration 
as of december   we served approximately  customers worldwide  of which approximately  were small quantity customers and  were large quantity customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and 
table of contents judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  the following ones may involve a higher degree of judgment on our part and greater complexity of reporting 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues for our regulated waste services at the time of waste collection 
payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided 
revenues from regulated returns management services are recorded at the time services are performed 
revenues from product sales are recognized at the time the goods are shipped to the customer 
software licensing revenues are recognized on a prorated basis over the term of the license agreement 
we do not have any contracts in a loss position 
losses would be recorded when known and estimable for any contracts that should go into a loss position 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is not amortized 
we have determined that our permits have indefinite lives and  accordingly  are not amortized see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our balance sheet at december  contains goodwill of billion 
in accordance with accounting standards  we evaluate on at least an annual basis  using the fair value of reporting units  whether goodwill is impaired 
if we were to determine that a significant impairment has occurred  we would be required to incur non cash write offs of the impaired portion of goodwill that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write off occurs 
we use the market value of our stock compared to book as the current measurement of total fair value of our company 
the performance of each of our reporting units is compared to that fair value ratio  and any unforeseen material drop in our stock price may be an indicator of a potential impairment of goodwill 
the results of the impairment test conducted in june did not show any impairment of goodwill  and no events have occurred since that time that indicates that an impairment situation exists 
our permits are tested for impairment annually at december or more frequently if circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
we use a discounted income approach model as the current measurement of the fair value of the permits 
the estimate of income is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by management 
our estimates of discounted income may differ from actual income due to  among other things  inaccuracies in economic estimates 
the results of the impairment test did not show any impairment of our permits and no events have occurred since that time that would indicate an impairment situation exists 
other identifiable intangible assets  such as customer relationships  tradenames  and covenants not to compete  are currently amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we have determined that our regulated waste customer relationships have between year and year lives based on the specific type of relationship 
this determination was based on an independent study performed on our customer relationships 
although the regulated waste management business is highly competitive  we have been able to maintain high customer retention through contracts with automatic renewal provisions and excellent customer service 
the valuation of our contractual customer relationships was derived using a discounted income approach valuation model similar to the method used for permit impairment testing mentioned earlier 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be less than its undiscounted estimated future cash flows 
there have been no indicators of impairment of these intangibles see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
we compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
significant judgments are required in order to determine the realizability of these deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence  including historical operating results  estimates of future taxable income and the existence of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
changes in the expectations regarding the realization of deferred tax assets could materially impact income tax expense in future periods 
to provide for certain potential tax exposures  we maintain a reserve for specific tax contingencies  the balance of which management believes is adequate 
accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
accounts receivable balances are determined to be delinquent when the amount is past due based on the contractual terms with the customer 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts 
accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when we have determined that the receivable will not be collected and or when the account has been referred to a third party collection agency 
no single customer accounts for more than of our revenues 
insurance our insurance for workers compensation  vehicle liability and physical damage  and employee related health care benefits is obtained using high deductible insurance policies 
a third party administrator is used to process all such claims 
we require all workers compensation  vehicle liability and physical damage claims to be reported within hours 
as a result  we accrue our workers compensation  vehicle and physical damage liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator at the end of each reporting period 
our employee health insurance benefit liability is based on our historical claims experience rate 
our earnings would be impacted to the extent that actual claims vary from historical experience 
we review our accruals associated with the exposure to these liabilities for adequacy at the end of each reporting period 
litigation we operate in a highly regulated industry and deal with regulatory inquiries or investigations from time to time that may be instituted for a variety of reasons 
we are also involved in a variety of civil litigation from time to time 
settlements from litigation would be recorded when known  probable and estimable 
stock option plans we have issued stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of our compensation programs 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating expected volatility  expected term and risk free rate 
our expected volatility is based upon historical experience 
the expected term of the stock options is based upon a measure of historical volatility of our stock price 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the us treasury yield rates of a comparable period 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
new accounting pronouncements for information about recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fair value considerations financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment  and may affect the valuation of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels 
the impact of our creditworthiness has been considered in the fair value measurements noted below 
in addition  the fair value measurement of a liability must reflect the nonperformance risk of an entity 

table of contents at december   we have million in cash and cash equivalents and million of short term investments that we carry on our books at fair value using level inputs 
at december   we have two interest rate swap contracts  covering million of our borrowings outstanding under our term loan facility 
the objective of the swap is to reduce the risk of volatile interest expense by fixing the rate 
the fair value of the hedge is calculated using level inputs and is recorded as a current liability of million 
the fair value was determined using market data inputs to calculate expected future interest rates 
the cash streams attributable to the difference between expected future rates and the fixed rate payable is discounted to arrive at the fair value of the two hedges 
as part of our acquisition accounting  we assign fair values to identifiable intangible assets  primarily customer relationships and operating permits 
we use a discounted income approach whereby the expected after tax cash flows of the acquired entity are present valued 
we use the financial information provided by the acquired company  and management assumptions related to future growth to determine expected future cash flows 
we use data provided by unaffiliated external parties as well as internal financial information to calculate a weighted average cost of capital wacc for the acquired company 
the expected cash flows and the calculated wacc are significant inputs in determining the fair value of our intangibles 
during  we assigned million to customer relationships and million to facility environmental permits using level inputs 
restructuring costs in december of  we announced the consolidation of operations within our returns management services business 
this consolidation will result in the closure of our facilities in boynton beach  florida and conyers  georgia 
the operations of those facilities will be moved to our indianapolis  indiana location 
we have recognized million in expense during the fourth quarter of related to this restructuring  of which million was fixed asset write offs and was primarily severance  which will be paid during we estimate an additional million in expense during of which approximately million will be related to severance and other employee expenses  and million will be related to lease and related occupancy charges 
we expect that our restructuring will be completed by the end of we believe this restructuring will allow us to maximize the efficiency of our returns management services business at a single location and management infrastructure
