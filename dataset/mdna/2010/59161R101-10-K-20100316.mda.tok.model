the bank the bank became a state chartered bank on november   following approval by the pennsylvania department of banking of the bank s application to convert from a national bank charter to a state bank charter 
as a nationally chartered bank  the bank had been subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency 
the bank is now supervised jointly by the pennsylvania department of banking and the fdic 
the bank has applied to be a member of the federal reserve system 
the bank s deposits are insured by the fdic up to applicable legal limits 
some of the aspects of the lending and deposit business of the bank that are regulated by these agencies include personal lending  mortgage lending and reserve requirements 
the bank is also subject to numerous federal  state and local law s and regulations which set forth specific restrictions and procedural requirements with respect to the payment of dividends to the company  extension of credit  credit practices  the disclosure of credit terms and discrimination in credit transactions

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of the usa patriot act imposes additional obligations on us financial institutions  including banks  to implement policies  procedures and controls  which are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism 
in addition  provisions of the usa patriot act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti money laundering activities when reviewing bank applications 
the emergency economic stabilization act of  signed into law on october   authorized the secretary of the us department of the treasury treasury to establish the troubled assets relief program tarp to purchase troubled assets 
troubled assets are broadly defined to include residential or commercial mortgages and any securities  obligations or other instruments that are based on  or related to  such mortgages  also included are financial instruments the treasury determined to purchase in order to promote financial market stability 
pursuant to the tarp  the treasury established the capital purchase program cpp through which it made capital investments in banking institutions in order to strengthen and stabilize us financial institutions 
the bank did not participate in the tarp o r the cpp in or also in october  the fdic announced the temporary liquidity guaranty program  a new guarantee program designed to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks  thrifts  and certain holding companies  and by providing full coverage of noninterest bearing deposit transaction accounts  regardless of dollar amount 
the bank is participating in a component of the fdic s temporary liquidity guaranty program called the transaction account guarantee program tagp

coverage under the transaction account guarantee program is in addition to and separate from the coverage available under the fdic s gener al deposit insurance rules

national monetary policy in addition to being affected by general economic conditions  the earnings and growth of the company are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities  including the pennsylvania department of banking  the frb and the fdic 
an important function of the frb is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions 
among the instruments used to implement these objectives are open market operations in us government securities  setting the discount rate  and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits 
these instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of credit  bank loans  investments and deposits  and their use may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits 
the monetary policies and regulations of the frb have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the effects of such policies upon the future business  earnings  and growth of the company cannot be predicted

risk factors the company s financial results are subject to a number of risks 
the factors discussed below highlight risks that management believes are most relevant to the company s current operations 
this list does not capture all risks associated with the company s business 
additional risks  including those that generally affect the banking and financial services industries and those that management currently believes are immaterial may also negatively impact the company s liquidity  financial position  or results of operations 
we may be required to make further increases in our provisions for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could materially adversely affect us 
there is no precise method of predicting loan losses 
we can give no assurance that our allowance for loan losses is or will be sufficient to absorb actual loan losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense  that represents management s best estimate of probable incurred losses within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions  industry concentrations and other unidentified losses inherent in the c urrent loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses 
increases in nonperforming loans have a significant impact on our allowance for loan losses 
if current trends in the real estate markets continue  we could continue to experience increased delinquencies and credit losses  particularly with respect to real estate construction loans  land acquisition and development loans and one to four family residential mortgage loans 
moreover  we expect that the current recession may continue to negatively impact economic conditions in our market areas and that we could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase the provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge offs  based on judgments that differ from those of management 
if loan charge offs in future periods exceed our allowance for loan losses  we will need to record additional provisions to increase our allowance for loan losses 
furthermore  growth in our loan portfolio would generally lead to an increase in the provision for loan losses 
any increases in our allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and capital  and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our earnings and financial condition may be negatively impacted by a continued downturn in the economy of south central pennsylvania 
metro s business is concentrated in south central pennsylvania 
our earnings and financial condition are dependent upon the growth in businesses  population  income  deposits and housing in this geographic area 
in the previous twelve months  south central pennsylvania has seen the opening of few businesses  the closing of manufacturing properties and offices and continued layoffs of personnel 
because of the concentration of our business in this region  we are unable to spread the risks of the slow economy over a large geographic area 
while we experienced an growth in our total deposits in  a continued slowdown in the economy could slow that growth in and otherwise adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
changes in the credit risk of our borrowers could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our results of operations and financial condition are affected by the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans 
lending money is an essential part of the banking business 
however  borrowers do not always repay their loans 
the risk of non payment is affected by changes in economic conditions  the credit risks of a particular borrower  the duration of the loan and in the case of a collateralized loan  uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral and other factors 
consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans 
while we intend to maintain a prudent approach to extending credit by undertaking due diligence and credit scoring to determine the risk of each credit application  there can be no guarantee that these measures will be sufficient to mitigate our exposure to credit risk 
if we fail to adequately manage our credit risk  we could be materially and adversely affected 
our high percentage of commercial loans presents a great risk of non payment 
generally  commercial industrial  construction and commercial real estate loans present a greater risk of non payment by a borrower than other types of loans 
commercial and commercial real estate loans comprised and  respectively  of our loan portfolio at december  the market value of real estate  particularly real estate held for investment  can fluctuate significantly in a relatively short period of time 
in addition  the economic downturn has caused several businesses to close 
if the value of the real estate or other business assets serving as collateral for our loan portfolio were to decline materially  a significant part of our loan portfolio could become under collateralized  resulting in a material adverse effect on our provision for loan losses and on our operating results 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by other than temporary impairment charges relating to our investment portfolio 
we may be required to record future impairment charges on our investment securities if they suffer declines in value that we determine are other than temporary 
numerous factors  including the lack of liquidity for re sales of certain investment securities  the absence of reliable pricing information for investment securities  adverse changes in the business climate  adverse regulatory actions or unanticipated changes in the competitive environment  could have a negative effect on our investment portfolio in future periods 
if an impairment charge is significant enough  it could affect the ability of the bank to pay dividends to us  which could materially adversely affect us and our ability to pay dividends to shareholders 
significant impairment charges could also negatively impact our regulatory capital ratios and result in us not be ing classified as well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
we plan to continue to grow rapidly and there are risks associated with rapid growth 
prior to  we experienced significant growth in net income  assets  loans and deposits 
in  we had a increase in core deposits and an increase in total deposits 
our growth has been achieved through organic growth 
we intend to continue to expand our business and operations in our existing central pennsylvania footprint as well as open new stores in metro philadelphia 
subject to regulatory approvals  we are targeting to open to new stores over the next five years 
we anticipate the cost to construct and furnish a new store will be approximately million  excluding the cost to lease or purchase the land on which the store is located 
our ability to manage growth successfully will depend on our ability to attract qualified personnel and maintain cost controls and asset quality while attracting additional loans and deposits on favorable terms  as well as on factors beyond our control  such as economic conditions and competition 
if we grow too quickly and are not able to attract qualified personnel  control costs and maintain asset quality  this continued rapid growth could materially adversely affect us 
growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
we anticipate that our existing capital will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
in september  we completed a successful common stock offering which raised nearly million 
this additional capital provides the foundation for aggressive store growth  both de novo and through acquisitions of existing banks 
however  we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support continued growth 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on various matters  including our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations  as well as on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside of our control 
the current financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets  which has resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise additional capital 
accordingly  we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  on favorable terms  or at all 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth  branching and or acquisitions could be materially impaired 
we may be temporarily adversely affected by the termination of the merger agreement with republic first bancorp  inc republic first 
we focused on the planned acquisition of republic first for over a year 
now  we must slightly adjust our growth strategy 
the acquisition of republic first would have given us an immediate increase in total assets to over billion 
it would have also allowed us to immediately expand into the major financial markets of philadelphia and southern new jersey and compete more effectively with local and regional commercial banks with greater assets  capital and larger lending limits than that of the bank 
it will take time and human resources to adjust our strategy for expansion into these markets 
in addition  our planned expansion into counties in the metro philadelphia region may be more difficult without the acquisition of republic first 
unfavorable economic and market conditions due to the current global financial crisis may materially and adversely affect us 
economic and market conditions in the united states and around the world have deteriorated significantly and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future 
conditions such as slowing or negative growth and the sub prime debt devaluation crisis have resulted in a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in credit  equity and fixed income markets 
these economic developments could have various effects on us  including insolvency of major customers and a negative impact on the investment income we are able to earn on our investment portfolio 
the potential effects of the current global financial crisis are difficult to forecast and mitigate 
as a consequence  our operating results for a particular period are difficult to predict 
distress in the credit markets and issues relating to liquidity among financial institutions have resulted in the failure of some financial institutions around the world and others have been forced to seek acquisition partners 
the united states and other governments have taken unprecedented steps in efforts to stabilize the financial system  including investing in financial institutions 
there can be no assurance that these efforts will succeed 
we could be materially adversely affected by continued or accelerated disruption and volatility in financial markets  continued capital and liquidity concerns regarding financial institutions  limitations resulting from further governmen tal action in an effort to continue the stabilization or provide additional regulation of the financial system  or recessionary conditions that are deeper or longer lasting than currently anticipated 
we cannot assure you that any governmental action would benefit us 
we must continue to attract and retain qualified personnel and maintain cost controls and asset quality 
our ability to manage growth successfully will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain management experienced in banking and financial services and familiar with the communities in our market area 
as we grow  we must be able to attract and retain qualified additional management and loan officers with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about our market areas to implement our operating strategy 
the unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel  or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future  could materially adversely affect us 
if we grow too quickly and are not able to attract qualified personnel and maintain cost controls and asset quality  this continued rapid growth could materially adversely affect us 
we may be adversely affected by lawsuits alleging trademark infringement 
on or about june   we changed our name and the name of the bank and began using the red m logo 
several companies in the united states  including companies in the banking and financial services industries  use variations of the word metro and the letter m as part of a trademark or trade name 
as such  we face potential objections to our use of these marks 
on or about june   members st federal credit union  or members st  filed a complaint in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania against metro bancorp  inc  metro bank  republic first and republic first bank 
members st s claims are for federal trademark infringement  federal unfair competition  and common law trademark infringement and unfair competition 
it is members st s assertion that metro s use of a red letter m alone  or in conjunction with its trade name metro  purportedly infringes members st s federally registered and common law trademark for the mark mst stylized 
metro intends to defend the case vigorously 
the complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount and inj unctive relief 
in light of the preliminary state of the proceeding  it is not possible to assess potential costs and damages if members st were to be successful in the proceeding 
any costs and damages could materially adversely affect us 
changes in interest rates could reduce our net income and liquidity 
our operating income  net income and liquidity depend to a great extent on our net interest margin  ie  the difference between the interest yields we receive on loans  securities and other interest earning assets and the interest rates we pay on interest bearing deposits  borrowings and other liabilities 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control  including competition  general economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities  including the board of governors of the federal reserve system  or the frb 
if the rate of interest we pay on our interest bearing deposits  borrowings and other liabilities increases more than the rate of interest we receive on loans  securities and other interest earning assets  our net interest income  and therefore our earnings  and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
our earnings and liquidity could also be materially adversely affected if the rates on ou r loans  securities and other investments fall more quickly than those on our deposits  borrowings and other liabilities 
our operations are subject to risks and uncertainties surrounding our exposure to change in interest rate environment 
we operate in a highly regulated environment  changes in laws and regulations and accounting principles may materially adversely affect us 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision  and legislation which govern almost all aspects of our operations 
the laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time and are primarily intended for the protection of customers  depositors and the deposit insurance funds 
any changes to these laws  regulations or any applicable accounting principles may materially adversely affect us 
the current debate in the united states congress over how high bank reserves should be kept in order to guard against unexpected losses could result in higher reserve requirements and a decrease in our net income and capital 
moreover  congress is reviewing proposals to overhaul the regulation of banks and bank holding companies 
while we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us  these changes could be materially adverse to us 
competition from other banks and financial institutions in originating loans  attracting deposits and providing various financial services may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 
we have substantial competition in originating loans  both commercial and consumer in our market area 
this competition comes principally from other banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking companies and other lenders 
several of our competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources and access to capital  stronger regulatory ratios  and higher lending limits  a wider geographic presence  more accessible branch office locations  more aggressive marketing campaigns  better brand recognition  the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives  as well as lower origination and operating costs 
this competition could reduce our net income and liquidity by decreasing the number and size of loans that the bank originates and the interest rates we may charge on the se loans 
the same competitor advantages listed above exist in attempting to attract business and consumer deposits 
the bank faces substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks  savings institutions and credit unions  as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives  including money market funds 
these competitors may offer higher interest rates than the bank  which could decrease the deposits that the bank attracts or require the bank to increase its rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits 
increased deposit competition could materially adversely affect our ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations 
as a result  we may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase our cost of funds 
our share price may fluctuate 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to many factors  including  but not limited to actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations  liquidity or financial condition  changes in our earnings estimates or those of analysts  our failure to pay dividends on common stock  publication of research reports about us or the banking industry generally  changes in market valuations of similar companies  the effects of  and changes in  trade  monetary and fiscal policies  including interest rate policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  general economic or business conditions  either nationally  regionally or in the communities in which either we do business  may be less favorable than expected  resulting in  among other things  a deterioration in credit quality and loan performance or a reduced demand for credit  continued levels of loan quality and volume origination  the adequacy of loan loss reserves  the impact of changes in financial services laws and regulations including laws concerning taxes  banking  securities and insurance  the willingness of customers to substitute competitors products and services for our products and services and vice versa  based on price  quality  relationship or otherwise  unanticipated regulatory or judicial proceedings and liabilities and other costs  interest rate  market and monetary fluctuations  the timely development of competitive new products and services by us and the acceptance of such products and services by customers  changes in consumer spending and saving habits relative to the financial services we provide  the loss of certain key officers or other employees  continued relationships with major customers  our ability to continue to grow our business internally and through acquisition and successful integration of new or acquired entities while controlling costs  compliance with laws and regulatory requirements of federal  state and local agencies  the ability to hedge certain risks economically  effect of terrorist attacks and threats of actual war  deposit flows  changes in accounting principles  policies and guidelines  rapidly changing technology  other economic  competitive  governmental  regulatory and technological factors affecting the company s operations  pricing  products and services  and our success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing 
stock markets  in general  have experienced over the past year  and continue to experience  significant price and volume volatility  and the market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations that may be unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
increased market volatility could result in a substantial decline in the market price of our common stock 
our common stock is not insured by any governmental entity and  therefore  an investment in our common stock involves risk 
our common stock is not a deposit account or other obligation of any bank  and is not insured by the fdic or any other governmental entity  and is subject to investment risk  including possible loss 
there may be future sales of our common stock  which may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we issued million shares of our common stock in a public offering in september we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock  including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock 
additionally  the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock  whether directly by us or by existing common stockholders in the secondary market  the perception that such sales could occur or the availability for future sale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock could  in turn  materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity related securities 
in addition  we may issue other equity securities that are senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons  including  without limitation  to support operations and growth  to maintain our capital ratios and to comply with any future changes in regulatory standards 
our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq global select market 
during the twelve months ended december   the average daily trading volume for our common stock was approximately  shares 
as a result  sales of our common stock may place significant downward pressure on the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  it may be difficult for holders to resell their shares at prices they find attractive  or at all 
our common stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and preferred stock and effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and preferred equity claims against our subsidiaries 
shares of our common stock are common equity interests in us and  as such  will rank junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities 
additionally  holders of our common stock are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our outstanding preferred stock 
our board of directors is authorized to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of the holders of our common stock 
furthermore  our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon any of our subsidiaries liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary s creditors and preferred stockholders 
our ability to pay dividends depends upon the results of operations of our subsidiaries 
neither the company nor the bank has declared or paid cash dividends on its common stock since the bank began operations in june our board of directors intends to follow a policy of retaining earnings for the purpose of increasing the company s and the bank s capital for the foreseeable future 
although the board of directors anticipates establishing a cash dividend policy in the future  no assurance can be given that cash dividends will be paid 
holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends if  as and when declared from time to time by our board of directors in its sole discretion out of funds legally available for that purpose  after debt service payments and payments of dividends required to be paid on our outstanding preferred stock  if any 
while we are not subject to certain restrictions on dividends applicable to a bank  our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock will depend to a large extent upon the amount of dividends paid by the bank to us 
regulatory authorities restrict the amount of cash dividends the bank can declare and pay without prior regulatory approval 
presently  the bank cannot declare or pay dividends in any one year in excess of retained earnings for that year subject to risk based capital requirements 
anti takeover provisions may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders 
we are a pennsylvania corporation 
anti takeover provisions in pennsylvania law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
these provisions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could reduce the amount that shareholders might receive if we are sold 
for example  our articles of incorporation provide that our board of directors may issue up to  shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval  subject to the rights of the outstanding shares of preferred stock 
in addition  anti takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation and federal and state laws  including pennsylvania law  may restrict a third party s ability to obtain control of the company and may prevent shareholders from receiving a premiu m for their shares of our common stock 
our executive officers  directors and other five percent or greater shareholders own a significant percentage of our company  and could influence matters requiring approval by our shareholders 
as of december   our executive officers and directors as a group owned and had the right to vote approximately of our outstanding stock and other five percent or greater shareholders owned and had the right to vote approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these shareholders  acting together  would be able to influence matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of metro
