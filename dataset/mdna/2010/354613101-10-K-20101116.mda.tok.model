during the fiscal year ended september  fiscal year  market returns improved as the global economy emerged from recession and moved towards recovery 
while global markets showed signs of stabilization  volatility remained throughout the year  most notably during our third fiscal quarter as the sovereign debt crisis in europe led to more turbulent conditions 
the overall improvement was evidenced by increases in the msci all country world and s p indexes of and during the fiscal year 
the recovery in the markets significantly benefited our assets under management  fee revenues and non operating income  all of which increased considerably during fiscal year our total assets under management at september  were billion  higher than at september  the growth resulted from net new flows of billion and market appreciation of billion 
our simple monthly average assets under management for fiscal year increased by over the prior year 
although the financial markets improved during the fiscal year  the business and regulatory environments in which we operate remain uncertain and subject to change 
on july   president 
table of contents obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the reform act  which is expected to impose additional restrictions and limitations on our business 
we will continue to review and evaluate the reform act and the extent of its impact on our business as the various rules and regulations required for implementation are adopted 
the impact of the reform act on our financial position and results of operations  if any  is not known at this time 
uncertainties regarding the economic recovery remain in the foreseeable future

our assets under management at september  were higher than they were at september   driven by positive net new flows of billion and market appreciation of billion during the fiscal year 
the net new flows were primarily due to significantly higher sales of fixed income products  while the market appreciation related to both equity and fixed income products as improved market conditions led to significant valuation increases 
during fiscal year  assets under management increased  primarily resulting from market appreciation of billion  which occurred predominantly in fixed income products  partially offset by net new outflows of billion

our effective investment management fee rate investment management fees divided by simple monthly average assets under management was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year and for the fiscal year ended september  fiscal year 
the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to higher levels of global international assets under management 
the decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to a shift in the mix of assets under management from equity products toward fixed income products 
generally  investment management fees on international products are higher than fees earned on united states products as they include fees to offset higher distribution costs  and fees earned on equity products are higher than fees earned on fixed income products

table of contents investment management fees increased in fiscal year resulting from a increase in simple monthly average assets under management and a higher effective investment management fee rate 
investment management fees decreased in fiscal year resulting from a decrease in simple monthly average assets under management and a lower effective investment management fee rate 
underwriting and distribution fees we earn underwriting fees from the sale of certain classes of sponsored investment products on which investors pay a sales commission at the time of purchase 
sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some share classes and for some sale transactions depending upon the amount invested and the type of investor 
therefore  underwriting fees will change with the overall level of gross sales  the size of individual transactions  and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors 
globally  our mutual funds and certain other products generally pay us distribution fees in return for sales  marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf 
specifically  the majority of us registered mutual funds  with the exception of certain of our money market mutual funds  have adopted distribution plans under rule b the rule b plans promulgated under the investment company act of the investment company act 
the rule b plans permit the mutual funds to bear certain expenses relating to the distribution of their shares  such as expenses for marketing  advertising  printing and sales promotion  subject to the rule b plans limitations on amounts 
the individual rule b plans set a percentage limit for rule b expenses based on average daily net assets under management of the mutual fund 
similar arrangements exist for the distribution of our non us registered funds and where  generally  the distributor of the funds in the local market arranges for and pays commissions 
we pay a significant portion of underwriting and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf 
see the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below 
overall  underwriting and distribution fees increased in fiscal year underwriting fees increased primarily due to an increase in commissionable sales 
distribution fees increased primarily due to a increase in simple monthly average assets under management 
total underwriting and distribution fees decreased in fiscal year underwriting fees decreased primarily due to a shift in sales from equity products to fixed income products  which typically generate lower underwriting fees  combined with a decrease in gross commissionable sales 
distribution fees decreased primarily due to a decrease in simple monthly average assets under management and a higher mix of fixed income assets 
distribution fees are generally higher for equity products  as compared to fixed income products 
shareholder servicing fees we receive shareholder servicing fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services  which include providing customer statements  transaction processing  customer service  and tax reporting 
these fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered 
in some instances  we charge sponsored investment products these fees based on the level of assets under management 
in the united states  transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year generally remain billable at a reduced rate through the second quarter of the following calendar year 
in canada  such agreements provide that accounts closed in the calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year 
accordingly  the level of fees will vary with the change in open accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable 
approximately million 
table of contents accounts closed in the us during calendar year were no longer billable effective july   as compared to approximately million accounts closed during calendar year that were no longer billable effective july  approximately thousand accounts closed in canada during calendar year were no longer billable effective may   as compared to approximately thousand accounts closed during calendar year that were no longer billable effective may  shareholder servicing fees increased in fiscal year primarily due to a increase in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts and a favorable currency impact 
the account increase was predominantly related to shareholder accounts originated in the united states 
the favorable currency impact mainly resulted from a increase in the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar 
shareholder servicing fees decreased in fiscal year primarily due to an unfavorable currency impact and a decrease in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts 
the unfavorable currency impact mainly resulted from a decrease in the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar 
the account decrease was predominantly related to shareholder accounts originated in canada and the united states 
other  net other  net revenue primarily consists of revenues from the banking finance segment as well as income from custody services 
banking finance revenues include interest income on loans  servicing income  and realized and unrealized gains losses on residual interests from securitization transactions  and are reduced by interest expense and the provision for loan losses 
we have consistently followed our methodology in determining our allowance for loan losses  which incorporates current economic factors 
other  net revenue also includes the net investment income of our consolidated sponsored investment products  which is primarily comprised of dividend and interest income 
other  net revenue increased in fiscal year primarily due to gains from increases in the fair value of retained interests from securitizations of million  compared to losses from decreases in fair value in the prior period of million 
the increase was partially offset by a million decrease in net investment income from our consolidated sponsored investment products 
other  net revenue decreased in fiscal year primarily due to a million higher loss from declines in the fair value of residual interests from securitization transactions and a million decrease in interest income from automobile loans  partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense on swap contracts and a million decrease in provision for loan losses

table of contents underwriting and distribution underwriting and distribution expenses include payments to financial advisers and other third parties for providing sales  marketing and distribution services to investors in our sponsored investment products 
underwriting and distribution expenses increased in fiscal year consistent with the increase in underwriting and distribution revenues during the year and an increase in distribution expenses relating to our international products 
the decrease in underwriting and distribution expenses in fiscal year was consistent with the decrease in underwriting and distribution revenues during the same period 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefit expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to increases in variable compensation and commissions  partially offset by a decrease related to severance costs incurred in the prior fiscal year 
variable compensation increased million  mainly due to higher bonus expense based on our performance 
commissions increased million  reflecting higher levels of sponsored investment product sales 
severance costs of million were recognized in fiscal year related to reductions to our global workforce of approximately 
higher salaries  wages and benefits during fiscal year resulting from annual merit salary adjustments  unfavorable currency impacts and higher benefit costs were largely offset by the impact of reduced staffing levels 
the level of our global workforce throughout most of the year was lower than in the prior fiscal year 
at september   our global workforce had increased to approximately  employees from approximately  at september  compensation and benefit expenses decreased in fiscal year primarily due to declines in salaries  wages and benefits and variable compensation 
salaries  wages and benefits decreased million  mainly resulting from lower staffing levels and a favorable currency impact 
the decrease was partially offset by severance costs of million 
variable compensation decreased million 
we continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy 
as such  any changes in the underlying performance of our sponsored investment products or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefits going forward 
however  in order to attract and retain talented individuals  our level of compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue 
information systems  technology and occupancy information systems  technology and occupancy costs increased in fiscal year primarily due to higher technology and occupancy costs related to our owned and leased offices and approximately million in non recurring occupancy costs related to a property sublease 
information systems  technology and occupancy costs decreased in fiscal year primarily due to lower costs incurred for external data services  technology consulting  technology supplies  and occupancy 
the lower costs resulted in part from our cost reduction efforts to defer non business critical initiatives and to reduce expenditures for contractors and professional fees 
details of capitalized information systems and technology costs  which exclude occupancy costs  are shown below

table of contents advertising and promotion advertising and promotion expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to a million increase in marketing support payments to intermediaries resulting from higher product sales and assets under management 
higher levels of advertising and sales promotion activities also contributed to the increase 
advertising and promotion expenses decreased in fiscal year primarily due to a million decrease in marketing support payments to intermediaries resulting from lower product sales and assets under management 
also contributing to the decrease were lower advertising  sales promotions and travel expenses primarily as a result of our global cost reduction initiatives 
we are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions  and to advance our products where we see continued or potential new growth opportunities 
as a result of potential changes in our strategic marketing campaigns  the level of advertising and promotion expenditures may increase more rapidly  or decrease more slowly  than our revenues 
amortization of deferred sales commissions certain fund share classes sold globally  including class c shares marketed in the united states and class b shares marketed outside of the united states  are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders  although our distribution subsidiaries pay an up front commission to financial intermediaries on these sales 
in addition  certain share classes  such as class a shares sold in the united states  are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders when minimum investment criteria are met  although our distribution subsidiaries pay an up front commission to financial intermediaries on these sales 
we defer all up front commissions paid by our distribution subsidiaries and amortize them over the periods in which commissions are generally recovered from distribution and service fee revenues and contingent deferred sales charges received from shareholders of the funds upon redemption of their shares 
we evaluate deferred commission assets dca for recoverability on a periodic basis using undiscounted expected cash flows from the shares of mutual funds sold without a front end sales charge 
amortization of deferred sales commissions increased in fiscal year mainly due to higher product sales with up front commissions  primarily related to us funds 
amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased in fiscal year mainly due to lower product sales with up front commissions  also primarily related to us funds 
other operating expenses other operating expenses primarily consist of fund administration services and shareholder servicing fees payable to external parties  professional fees  corporate travel and entertainment  and other miscellaneous expenses 
other operating expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to a million increase in fund administration services and shareholder servicing fees payable to external parties  which resulted from higher average assets under management  and a million increase in corporate travel expenses 
other operating expenses decreased in fiscal year primarily due to a million decline in fund administration services and shareholder servicing fees payable to external parties  which resulted from lower average assets under management  and a million decrease in corporate travel and entertainment expenses resulting from our cost reduction initiatives

other income expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to higher investment valuations 
the market recovery resulted in a million decrease in other than temporary impairments on available for sale investment securities  a million increase in net gains from trading investment securities and a million increase in net realized gains on sale of available for sale investment securities 
the increases were partially offset by decreases of million in net gains from securities held by our consolidated investment products  million in interest income  million in net foreign currency exchange gains losses  and million in capital gain distributions 
in addition  interest expense increased by million  primarily related to million of long term debt issued in may during fiscal year  we re evaluated our accounting for investments in mutual fund sponsored investment products  which resulted in the deconsolidation of certain funds 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded million of related net gains recognized in earnings in prior years as a reduction to other income expenses  primarily impacting consolidated sponsored investment products gains losses  net 
see note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
other income expenses decreased in fiscal year primarily due to lower investment valuations during the first half of the year 
the significant decline in interest rates and the global market downturn resulted in a million decrease in interest income  a million increase in other than temporary impairments on available for sale investment securities  a million decline in net realized gains on sale of available for sale investment securities  and a million decline in income from equity method investees 
these decreases were partially offset by an million increase in net gains from securities held by our consolidated sponsored investment products  resulting from improved market conditions during the second half of the fiscal year 
our investments in sponsored investment products primarily consist of the initial cash investments made in the course of launching mutual fund and other investment product offerings  however we may also invest in our products for other business reasons 
the market conditions that impact our assets under management similarly affect the investment income earned or losses incurred on our sponsored investment product investments 
taxes on income as a multi national corporation  we provide investment management and related services to a wide range of international sponsored investment products  often managed from locations outside the united states 
some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the united states 
the mix of pre tax income 
table of contents primarily from our investment management and related services business subject to these lower rates  when aggregated with income originating in the united states  produces a lower overall effective income tax rate than existing us federal and state income tax rates 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal year was  as compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in tax reserves as a result of new legislation  partially offset by a valuation allowance release for state net operating losses and a favorable international tax ruling 
the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to a shift in the mix of pre tax income from lower tax jurisdictions to higher tax jurisdictions 
the effective income tax rate for future reporting periods will continue to reflect the relative contributions of non us earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in us taxable income

table of contents we experienced an increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in net income  a lower increase in trading securities and an increase in operating liabilities 
investing cash outflows in fiscal year  as compared to investing cash inflows in the prior fiscal year  were mainly due to a decrease in liquidation of investments and an increase in loans receivable  partially offset by a decrease in purchase of investments 
net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to increased dividends paid on common stock and common stock repurchases  partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long term debt 
capital resources we believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets  continuing cash flows from operations  borrowing capacity under current credit facilities and the ability to issue debt or equity securities

table of contents interest rates  credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets 
if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner  our business could be adversely impacted

table of contents as of september   our consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million  and million of related accrued interest see note taxes on income in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest that are expected to be paid in the next twelve months are million and million 
however  because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  a reasonable estimate of the period of cash payments beyond the next twelve months from the balance sheet date of september  cannot be made 
consequently  unrecognized tax benefits have not been included in the table above 
contingent obligations we are obligated to cover shortfalls for automobile loan securitization trusts that are structured as qualified special entities in amounts due to holders of asset backed securities up to certain levels 
at september   the maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees was million and the fair value of the guarantees recognized as banking finance liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet was not significant

these standby letters of credit were fully collateralized by marketable securities at september  off balance sheet arrangements we previously held ownership interests in lightning finance company limited lfl and lightning asset finance limited lafl 
due to our significant interest in lafl  we carried on our consolidated balance sheets the dca generated in the united states and the financing liability for the related future revenue we previously sold to lfl  which was subsequently transferred to lafl 
we repurchased the remaining dca from lafl in september and reflected this transaction as a repayment of the remaining financing obligation

fair value measurements we use a three level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable 
the three levels of fair value hierarchy are set forth below 
our assessment of the hierarchy level of the assets or liabilities measured at fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
transfers between levels are recognized at the end of each quarter 
level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level quoted prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or corroborated by observable market data 
level quoted prices are obtained from independent third party brokers or dealers  including prices derived from model based valuation techniques for which the significant assumptions are observable in the market or corroborated by observable market data 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity 
these inputs require significant management judgment and reflect our estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
level valuations are derived primarily from model based valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the market 
we record substantially all of our investments in the consolidated financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
trading securities and securities available for sale are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
we may also measure certain assets or liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
these fair value measurements generally result from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting for loans held for sale or write downs of individual assets 
level assets represented approximately of total assets measured at fair value at september   and there were no level liabilities measured at fair value 
there were immaterial transfers into and out of level during fiscal year 
table of contents the following is a description of the significant assets measured at fair value  the fair value methodologies used  and the fair value hierarchy level 
investment securities  trading consist primarily of non consolidated sponsored investment products held for trading purposes  securities held by consolidated sponsored investment products and residual interests and retained subordinated securities from securitization transactions 
changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized as gains and losses in earnings 
the fair value of non consolidated sponsored investment products is determined based on the published net asset values of the sponsored investment products  and they are classified as level the fair value of securities held by consolidated sponsored investment products is determined using quoted market prices  or independent third party broker or dealer price quotes if quoted market prices are not available 
these securities are primarily classified as level or level if events occur after the close of the primary market for any security  the quoted market prices may be adjusted for the observable price movements within country specific market proxies 
consolidated sponsored investment products may also hold securities that are classified as level because their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs 
in these instances  we primarily employ a market based approach  which may use prices of recent transactions  various market multiples  book values and other relevant information for the investment or related or other comparable assets to determine the fair value of the investment 
in developing this fair value  we may also give consideration to an income based approach valuation  which considers anticipated future cash flows of the investment and converts those amounts into a net present value 
a discount may also be applied due to the nature or duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the asset 
the fair value of residual interests from securitization transactions is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses using unobservable inputs  and they are classified as level the residual interests consist of interest only strips receivable and cash on deposit  and are backed by prime  non prime and sub prime automobile loans issued from march to april the fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses 
key inputs to the analysis include the excess cash flow discount rate  cumulative life loss rate  expected weighted average life and prepayment speed assumptions 
we develop our key inputs using our actual portfolio experience and recent market activity for similar transactions 
the key assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of the residual interests to an immediate adverse change in those assumptions are shown in note securitization of loans held for sale in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
the fair value of retained subordinated securities is determined using independent third party broker or dealer price quotes  and these securities are classified as level the broker or dealer price quotes are evaluated for reasonableness based upon the performance of the underlying loans and comparable transaction pricing in the securitization market 
investment securities  available for sale consist primarily of non consolidated sponsored investment products and debt securities including securities of us states and political subdivisions  securities of the us treasury and federal agencies  corporate debt securities  mortgage backed securities agency residential  and other equity securities 
realized gains and losses are included in investment income using either the average cost method or specific identification method 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded net of tax as part of accumulated other comprehensive income until realized 
the fair value of non consolidated sponsored investment products is determined based on the published net asset values of the sponsored investment products and they are classified as level the fair value of debt securities is determined using quoted market prices  if available  or independent third party broker or dealer price quotes  which are evaluated for reasonableness  and they are generally classified as level  except for certain us treasury securities which are classified as level the fair value of other equity securities  which consist primarily of non sponsored investment products  is generally determined based on the published net asset values of the investment products and 
table of contents they are classified as level we may also hold other equity securities that are classified as level because their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs 
in these instances we primarily employ the market based approach described above for level securities held by consolidated sponsored investment products 
while we believe the valuation methodologies described above are appropriate  the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 
investments are evaluated for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis when the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value 
for available for sale equity securities  we consider many factors  including the severity and duration of the decline in the fair value below cost  our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value  and the financial condition and specific events related to the issuer 
when an impairment of an available for sale equity security is determined to be other than temporary  we recognize the impairment in earnings 
for available for sale debt securities  if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost  we record the entire impairment in earnings 
if we do not intend to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of its amortized cost  we separate the impairment into the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss and the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors 
the credit loss component is the difference between the security s amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows 
the credit loss component is recognized in earnings and the losses related to all other factors are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
while we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary impairment in our portfolio  different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
intangible assets consist primarily of mutual fund management contracts and customer base assets resulting from business acquisitions 
we amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives  which range from seven to years  using the straight line method  unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life 
indefinite lived intangible assets primarily represent contracts to manage mutual fund assets for which there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period 
we make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity  as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
our goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step requires the identification of the reporting units  and comparison of the fair value of each of these reporting units to the respective carrying value 
if the carrying value is less than the fair value  no impairment exists and the second step is not performed 
if the carrying value is higher than the fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
we have two reporting units  investment management and related services and banking finance  which are the same as our operating segments 
all goodwill has been assigned to the investment management and related services reporting unit 

table of contents indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired 
impairment is indicated when the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible assets  we use valuation techniques based on an income approach under which future cash flows are discounted 
our future cash flow estimates include assumptions about revenue and assets under management growth rates  the pre tax profit margin  the average effective fee rate  the effective tax rate  and the discount rate  which is based on our weighted average cost of capital 
the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of estimated fair value are the assets under management growth rate and the discount rate 
we performed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of august  we estimated the discounted future cash flows using a compounded annual growth rate of assets under management and a discount rate of 
the fair value of the investment management and related services reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 
the fair values of our indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 
the assumptions used in our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets were developed taking into account the ongoing volatility in the capital and credit markets 
as a result  the growth rate assumption used as of august  was lower than the historical compounded growth rates 
we did not recognize any impairment because our estimates of the fair values of our reporting unit and our indefinite lived assets exceeded their respective carrying values 
a hypothetical basis point decline in the assets under management growth rate or a basis point increase in the discount rate would not cause either the investment management and related services reporting unit or the management contracts to fail the first step of the impairment tests for goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets 
we subsequently monitor the market conditions and their potential impact on the assumptions used in the annual calculations of fair value to determine whether circumstances have changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying value  or indicate that our indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired 
we consider  among other things  changes in our assets under management and pre tax profit margin amounts  which affect our revenue growth rate assumptions  by assessing whether these changes would impact the reasonableness of the assumptions used in our impairment test as of august  we also monitor fluctuations of our common stock per share price to evaluate our market capitalization relative to the reporting unit as a whole 
subsequent to august   there were no impairments to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets as we determined no events occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value  or indicate that our indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired 
we test definite lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly 
impairment is indicated when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
in evaluating the recoverability of definite lived intangible assets  we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from these assets 
our future undiscounted cash flow projections include assumptions about revenue and assets under management growth rates  effective fee rates  investor redemptions  the pre tax profit margin  and expected useful lives 
the most relevant of these assumptions to determine future cash flows is the change in the amount of assets under management 
the assumptions used in our impairment tests are developed taking into consideration the ongoing market conditions 
if the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows  we measure the impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value of the asset is determined by discounted cash flows or other methods as appropriate for the asset type 

table of contents as of september   approximately of our definite lived intangible assets related to investment management contracts of fiduciary trust company international ftci 
the undiscounted future cash flow projections for ftci institutional and high net worth management contracts exceeded their carrying values by approximately and  respectively 
the undiscounted future cash flow projections for the other definite lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 
we estimated the future undiscounted cash flows for all definite lived intangible assets using assets under management growth rates ranging from to depending on the type of management contracts 
the assumptions used in our impairment tests for definite lived intangible assets were developed taking into consideration ongoing market conditions 
as of september   a decline in the assets under management of approximately basis points could cause us to evaluate whether the fair value of our definite lived intangible assets is below the asset carrying value 
while we believe that our impairment tests and the assumptions used to estimate fair value are reasonable and appropriate  if the assumptions used in our estimates of fair value change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise accelerate amortization expense 
revenues we recognize investment management fees  shareholder servicing fees and distribution fees as earned over the period in which services are rendered  except for performance based investment management fees  which are recognized when earned 
we recognize underwriting commissions related to the sale of shares of our sponsored investment products on the trade date 
investment management fees are generally determined based on a percentage of assets under management  except for performance based investment management fees  which are based on performance targets established in the related investment management contracts 
generally  shareholder servicing fees are calculated based on the number and type of accounts serviced  while distribution fees are generally based on a percentage of assets under management 
assets under management is calculated for our sponsored investment products using fair value methods derived primarily from unadjusted quoted market prices  unadjusted independent third party broker or dealer price quotes in active markets  or adjusted market prices or price quotes 
the fair values of securities for which market prices are not readily available are internally valued using various methodologies as appropriate for each security type 
securities for which market prices are not readily available generally represent a de minimus amount of our total assets under management 
the pricing of the securities held by our sponsored investment products is governed by a global valuation and pricing policy  which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type  including practices for responding to unexpected or unusual market events 
while recent economic conditions have increased market price volatility  the fair value of the majority of the securities held by the sponsored investment products continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
for each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition 
table of contents threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
we recognize the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties in other operating expenses 
as a multinational corporation  we operate in various locations outside the united states and generate earnings from our non us subsidiaries 
we indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries  except for income previously taxed in the us  subject to regulatory or contractual repatriation restrictions or contractual repatriation requirements  and the excess net earnings after debt service payments and regulatory capital requirements of our canadian and uk consolidated subsidiaries 
as a result  we have not recognized a provision for us income taxes and a deferred income tax liability on billion of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings that are indefinitely reinvested at september  changes to our policy of reinvestment or repatriation of non us earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business 
when such a matter arises and periodically thereafter  we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time 
in management s opinion  an adequate accrual has been made as of september  to provide for probable losses that may arise from these matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount 
see also note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
consolidation of variable interest entities we consolidate variable interest entities vies for which we are considered the primary beneficiary 
a vie is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment 
the entity that has the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership  referred to as the primary beneficiary  is required to consolidate the vie 
we invest in various entities in the normal course of business and evaluate whether each entity is a vie 
for the entities determined to be vies  we assess whether we qualify as the primary beneficiary of the vies 
our vies primarily include certain sponsored investment products and certain other investment products in which we hold an equity ownership interest 
other vies include limited liability partnerships  limited liability companies  and joint ventures 
the form of variable interests that we have in vies generally includes our equity ownership interest and investment management and related service fees earned from sponsored investment products 
our evaluation of whether we qualify as the primary beneficiary of vies is highly complex and involves significant judgments  estimates and assumptions 
we generally utilize expected cash flow scenarios to determine our interest in the expected losses or residual returns of vies from our investment management and related service fees or equity ownership interests held 
the key estimates and assumptions used in our analyses include the amount of assets under management  investment management and related service fee rates  the life of the investment product  and the discount rate 
these estimates and assumptions are subject to variability 
for example  assets under management are impacted by market volatility and the level of sales  redemptions  contributions  withdrawals and dividend reinvestments of mutual fund shares that occur daily 
also  investment management fees may be fixed or tiered based on the amount of assets under management  the life of a sponsored investment product may be finite or indefinite  and the discount rate could be affected by credit  liquidity or other risks factors 
in addition  third party purchases and redemptions  which are outside of our control  need to be evaluated to determine whether they cause a reconsideration event 

table of contents based on our evaluation  we believe we were not the primary beneficiary of vies and  as a result  did not consolidate these entities as of and for fiscal year while we believe that our evaluation was appropriate  future changes in estimates  judgments  and assumptions may affect whether certain entities require consolidation in our financial statements 
effective october   we will adopt a new fasb standard that will impact our determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary of certain vies 
as a result  we will consolidate certain vies that are not currently consolidated

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is subject to market risk  including  but not limited to  potential loss due to changes in the value of financial instruments including those resulting from adverse changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and market valuation 
financial instruments include  but are not limited to  investment securities  loans  deposits and debt obligations 
management is responsible for managing market risk 
our enterprise risk management committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify  assess and manage market and other risks 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily through our loans  investment in debt securities  deposit liabilities and other outstanding debt 
we minimize the impact of changes in interest rates related to our investments in debt securities by managing the maturities of these securities  and through diversification 
we minimize the impact of changes in interest rates related to our outstanding debt by entering into financing transactions that ensure an appropriate mix of debt at fixed and variable interest rates 
in addition  our banking finance segment monitors the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets  as well as funding sources and  from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate interest rate exposure arising from the loans receivable portfolio 
at september   we have considered the potential impact of a movement in market interest rates on interest earning assets  net of interest bearing liabilities of our banking finance segment  total debt outstanding and our portfolio of debt securities 
based on our analysis  we do not expect that this change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations in the next twelve months  for each of these categories or in the aggregate 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk through our international operations 
while we operate primarily in the united states  we also provide services and earn revenues in the bahamas  asia pacific  canada  europe  latin america and africa 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is minimized in relation to our results of operations since a significant portion of these revenues are denominated in us dollars 
this situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the united states and expenses incurred denominated in foreign currencies increase 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk in relation to our consolidated balance sheet mostly relates to cash and cash equivalents and investments that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily in euro  pound sterling  indian rupee  and canadian dollar 
these assets accounted for approximately of the total cash and cash equivalents and investments at september  we also have exposure to foreign exchange revaluation of us dollar balances held by certain us subsidiaries for which their local currency is the functional currency 
these assets accounted for approximately of the total cash and cash equivalents and investments at september  we generally do not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risk exposure 
as a result  both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar may affect our results of operations and accumulated other comprehensive income 
we are exposed to market valuation risks related to securities we hold that are carried at fair value and securities held by sponsored investment products that we consolidate  which are also carried at fair value
