the manufactured housing segment has been affected by a continuing decline in industry sales 
this decline  caused primarily by the adverse economic conditions  tightening retail and wholesale credit markets and a depressed site built housing market  is resulting in historically low industry shipments 
the industry  however  has recently experienced an increase in shipments 
from january to may  total shipments were approximately  units  a percent increase from the same period a year ago 
tight credit markets for retail and wholesale financing have become a significant challenge for the manufactured housing industry 
according to the manufactured housing institute  a lack of retail financing options and restrictive credit standards has negatively affected manufactured home buyers

the corporation s recreational vehicle segment sells travel trailers  fifth wheels and park models 
sales of recreational vehicles are influenced by changes in consumer confidence  the availability of retail and wholesale financing and gasoline prices 
from calendar to industry sales of travel trailers and fifth wheels decreased
