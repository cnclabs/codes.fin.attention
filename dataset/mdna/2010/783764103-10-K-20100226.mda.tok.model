results of operations overview operating conditions in the homebuilding industry remained difficult in  extending the downturn which began in since the latter half of  the lack of availability of mortgage products resulting from an industrywide increase in loan delinquency and foreclosure rates  as well as the related tightening of credit standards  has impacted the housing industry and the company s ability to attract qualified homebuyers 
these factors have not only exacerbated already high inventory levels of new and resale homes  but also weakened consumer confidence 
demand pressure from foreclosures and unsettled credit markets continued through  while rising unemployment slowed the decline in existing and new housing inventories 
sales rates remained weak during  and the company continued to report declines in the volume of homes sold  as well as in prices 
as a result  additional valuation adjustments were recorded 
the company has continued its operating strategy of focusing on cash generation  opportunistic land sales  monetization of its deferred tax assets  reductions in excess inventory and existing commitments to purchase land through contract renegotiations and cancellations  controlled development spending  renegotiations of contracts with subcontractors and suppliers  reductions in overhead expense to more closely match projected volume levels  and repayment  replacement or repurchase of near term debt to extend maturities 
as a consequence of the company s cash preservation efforts  a slow decrease in land prices relative to home price declines and an emphasis on closing communities having a low number of remaining homes to sell  the company operated from percent fewer active communities at december   versus december   and its inventory of lots controlled as of december   was down percent from a year ago 
because the supply of well priced land available for development remains somewhat constrained  replacing communities in selective markets is rapidly becoming one of the company s greatest challenges  as well as one of its highest priorities  as it looks for opportunities to return to growth and profitability

the company believes that access to traditional capital will be constrained in 
table of contents the early stages of a recovery and that lenders will migrate to the homebuilders with the strongest balance sheets 
the company believes that its cash balances  low net debt to capital ratio  lean operating structure and access to liquidity will allow it to take advantage of opportunities that may arise  thereby facilitating accelerated growth and market share as conditions improve 
because conditions remained difficult in  evaluation of the company s assets through quarterly impairment analyses resulted in million of inventory and other valuation adjustments during the course of the year 
a charge of million related to the abandonment of land purchase option contracts reflects the deterioration of specific related returns and or unsuccessful renegotiations of land acquisition contract terms 
in addition  the company recorded a net valuation allowance of million against its deferred tax assets 
these assets were largely the result of inventory impairments taken  and the allowance against them reflects uncertainty with regard to the duration of current conditions in the housing market

critical accounting policies preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the use of judgment in the application of accounting policies and estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
listed below are those policies that management believes are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
management has discussed the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of its board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure 
there are items within the financial statements that require estimation  but they are not considered critical 
use of estimates in budgeting land acquisitions  development and homebuilding construction costs associated with real estate projects  the company evaluates market conditions  material and labor costs  buyer preferences  construction timing  and provisions for insurance and warranty obligations 
the company accrues its best estimate of probable cost for resolution of legal claims 
estimates  which are based on historical experience and other assumptions  are reviewed continually  updated when necessary and believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes that the timing and scope of its evaluation procedures are proper and adequate 
changes in assumptions relating to such factors  however  could have a material effect on the company s results of operations for a particular quarterly or annual period 
income recognition as required by asc no 
asc  real estate retail land formerly sfas  accounting for sales of real estate  revenues and cost of sales are recorded at the time each home or lot is closed  title and possession are transferred to the buyer  and there is no significant continuing involvement from the homebuilder 
in order to match revenues with related expenses  land  land development  interest  taxes and other related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future are allocated to the cost of homes closed  based upon the relative sales value basis of the total number of homes to be constructed in each community  in accordance with asc no 
asc  real estate general formerly sfas  accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects 
estimated land  common area development and related costs of planned communities  including the cost of amenities  are allocated to individual parcels or communities on a relative sales value basis 
changes to estimated costs  subsequent to the commencement of the delivery of homes  are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community 
home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method 
inventory valuation housing inventories consist principally of homes under construction  land under development and improved lots  and inventory held for sale 
inventory includes land and development costs  direct construction costs  capitalized indirect construction costs  capitalized interest  and real estate taxes 
the costs of acquiring and developing land and constructing certain related amenities are allocated to the parcels to which these costs relate 
interest and taxes are capitalized during active development and construction 
inventories to be held and used are stated at cost unless a community is determined to be impaired  in which case the impaired inventories are written down to fair value 
inventories held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell 
in accordance with asc  inventory is reviewed for potential write downs on an ongoing basis 
asc requires that  in the event that impairment indicators are present and undiscounted cash flows signify that the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable  impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 
the company reviews all communities on a quarterly basis for changes in events or circumstances indicating signs of impairment 
examples of events or changes in circumstances include  but are not limited to price declines resulting from sustained competitive pressures  a change in the manner in which the asset is being used  a change in assessments by a regulator or municipality  cost increases  the expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life  and the impact of local economic or macroeconomic conditions  such as employment or housing supply  on the market for a given product 
signs of impairment may include  but are not limited to very low or negative profit margins  the absence of sales activity in an open community  and or significant price differences for comparable parcels of land held for sale 
if it is determined that indicators of impairment exist in a community  undiscounted cash flows are prepared and analyzed at a community level based on expected pricing  sales rates  construction costs  local municipality fees  and warranty  closing  carrying  selling  overhead and other related costs or similar assets to determine if the realizable value of the assets held are less than their respective carrying amounts 
in order to determine assumed sales prices included in cash flow models  the company analyzes historical sales prices on homes delivered in the community and other communities in the geographic area  as well as sales prices included in its current backlog for such communities 
in addition  it analyzes market studies and trends  which generally include statistics on sales prices in neighboring communities and sales prices of similar products in non neighboring communities in the same geographic area 
in order to estimate costs to build and deliver homes  the company generally assumes a cost structure reflecting contracts currently in place with vendors  adjusted for any anticipated cost reduction initiatives or increases 
the company s analysis of each community generally assumes current pricing equal to current sales orders for a particular or comparable community 
for a minority of communities that the company does not intend to operate for an extended period or whose operating life extends beyond several years  slight increases over current sales prices are assumed in later years 
once impaired  the company s determination of fair value and new cost basis is primarily based on discounting estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with inherent risks that are associated with assets 
discount rates used generally vary from percent to percent  depending on market risk  the size or life of a community and development risk 
due to the fact that estimates and assumptions included in cash flow models are based on historical results and projected trends  unexpected changes in market conditions that may lead to additional impairment charges in the future cannot be anticipated 
valuation adjustments are recorded against homes completed or under construction  land under development and improved lots when analyses indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values 
write downs of impaired inventories to fair value are recorded as adjustments to the cost basis of the respective inventory 
at december  and  valuation reserves related to impaired inventories amounted to million and million  respectively 
the net carrying values of the related inventories amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
inventory costs include direct costs of land and land development  material acquisition  and home construction expenses 
the costs of acquiring and developing land and constructing certain related amenities are allocated to the parcels to which these costs relate 
management believes its processes are designed to properly assess the market and carrying values of assets 
warranty reserves the company s homes are sold with limited third party warranties 
warranty reserves are established as homes close on a house by house basis in an amount estimated to be adequate to cover expected costs of materials and outside labor during warranty periods 
certain factors are considered in determining the reserves  including the historical range of amounts paid per house  experience with respect to similar home designs and geographical areas  the historical amount paid as a percentage of home construction costs  any warranty expenditures not considered to be normal and recurring  and conditions that may affect certain subdivisions 
improvements in quality control and construction techniques expected to impact future warranty expenditures are also considered 
accordingly  the process of determining the company s warranty reserves balance necessarily requires estimates associated with various assumptions  each of which can positively or negatively impact this balance 
generally  warranty reserves are reviewed monthly to determine the reasonableness and adequacy of both the aggregate reserve amount and the per unit reserve amount originally included in home cost of sales  as well as to determine the timing of any reversals of the original reserves 
general warranty reserves not utilized for a particular house are evaluated for reasonableness in the aggregate on both a market by market basis and a consolidated basis 
warranty payments for an individual house may exceed the related reserve 
payments in excess of the related reserve are evaluated in the aggregate to determine if an adjustment to the warranty reserves should be recorded  which could result in a corresponding adjustment to home cost of sales 
the company continues to evaluate the adequacy of its warranty reserves and believes that its existing estimation process is materially accurate 
because the company s warranty reserves can be impacted by a significant number of factors  it is possible that changes to the company s assumptions could have a material impact on its warranty reserve balances 
income taxes the company calculates a provision for its income taxes by using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the company evaluates its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is required 
in accordance with asc no 
asc  income taxes formerly sfas  accounting for income taxes  the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established based on its determination of whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  a valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law 
this assessment considers  among other matters  current and cumulative income and loss  future profitability  the duration of statutory carryback or carryforward periods  asset turns  and tax planning alternatives 
the company bases its estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates  and in certain cases  on business plan forecasts and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect the company s actual tax results  and its future business results may affect the amount of the company s deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of its deferred tax assets over time 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  particularly with respect to changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods  as well as to the fact that the residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions  it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in the company s historical analyses 
these differences could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the company recorded significant deferred tax assets in  and these deferred tax assets were generated primarily by inventory impairments 
the company believes that the continued downturn in the housing market  the uncertainty as to its length and magnitude  and the continued recognition of impairment charges are significant evidence of the need for a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets 
at december   the company recorded valuation allowances against all of its net deferred tax assets 
the company is allowed to carry forward tax losses for years and to apply such tax losses to future taxable income in order to realize federal deferred tax assets 
in addition  the company will be able to reverse previously recognized valuation allowances beginning in periods in which it reports book income before taxes 
variable interest entities vie asc requires a vie to be consolidated by a company if that company has the power to direct the vie s activities  the obligation to absorb its losses or the right to receive its benefits  which are potentially significant to the vie 
asc also requires disclosure about vies that the company is not obligated to consolidate  but in which it has a significant  though not primary  variable interest 
the company enters into joint ventures  from time to time  for the purpose of acquisition and co development of land parcels and lots 
its investment in these joint ventures may create a variable interest in a vie  depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement 
additionally  in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land for the construction of homes 
under such lot option purchase contracts  the company funds stated deposits in consideration for the right to purchase lots at a future point in time  usually at predetermined prices 
in accordance with the requirements of asc  certain of the company s lot option purchase contracts may result in the creation of a variable interest in a vie 
the company believes the accounting for joint ventures and land option purchase contracts using the variable interest consolidation methodology is a critical accounting policy because compliance with asc requires the use of complex judgment in its application 
mortgage loan loss reserves reserves are created to address repurchase and indemnity claims made by third party investors or purchasers that arise primarily if the borrower obtained the loan through fraudulent information or omissions and the borrower has made an insufficient number of payments  if there are origination deficiencies attributable to rmc  or if the borrower does not make a first payment 
reserves are determined based on pending claims received that are associated with previously sold mortgage loans  the company s portfolio delinquency and foreclosure rates on sold loans made available by investors  as well as on historical loss payment patterns used to develop ultimate loss projections 
estimating loss is difficult due to the inherent uncertainty in predicting foreclosure activity  as well as to delays in processing and requests for payment related to the loan loss by agencies and financial institutions 
recorded reserves represent the company s best estimate of current and future unpaid losses as of december   based on existing conditions and available information 
the company continues to evaluate the adequacy of its mortgage loan loss reserves and believes that its existing estimation process is materially accurate 
because the company s mortgage loan loss reserves can be impacted by a significant number of factors  it is possible that subsequent changes in conditions or available information may change assumptions and estimates  which could have a material impact on its mortgage loan loss reserve balances 
share based payments effective january   the company follows the provisions as required by asc no 
asc  compensation stock compensation formerly sfas r  share based payment  which requires that compensation expense be measured and recognized at an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted under compensation arrangements 
the company calculates the fair value of stock options by using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions and involves a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior 
additionally  judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to forfeit 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and the company s consolidated results of operations could be materially impacted 
the company believes that accounting for stock based compensation is a critical accounting policy because it requires the use of complex judgment in its application 
outlook during  the company experienced a decline in sales orders for new homes  compared to this decrease was due to broader market trends and economic conditions that contributed to soft demand for residential housing  as well as to a lower number of active communities 
nearly all markets have been affected by rising unemployment  lower consumer sentiment and declining home prices 
at december   the company s backlog of orders for new homes totaled  units  or a projected dollar value of million  reflecting an increase of percent in dollar value from million at december  recent activity by the federal government designed to stimulate the economy  combined with greater affordability resulting from lower home prices and interest rates  has improved demand during  versus  as measured by sales per active community 
recent trends in cancellation rates and sales discounts are encouraging  but the company is unable to predict the timing or the impact of the decline in stimulus programs  or whether recent trends are sustainable 
by implementing initiatives to lower construction costs and maintain current overhead levels  the company will balance cash preservation with the objective of returning to profitability 
in addition  it will seek to replace communities that have been closed with new land parcels designed to replenish its pipeline of lots and to generate higher target margins 
as long as the imbalance of housing supply and demand continues  the company will remain focused on its liquidity and balance sheet while also seeking to optimize its operating performance  thereby positioning itself for the return to a more favorable economic environment
