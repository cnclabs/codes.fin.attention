item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help readers of our financial statements understand our business  results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  the other sections of this annual report 
we conduct our operations in two segments our more dominant exploration and production segment  and our significantly smaller gathering and processing segment 
except as otherwise specifically noted  or as the context requires otherwise  and except to the extent that differences between these segments or our geographic segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole  we present this md a on a consolidated basis 
our md a includes the following sections overview a general description of our business  the value drivers of our business  measurements  and opportunities  challenges and risks 
financial risk management information about debt financing and financial risk management 
highlights a summary of significant activities and events affecting quicksilver 
results of operations an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements 
liquidity  capital resources and financial position an analysis of our cash flows  sources and uses of cash  contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
critical accounting estimates a discussion of critical accounting estimates that represent choices between acceptable alternatives and or require management judgments and assumptions 
overview we are a fort worth  texas based independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  exploitation  development and production of natural gas  ngls  and oil 
we focus primarily on unconventional reservoirs where hydrocarbons may be found in challenging geological conditions such as fractured shales  coal beds and tight sands 
we generate revenue  income and cash flows by producing and selling natural gas  ngls and oil 
we conduct acquisition  exploration  exploitation  development and production activities to replace the reserves that we produce 
at december  approximately of our proved reserves were natural gas and ngls 
consistent with one of our business strategies  we continue to develop and apply our unconventional resources expertise to our development projects in alberta  canada and in the barnett shale in texas 
our texas and alberta reserves made up and  respectively  of our proved reserves at december  our acreage in the horn river basin in british columbia will provide additional opportunity for further application of this expertise 
for  we plan to continue our focus on the development and exploitation of our properties in texas and alberta and to fund exploration in the horn river basin and green river basin 
we have allocated million of our consolidated capital program of million for drilling and completion activities 
of the remaining consolidated capital program  million has been allocated for gathering and processing activities including approximately million to be funded by kgs  million related to acquisition of additional leasehold interests and million for other property and equipment 
approximately million is allocated to projects in texas and approximately million is allocated to our canadian projects including million in alberta 
the remaining million of the capital program has been allocated to other areas in the us our exploratory activities in the horn river and green river basins are expected to consume million of our capital program 
we focus on three key value drivers reserve growth  production growth  and maximizing our operating cash flows 

table of contents our reserve growth relies on our ability to apply our technical and operational expertise in our core operating areas to develop  exploit and explore unconventional natural gas reservoirs 
we strive to increase reserves and production through aggressive management of operations and through relatively low risk development and exploitation drilling 
we will also continue to identify high potential exploratory projects with comparatively higher levels of financial risk 
all of our development and exploratory programs are aimed at providing us with opportunities to develop and exploit unconventional natural gas reservoirs which align to our technical and operational expertise 
our core operating areas and the acreage that we hold are well suited for production increases through development and exploitation drilling 
we perform workover and infrastructure projects to reduce ongoing operating costs and increase current and future production rates 
we regularly review the properties we operate to determine if steps can be taken to efficiently increase reserves and production 
in evaluating the result of our efforts  we consider the capital efficiency of our drilling program and also measure the following key indicators organic reserve growth  production volumes  cash flow from operating activities  and earnings per share 
years ended december  organic reserve growth production volumes bcfe cash flow from operating activities in millions diluted earnings loss per share this ratio is calculated by subtracting adjusted beginning of the year proved reserves from adjusted end of the year proved reserves and dividing by adjusted beginning of the year proved reserves 
adjusted beginning of the year reserves are calculated by deducting divested reserves and adjusted current year production from beginning of the year reserves 
adjusted current year production excludes production from purchased reserves 
adjusted end of the year reserves are calculated by deducting purchased reserves from end of the year reserves 
diluted earnings for include pre tax charges of million and million for impairments associated with our us and canadian oil and gas properties  respectively 
net loss also includes million of pre tax income attributable to our proportionate ownership of bbep and a pre tax charge of million for impairment of that investment 
diluted earnings for include a pre tax charge of million for impairment associated with our us oil and gas properties 
net loss also includes million of pre tax income attributable to our proportionate ownership of bbep and a pre tax charge of million for impairment of that investment 
diluted earnings for include a pre tax gain of million recognized from the divestiture of our northeast operations and a pre tax charge of million associated with the michigan sales contract 
financial risk management we have established internal control policies and procedures for managing risk within our organization 
the possibility of decreasing prices received for our natural gas  ngl and oil production is among the several risks that we face 
we seek to manage this risk by entering into derivative contracts which we strive to treat as financial hedges 
we have mitigated the downside risk of adverse price movements through the use of derivatives but  in doing so  have also limited our ability to benefit from favorable price movements 
this commodity price strategy enhances our ability to execute our development  exploitation and exploration programs  meet debt service requirements and pursue acquisition opportunities even in periods of price volatility or depression 
item a of this annual report contains details of our commodity price and interest rate risk management 

table of contents highlights eni transaction on june   we completed the eni transaction whereby we entered into a strategic alliance with eni and sold a interest in our alliance leasehold 
the total proceeds for the eni transaction were million in cash  inclusive of the gas purchase commitment  subject to normal post closing adjustments 
we used the proceeds from the transaction to repay a portion of the senior secured second lien facility 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
long term debt upon completion of the eni transaction  the borrowing base under the senior secured credit facility was adjusted to billion 
subsequently  a redetermination in october resulted in a revised borrowing base of billion 
the senior secured credit facility provides us an option to increase the commitments by up to million  with a maximum of billion with lender consent and additional commitments 
we can also extend the facility  which matures on february   up to two additional years with lenders approval and commitments 
on june   we issued senior notes due with a principal amount of million for proceeds of million 
the notes bear interest at the rate of 
the proceeds of these notes  in addition to proceeds from the eni transaction  were used to repay and terminate the remaining indebtedness under our senior secured second lien facility and to make repayments under the senior secured credit facility 
on august   we issued senior notes due with a principal amount of million for proceeds of million 
the notes bear interest at the rate of 
the proceeds of these notes were used to make repayments under the senior secured credit facility 
additional information about our long term debt is found in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
kgs secondary offering kgs issued  common units on december  in the kgs secondary offering and received million  net of underwriters discount and other offering costs 
on january   the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional  common units for million  which further reduced our ownership of kgs to effective january  the proceeds were used by kgs to repay borrowings of million outstanding under the kgs credit agreement in january kgs also re borrowed million in january under the kgs credit agreement to fund kgs purchase of the alliance midstream assets 
upon completion of the alliance midstream asset sale to kgs in january  we repaid million of borrowings under the senior secured credit facility 
increase in production daily production increased during from the production increase is discussed further in results of operations below 
horn river basin discovery during  we spent million for exploration and infrastructure development in the horn river basin where we have drilled and cased two wells  one of which was placed into service in the third quarter with the second well placed into service in the fourth quarter 
our capital expenditures include costs related to infrastructure development  such as construction of roads and production laterals 
we also entered into a nine year agreement with a third party that began in may for the firm processing and transportation of natural gas out of the horn river basin with initial volumes of mmcfd and increasing to mmcfd by may 
table of contents litigation update in october  a jury awarded million to the plaintiffs in our litigation originally brought against us by the plaintiffs rod and richard thornton and eagle drilling  llc 
we are actively seeking an appeal in this matter 
in june  the appellate court in the cms litigation reversed the original district court judgment 
pursuant to a settlement agreement  we paid cms million during july  which we accrued during the quarter ended june  bbep update in february  we received a quarterly distribution of million for the quarter ended december  in april  bbep announced that it was suspending its distributions to remain in compliance with certain provisions of its credit facility and to redirect cash flow to reduce its debt 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of equity earnings in bbep and an impairment of million

decreased market prices for natural gas in reduced revenue million  but this reduction was largely offset by a million increase from hedge settlements 
the increase in us natural gas volumes is due to wells placed into service principally in texas during these increases were partially offset by lower volumes resulting from the sale of a revenue interest in our alliance properties in june and natural production declines from existing texas wells 
canadian natural gas production increased due in part to the horn river basin wells placed into service during the third and fourth quarters of ngl revenue for decreased primarily due to lower realized ngl prices for as compared to realized ngl prices decreased despite the absence of million paid for hedge settlements in partially offsetting the price decrease were increases in production 
texas production increased due to wells placed into production during  lower field pressures and improved ngl recoveries from the corvette plant  which was placed into service by kgs during the first quarter of oil revenue for was lower than due to decreases in market prices and oil production for as compared to an increase in oil and condensate revenue from the absence of outlays for hedge settlements partially offset these decreases 
natural gas for increased as a result of both an increase in realized prices and an increase in volumes as compared to natural gas prices for increased significantly compared to and resulted in additional revenue of million that was partially offset by a million reduction in revenue because of the absence of hedge settlements during natural gas production in the us increased as a result of the impact of wells placed into production partially offset by production declines for existing texas wells 
the november divestiture of our northeast operations reduced our natural gas production while the alliance acquisition increased production by mmcfd 

table of contents ngl revenue for increased as a result of production increases and higher realized prices 
additional texas natural gas production in the high btu area of the barnett shale and processing improvements during increased ngl volumes when compared to realized prices included higher ngl market prices partially offset by lower revenue because of additional payments for hedge settlements 
partially offsetting the texas production and pricing increases was the absence of production from the divested northeast operations 
oil revenue for was higher than due to an increase in realized prices 
realized prices for oil increased in despite a reduction in revenue from hedge settlements 
production increases from texas wells in partially offset the absence of production from divested northeast operations 
sales of purchased natural gas and costs of purchased natural gas years ended december  in thousands sales of purchased natural gas purchases from eni purchases from others total costs of purchased natural gas sold purchases from eni purchases from others unrealized valuation loss on gas purchase commitment total net sales and purchases of natural gas our activities related to the purchase and sale of natural gas in texas are the result of natural gas sales and purchases transacted under the gas purchase commitment 
due to the nature of the gas purchase commitment  we have recognized  and will continue to recognize  unrealized gains and losses associated with our future commitment 
the gas purchase commitment is more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
other revenue other revenue  consisting primarily of revenue from the processing  gathering and marketing of natural gas and income attributable to hedge derivative ineffectiveness  was million for  which was million lower than for kgs third party revenue for the period was million less for when compared to additionally  gains attributable to partial ineffectiveness of derivatives hedging our canadian production were million less for when compared to other revenue was million for  an increase of million compared with throughput from third parties utilizing gathering and processing assets primarily operated by kgs increased other revenue by million 
partially offsetting the increase was the absence of million of canadian government grants for new drilling techniques we received in

canadian production expense for was unchanged from canadian production expense per mcfe for decreased because of production increases 
production expense on a canadian dollar basis for compared to increased approximately c million or due primarily to the canadian production increase 
oil and gas production expense for decreased slightly from the absence of production expense from the divested northeast operations was almost entirely offset by the growth of our operations in texas and canada that increased production expense in those areas as production volumes increased and  respectively  for as compared to  as discussed previously 
although oil and gas production expense for our texas operations was higher for  production expense per mcfe decreased when compared to the improvement in production expense on a mcfe basis was primarily the result of higher production levels  cost containment initiatives  new completion 
table of contents techniques used in our capital program and higher utilization of automation during canadian production expense increased primarily as a result of the increase in production volumes  an increase in personnel costs and higher prevailing exchange rates during production and ad valorem taxes years ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts per per per production and ad valorem taxes mcfe mcfe mcfe us canada total production and ad valorem taxes for reflect the addition of wells and midstream facilities in texas during although such costs were almost unchanged on a mcfe basis 
production and ad valorem tax expense for increased million as compared to us ad valorem and production taxes increased million due to the development of our texas properties  increased production and higher pricing 
this increase was nearly offset by the absence of million for production and ad valorem taxes associated with the divested northeast operations 
other operating expense the million increase in other operating expense for as compared to was primarily the result of commissioning and other operating expenses associated with the operation of our alliance midstream assets and other texas midstream operations not owned by kgs 
depletion  depreciation and accretion years ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts per per per mcfe mcfe mcfe depletion us canada total depletion us canada total depreciation accretion total depletion for was relatively unchanged from as production increases were almost entirely offset by lower depletion rates 
our us depletion expense increased due primarily to the increase in us production volumes 
both our us and canadian depletion rates were impacted by impairment charges 
us impairment charges were recognized in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of canadian impairment charges were recognized in the first  second and fourth quarters of changes in the us canadian dollar exchange rate also contributed to lower canadian depletion expense and the canadian depletion rate on a mcfe basis 
we expect that our consolidated depletion rate for will be in a range of to per mcfe 

table of contents the change in the exchange rate decreased depletion million when comparing to the million increase in us depreciation for as compared to was primarily associated with additions of fort worth basin field compression  alliance gathering and processing facilities and kgs gathering system in addition to kgs corvette plant that was placed into service in the first quarter of higher depletion expense for resulted from a increase in the depletion rate and a increase in production volumes 
our depletion rate was impacted by the addition of the proved oil and gas properties obtained in the alliance acquisition as well as the capital costs incurred for proved reserves added from our existing properties and increases in estimated future capital expenditures 
depreciation expense for was million higher than primarily due to additions of fort worth basin field compression and kgs midstream infrastructure  partially offset by the absence of million of depreciation expense associated with the divested northeast operations depreciable assets 
impairment of oil and gas properties as required under gaap  we perform quarterly ceiling tests to assess impairment of our oil and gas properties 
net capitalized costs include the book value of our oil and gas properties net of accumulated depletion and impairment  reduced by the related asset retirement obligations and deferred tax liabilities 
net capitalized costs are compared to the period end ceiling limitation  which is the sum of estimated future net cash flows  discounted at per annum  from proved reserves  based on an unweighted average of preceding month first day of the month prices for the year then ended year end prices for and adjusted to reflect local differentials  unescalated period end costs and expenses  adjusted for financial derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges of our oil and gas revenue  the costs of properties not being amortized  the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties not included in the costs being amortized  less income tax effects related to differences between book and tax bases of the oil and gas properties 
we recognized noncash pre tax charges totaling million million after tax for impairments related to both our us and canadian oil and gas properties in the primary factor that caused the decrease in the estimated future cash flows from our proved oil and gas reserves was lower benchmark natural gas prices at march  for the us and canada and further canadian price decreases at june  additionally  reductions in the expected canadian capital investment for the following and month periods at june  further decreased estimated canadian future net cash flows from our proved oil and gas reserves 
at september   the unamortized cost of our canadian oil and gas properties exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation by approximately million pre tax 
as permitted by full cost accounting rules in effect at that date  improvements in aeco spot natural gas prices subsequent to september  eliminated the necessity to record a charge for impairment 
use of the unweighted average of the preceding month first day of the month prices as required by the sec effective december   resulted in a fourth quarter impairment of our canadian oil and gas properties 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report contains additional information about the ceiling test calculation 
we recognized a noncash pre tax charge of million million after tax for impairment related to our us oil and gas properties in december the impairment charge was primarily a result of the significantly lower natural gas and ngl prices at year end as compared to year end 
table of contents general and administrative expense years ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts per per per general and administrative expense mcfe mcfe mcfe cash expense litigation resolution equity compensation total despite a decrease in litigation resolution costs  legal fees increased million because of our litigation with bbep  the eni transaction and various other corporate matters 
non cash expense for stock based compensation in increased million when compared to general and administrative expense for increased million  which included a charge of million in as a result of the settlement of litigation as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
the most significant increase in recurring general and administrative expense for was a million increase in employee compensation and benefits  including increases of million of non cash expense for stock based compensation and million in performance based compensation 
the remaining million increase in employee compensation is related to additional headcount hired to bring our infrastructure to a level needed to accommodate growth in our operations and production 
after consideration of the breitburn transaction investment banking fees of million recognized in  fees for legal  accounting and other professional services increased general and administrative expense by approximately million  which resulted from additional regulatory filing requirements  litigation costs  expenses associated with evaluation of complex business transactions and the full year effect of kgs being a publicly traded partnership 
other components of operating income during  we recognized a gain of million as a result of our divestiture of the northeast operations  and we recorded a loss on the michigan sales contract related to delivery of volumes in michigan 
further information regarding these transactions is included in note of our consolidated financial statements found in item of this annual report 
income from earnings of bbep during  we recognized million for equity earnings from our investment in bbep 
we record our portion of bbep s earnings during the quarter in which their financial statements become publicly available 
as a result  our annual results of operations include bbep s earnings for the months ended september  our results of operations reflect bbep s earnings from november   when we acquired bbep units  through september  the increase in equity earnings recognized during is primarily due to a significant reduction in unrealized losses from derivative instruments that bbep experienced compared with the prior year month period 
bbep has continued to experience significant volatility in its net earnings due to changes in value of its derivative instruments for which it does not employ hedge accounting 
we recognized million of income associated with the equity earnings from our investment in bbep in for the period november   when we acquired the bbep units  through september  this amount reflects our prevailing ownership interests for the applicable period before and after our ownership increased from to by virtue of bbep s purchase and retirement of units during impairment of investment in bbep during the first quarter of  we evaluated our investment in bbep for impairment in response to further decreases in prevailing commodity prices and bbep s unit price after december  as a result of these decreases  we made the determination that the decline in value was other than temporary 

table of contents accordingly  our impairment analysis  which utilized the march  closing price of per bbep unit  resulted in aggregate fair value of million for the portion of bbep units that we owned 
the million aggregate fair value was compared to the million carrying value of our investment in bbep 
we recorded the difference of million as an impairment charge during the first quarter of a similar analysis was performed at each subsequent quarter end of  which resulted in no further impairment 
note to our consolidated financial statements found in item of this annual report contains additional information regarding our investment in bbep 
during the fourth quarter of  our management considered the fair value of the bbep units along with the fair value trend of its peers  the trend and future petroleum strip prices and the limited availability of credit which occurred in the latter half of based on these factors  management determined that the decrease in fair value of bbep units was other than temporary and recorded a pre tax charge of million to reduce the carrying value of our investment in bbep to its fair value 
interest expense years ended december  in thousands interest costs on debt outstanding add non cash interest non cash loss on early debt extinguishment less interest capitalized interest expense amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount 
interest costs for were higher than primarily because of higher outstanding debt balances  which included the issuance of our senior notes due in june and our senior notes due in august the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes due were used to fully repay the senior secured second lien credit facility in june at that time  we recognized additional interest expense of million for the remaining unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs associated with the senior secured second lien facility 
interest rate swaps entered into in june partially offset increases of interest expense by million for we expect interest expense to be in a range of million to million for  based on current market conditions and expected borrowing levels 
interest expense for was higher than primarily because of higher average debt outstanding due to the issuance of our senior notes due and our senior secured second lien facility due in  partially offset by a decrease in our average consolidated interest rate 
the higher debt levels in relate to the alliance acquisition and the funding of the capital program 
the increase in capitalized interest related to more projects and costs within those projects being subject to capitalization 
interest was capitalized in for our exploration projects in the horn river basin and west texas and construction of the corvette plant by kgs 
income taxes years ended december  in thousands income tax expense benefit effective tax rate our income tax provision for changed from due to a million reduction of pre tax earnings that resulted primarily from higher aggregate impairment charges for our oil and gas properties 
table of contents recognized during when compared to the effective tax rate for was affected by the resulting taxable net loss in both the us and canada that were taxed at approximately and approximately  respectively 
the provision for income taxes changed dramatically from due to the loss generated by us operations for pre tax results for compared with were most significantly influenced by the impairment charges recognized on us oil and gas properties and on our investment in bbep 
also  results included the gain resulting from our divestiture of our northeast operations 
higher canadian pre tax income and the absence of tax credits received in increased the provision for income taxes in canada by million 
in  the effective rate exceeded the statutory rate of due to the benefit of lower taxes in canada partially offset by impact of permanent differences for executive compensation and meals and entertainment

in addition  our expenditures for gas processing and gathering assets have grown significantly as part of our growth in texas 
we completed several significant transactions over the three years ended december   including the eni transaction with net cash proceeds of million  our alliance acquisition for cash of billion and the divestiture of our northeast operations that resulted in cash proceeds of million 
we reduced our exploration and development activity from levels in response to lower natural gas and ngl prices 
of the million of cash paid for property  plant and equipment during  was invested in our oil and natural gas properties and was invested in our gas processing and gathering operations 
we drilled net wells in the fort worth basin and net wells in alberta 
our midstream capital investment of million was primarily related to expansion of our texas gas processing and gathering facilities 
our purchases of property  plant and equipment reflect our expansion in our core operating areas in texas and alberta 
in  we purchased approximately producing wells in the alliance acquisition and drilled net wells in texas and net wells in alberta 
additionally  the assets purchased in the alliance acquisition included a gathering system and we invested million and million for fort worth basin and canadian gas processing and gathering facilities  respectively

in  we drilled net wells in the fort worth basin and an additional net wells in alberta 
additionally  we invested million and million for texas and canadian gas processing and gathering facilities  respectively 
we currently estimate that our spending for property  plant and equipment in will be approximately million  of which we have allocated million for drilling and completion activities  including million in texas  million in canada and million in other areas in the us we have also budgeted million for gathering and processing facilities including million to be funded directly by kgs  million for acquisition of additional leasehold interests and million for other property and equipment

net cash flows from financing activities during were significantly impacted by the alliance acquisition and our capital program 
we funded our capital program in excess of operating cash flow through the issuance of our senior notes due and additional borrowing under our senior secured credit facility 
the alliance acquisition was funded by a million five year senior secured second lien facility and additional borrowing under our senior secured credit facility 
net cash flows from financing activities during were significantly impacted by the kgs ipo and the divestiture of our northeast operations 
the kgs ipo resulted in cash proceeds of million primarily used to repay debt 
the divestiture of our northeast operations generated net cash proceeds of million included in investing activities  however those proceeds were used to pay down debt previously outstanding which was reflected in financing cash flows 
liquidity and borrowing capacity our senior secured credit facility matures on february  the borrowing base at december  was billion which was the result of a redetermination in october the senior secured credit facility currently provides us an option to increase the commitment by up to million  with a maximum of billion with lender consents and additional commitments 
we can also extend the facility up to two additional years with lenders approval 
the borrowing base is subject to at least an annual redetermination 

table of contents the facility provides for revolving loans  swingline loans and letters of credit from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed the borrowing base which is calculated based on several factors 
the lenders commitments under the facility are allocated between us and canadian funds 
us borrowings under the facility are secured by  among other things  quicksilver s and our us subsidiaries oil and gas properties 
canadian borrowings under the facility are secured by  among other things  all of our oil and gas properties 
we also pledged our equity interests in bbep to secure our obligations under the senior secured credit facility 
at december   there was approximately million available under the facility 
in january  we repaid million of borrowings outstanding under the senior secured credit facility using the proceeds from the sale of the alliance midstream assets to kgs 
our ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenants in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control  including market prices for our products 
any future inability to comply with these covenants  unless waived by the requisite lenders  could adversely affect our liquidity by rendering us unable to borrow further under our credit facilities and by accelerating the maturity of our indebtedness 
the kgs credit agreement matures august   but may be extended up to two additional years with lenders approval 
in october  the lenders increased their commitments to a total of million 
at december   kgs had approximately million available under the kgs credit agreement 
the kgs credit agreement permits further expansion to as much as million  subject to lender consent and additional commitments 
kgs must maintain certain financial ratios that can limit its borrowing capacity 
kgs ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenants in its credit agreement may be affected by events beyond our or kgs control 
any future inability to comply with these covenants  unless waived by the requisite lenders  could adversely affect our liquidity by rendering kgs unable to borrow further under its credit agreement and by accelerating the maturity of its indebtedness 
kgs received million from the underwriters january exercise of their option to purchase an additional  units and repaid million of borrowings outstanding under the kgs credit agreement 
kgs also re borrowed million under the kgs credit agreement to fund kgs purchase of the alliance midstream assets 
additional information about our debt and related covenants are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
we believe that our capital resources are adequate to meet the requirements of our existing business 
we anticipate that our capital expenditure program of approximately million will be funded by cash flow from operations 
we may  from time to time during  make borrowings under the senior secured credit facility  but expect that for all of to require no incremental borrowings above levels 
conversely  we anticipate that kgs may experience increases to its outstanding borrowings to fund further development of its gathering and treating capacity in the alliance area 
depending upon conditions in the capital markets and other factors  we will from time to time consider the issuance of debt or other securities  other possible capital markets transactions or the sale of assets  the proceeds of which could be used to refinance current indebtedness or for other corporate purposes 
we will also consider from time to time additional acquisitions of  and investments in  assets or businesses that complement our existing asset portfolio 
acquisition transactions  if any  are expected to be financed through cash on hand and from operations  bank borrowings  the issuance of debt or other securities or a combination of those sources

our net open derivative position decreased million because of monthly settlements during and million received for early settlement of a derivative hedging a portion of our production 
the valuation of our open derivative positions at december  partially offset these decreases 
our current deferred income tax liability related to our derivatives was almost unchanged 
table of contents because of changes in the allocation of open derivative positions between the us and canada and the difference between us and canadian statutory tax rates 
our net property  plant and equipment balance decreased million from december  to december  during  we recorded charges for impairment of our oil and gas properties of million and dd a expense of million 
our property  plant and equipment balances were also decreased by proceeds of million for the eni transaction 
these decreases were partially offset by million of costs incurred for property  plant and equipment  and an additional million for changes to us canadian exchange rates and assets recognized when retirement obligations were established for new wells and facilities 
our deferred income tax liability has decreased million and a us deferred tax asset of million was recognized in connection with the impairments of both our investment in bbep and our us oil and gas properties 
equity held by noncontrolling interests increased million  which consisted of million from the kgs secondary offering  employee unit compensation of million and income attributable to noncontrolling interests of million partially offset by million of distributions paid to noncontrolling interests 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations 
information regarding our contractual and scheduled interest obligations  at december   is set forth in the following table 
payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands long term debt scheduled interest obligations transportation and processing contracts drilling rig contracts gas purchase commitment purchase obligations asset retirement obligations unrecognized tax benefits operating lease obligations total obligations long term debt 
as of december   our outstanding indebtedness included million outstanding under our senior secured credit facility  million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due  million of senior subordinated notes  million of contingently convertible debentures and million outstanding under the kgs credit facility all before original issue discount 
based upon our debt outstanding and interest rates in effect at december   we anticipate interest payments  including our scheduled interest obligations  to be approximately million in although we do not expect year over year increased borrowings under our senior secured credit facility during  should we be required to increase those borrowings and based on interest rates in effect at december   an additional million in borrowings would result in additional annual interest payments of approximately million 
if the current borrowing base under our senior secured credit facility were to be fully utilized by year end at interest rates in effect at december   we estimate that annual interest payments would increase by approximately million 
if interest rates on our december  variable debt balances of approximately billion  including million subject to fixed to 
table of contents floating interest rate swaps  increase or decrease by one percentage point  our annual pre tax income would decrease or increase by million 
scheduled interest obligations 
as of december   we had scheduled interest payments of million annually on our senior notes due  million annually on our senior notes due  million annually on our senior notes due  million annually on our million of senior subordinated notes and million annually on our million of contingently convertible debentures 
additional interest of million and million is payable in on the senior secured credit facility and kgs credit agreement  respectively 
transportation and processing contracts 
under contracts with various pipeline and processing companies  we are obligated to provide minimum daily natural gas volumes for transport or processing  as calculated on a monthly basis  or pay for any volume deficiencies at a specified reservation fee rate 
our production committed to the pipelines or processing plants is expected to meet  or exceed  the daily volumes provided in the contracts 
drilling rig contracts 
we utilize drilling rigs from third parties in our development and exploration programs 
the outstanding drilling rig contracts require payment of a specified day rate ranging from  to  for the entire lease term regardless of our utilization of the drilling rigs 
gas purchase commitment 
pursuant to the eni transaction we agreed to purchase eni s share of alliance leasehold production at per mmbtu less costs related to gathering and processing eni s alliance production through december purchase obligations 
at december   we and kgs were under contract to purchase goods and services for use in field and gas plant operations 
kgs remaining cash obligations for such items were million 
asset retirement obligations 
our obligations result from the acquisition  construction or development and the normal operation of our long lived assets 
unrecognized tax benefits 
we have recorded obligations that have resulted from tax benefit claims in our tax returns that do not meet the recognition standard of more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
the million balance of unrecognized tax benefits includes million of amounts that  if recognized  would reduce our effective tax rate 
operating lease obligations 
we lease office buildings and other property under operating leases 
commercial commitments 
we had the following commercial commitments as of december  amounts of commitments by expiration period less than more than total year years years years in thousands surety bonds standby letters of credit total surety bonds 
our surety bonds have been issued to fulfill contractual  legal or regulatory requirements 
surety bonds generally have an annual renewal option

all of these letters of credit were issued under our senior secured credit facility and generally have an annual renewal option 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future 
table of contents events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ materially from our assumptions and estimates 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 
oil and gas reserves policy description proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil  natural gas  and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
in december  the sec adopted its final rule for modernization of oil and gas reporting 
the most significant changes incorporated into our proved reserve process and related disclosures for include the use of an unweighted average of the preceding month first day of the month prices for determination of proved reserve values included in calculating full cost ceiling limitations and for annual proved reserve disclosures  consideration of and limitations on the types of technologies that may be used to reliably establish and estimate proved reserves  reporting of investments and progress made during the year to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves  and  reporting on the independence and qualifications of our personnel and independent petroleum engineers who are responsible for the preparation of our reserve estimates 
operating costs are the period end operating cost at the time of the reserve estimate and held constant 
our estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed at least annually using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
revisions may result from changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 
our proved reserve estimates and related disclosures for are presented in compliance with this new guidance 
our and proved reserve estimates and related disclosures were prepared in compliance with the sec guidance then in effect 
additional information regarding our estimated proved oil and gas reserves may be found under oil and natural gas reserves found in item of this annual report 
judgments and assumptions all of the reserve data in this annual report are based on estimates 
estimates of our oil  natural gas and ngl reserves are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating recoverable underground accumulations of oil  natural gas and ngls 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating recoverable quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves 
uncertainties include the projection of future production rates and the expected timing of development expenditures 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil  natural gas and ngls that are ultimately recovered 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
the weighted average annual revisions to our 
table of contents reserve estimates have been less than of the weighted average previous year s estimate excluding revisions due to price changes 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  it could result in a ceiling test related impairment 
in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling limitation  estimation of proved reserves is also a significant component of the calculation of depletion expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the depletion rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
full cost ceiling calculations policy description we use the full cost method to account for our oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method  all costs associated with the development  exploration and acquisition of oil and gas properties are capitalized and accumulated in cost centers on a country by country basis 
this includes any internal costs that are directly related to development and exploration activities  but does not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
proceeds received from disposals are credited against accumulated cost except when the sale represents a significant disposal of reserves  in which case a gain or loss is calculated and recognized 
the application of the full cost method generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion rates compared to its alternative  the successful efforts method 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs for each cost center is depleted on the equivalent unit of production basis using estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
excluded from amounts subject to depletion are costs associated with unevaluated properties 
under the full cost method  net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost reduced by the related net deferred tax liability and asset retirement obligations or the cost center ceiling 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of estimated future net revenue  discounted at per annum  from proved reserves  based on the unweighted average of the preceding month first day of the month prices year end prices for and adjusted to reflect local differentials and contract provisions  unescalated year end costs and financial derivatives that hedge the our oil and gas revenue  the cost of properties not being amortized  the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized less income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax bases of the oil and gas properties 
if the net book value reduced by the related net deferred income tax liability and asset retirement obligations exceeds the cost center ceiling limitation  a non cash impairment charge is required 
judgments and assumptions the discounted present value of future net cash flows from our proved oil  natural gas and ngl reserves is the major component of the ceiling calculation  and is determined in connection with the estimation of our proved oil  natural gas and ngl reserves 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of reserve estimation requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of natural gas  ngl and oil reserves  and the applicable discount rate  that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
current sec rules require the use of the future net cash flows from proved reserves discounted at 
therefore  the future net cash flows associated with the estimated proved reserves is not based on our assessment of future prices or costs 
in calculating the ceiling  we adjust the future net cash flows by the discounted value of derivative contracts in place that hedge future prices 
this valuation is determined by calculating the difference between reserve pricing and the contract prices for such hedges also discounted at 
because the ceiling calculation dictates that our historical experience  excluding the effects of benefits derived from our ownership of kgs  be held constant indefinitely and requires a discount factor  the resulting value is not necessarily indicative of the fair value of the reserves or the oil and gas properties 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile 
at any period end  forecasted prices can be either 
table of contents substantially higher or lower than our historical experience 
also  marginal borrowing rates may be well below the required used in the calculation 
rates below  if they could be utilized  would have the effect of increasing the otherwise calculated ceiling amount 
therefore  oil and gas property ceiling test related impairments that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation  and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves  should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 
derivative instruments policy description we enter into financial derivative instruments to mitigate risk associated with the prices received from our production 
we may also utilize financial derivative instruments to hedge the risk associated with interest rates on our outstanding debt 
we account for our derivative instruments by recognizing qualifying derivative instruments on our balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value determined by reference to published future market prices and interest rates 
for derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portions of gains or losses are deferred in other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings during the period in which the hedged transactions are realized 
gains or losses on qualified derivative instruments terminated prior to their original expiration date are deferred and recognized as income or expense in the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized 
if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring  the deferred gain or loss would be immediately recorded to earnings 
the ineffective portion of the hedge relationship is recognized currently as a component of other revenue 
the fair values of our natural gas and ngl derivatives and the gas purchase commitment as of december  were estimated using published market prices of natural gas and ngls for the periods covered by the contracts 
estimates were determined by applying the net differential between the prices in each derivative and commitment and market prices for future periods  to the volumes stipulated in each contract to arrive at an estimated value of future cash flow streams 
these estimated future cash flow values were then discounted for each contract at rates commensurate with federal treasury instruments with similar contractual lives to arrive at estimated fair value 
for derivative instruments that qualify as fair value hedges the gains or losses on the derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings while the gains or losses on the hedged items adjust the carrying value of the hedged items and are recognized currently in earnings 
any gains or losses on the derivative instruments not offset by the gains or losses on the hedged items are recognized as the value of ineffectiveness in the hedge relationships 
for interest rate swaps that qualify as fair value hedges of our fixed rate debt outstanding  ineffectiveness is recognized currently as a component of interest expense 
the fair value of our interest rate derivatives was estimated using published libor interest rates for the periods covered by the contracts 
the estimates were determined by applying the net differential between the interest rate in each derivative and interest rates for future periods  to the notional amount stipulated in each contract to arrive at estimated future cash flow streams 
judgments and assumptions the estimates of the fair values of our commodity and interest rate derivative instruments require substantial judgment 
valuations are based upon multiple factors such as futures prices  volatility data from major oil and gas trading points  time to maturity and interest rates 
we compare our estimates of fair value for these instruments with valuations obtained from independent third parties and counterparty valuation confirmations 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results 
future changes to forecasted or realized commodity prices could result in significantly different values and realized cash flows for such instruments 

table of contents stock based compensation policy description an estimate of fair value is determined for all share based payment awards 
recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards is recognized over the vesting period for each award 
judgments and assumptions option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
income taxes policy description deferred income taxes are established for all temporary differences between the book and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
in addition  deferred tax balances must be adjusted to reflect tax rates that we expect will be in effect during years in which we expect the temporary differences will reverse 
canadian taxes are computed at rates in effect or expected to be in effect in canada 
us deferred tax liabilities are not recognized on profits that are expected to be permanently reinvested in canada and thus are not considered available for distribution to us 
net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets are reviewed annually for recoverability  and if necessary  are recorded net of a valuation allowance 
judgments and assumptions we must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and provide judgment on the amount of financial statement benefit that an uncertain tax position will realize upon ultimate settlement 
to the extent that we believe that a more than probability exists that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and in determining the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of the evidence  a valuation allowance is needed and consider the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit 
evidence used for the valuation allowance includes information about our current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years  as well as all currently available information about future years  including our anticipated future performance  the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax planning strategies available to us 
to the extent that a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position is established or changed during any period  we would recognize expense or benefit within our consolidated tax expense 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of item a of sec regulation s k

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we enter into financial derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future production and to increase the predictability of our revenue 
as of december   forecasted natural gas production of mmcfd has been hedged with natural gas price collars and mbbld of forecasted ngl production has been hedged with ngl price swaps for additionally  mmcfd of natural gas price collars and mbbld of ngl price swaps have been executed to hedge anticipated production and mmcfd of anticipated natural gas production has been hedged using natural gas price collars 
utilization of our financial hedging program will most often result in realized prices from the sale of our natural gas  ngl and oil that vary from market prices 
as a result of settlements of derivative contracts  our revenue from natural gas  ngl and oil production was million higher for  million lower for and million higher for  respectively

the remaining gas purchase commitment is adjusted to fair value throughout the period of the commitment  which expires on december  we recognized a million increase in the remaining liability between june and december  and recorded a valuation loss as a component of costs of purchased natural gas 
at december   we had a remaining liability of million  including the million liability for the change in value since initial valuation 
the following summarizes activity to the gas purchase commitment in thousands initial valuation of liability decrease due to gas volumes purchased embedded derivative increase decrease due to price changes volume changes total embedded derivative balance at december  initial valuation of the gas purchase commitment was estimated using estimated eni production volumes from june  through december and published future market prices and risk adjusted interest rates as of june  interest rate risk the interest income or expense from our interest rate swaps is accrued as earned and recorded as an adjustment to the interest expense accrued on two fixed rate debt issues  our senior notes due and our senior subordinated notes 
these interest rate swaps qualified and were accounted for as fair value hedges 
during settlements under the interest rate swaps decreased interest expense by million  which resulted in average effective interest rates of approximately and on the senior notes due and the senior subordinated debt  respectively 
in february  we executed early settlement of our interest rate swaps on our senior notes due and our senior subordinated notes 
we received cash of million in the settlement  which has been recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the debt and will be amortized to earnings over the life of the associated underlying debt instruments 
we subsequently entered into new interest rate swaps on our senior notes due and our senior subordinated notes that convert the interest paid on those issues from a fixed to a floating rate indexed to six month libor 
the maturity dates and all other significant terms are the same as those of the underlying debt 
as a result  these interest rate swaps qualified for hedge accounting treatment as fair value hedges 
foreign currency risk our canadian subsidiary uses the canadian dollar as its functional currency 
to the extent that business transactions in canada are not denominated in canadian dollars  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
for  and  non functional currency transactions resulted in losses of million  million and million  respectively  included in net earnings 
furthermore  the senior secured credit facility permits canadian borrowings to be made in either us or canadian denominated amounts 
however  the aggregate borrowing capacity of the entire facility is calculated using the us dollar equivalent 
accordingly  there is a risk that exchange rate movements could impact our available borrowing capacity
