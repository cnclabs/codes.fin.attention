key overall strategies applebee s key strategies we are in the process of a three to five year effort to revitalize the applebee s brand 
in  we accomplished the following under each key strategy drive profitable sales and traffic continued to focus on value throughout through our for offering  which emerged as one of the most recognized and regarded value propositions in casual dining  re engineered our new product development process  rebuilding our innovation infrastructure and organizational capabilities  launched a new campaign featuring the tagline there s no place like the neighborhood

table of contents introduced a line of healthy food and beverage offerings through a totally integrated marketing communications approach  including network television  national visibility platform  local support  social media  website support and public relations  and developed a new menu design  engineered to increase profitability and make menu decisions easier for our guests 
the new menu was implemented across the system in early improve margins and unit level economics we implemented numerous initiatives to improve the operations and profitability of applebee s company operated restaurants  resulting in a basis point profit margin improvement from the prior year 
the improved margins resulted from introduction of labor deployment tools  food and beverage cost improvement initiatives and better control over other costs 
the margin improvements were not at the expense of the guest as we achieved all time high guest satisfaction scores 
we also refined our franchisee operations rating system to provide greater visibility to our franchisees concerning their performance in relation to guest experience  food safety and training 
transform the business the company remains committed to our strategy to franchise a substantial majority of the company operated restaurants to buyers who are financially qualified  share our vision for revitalizing the applebee s brand  are willing to invest in the business  and have well qualified management teams

we anticipate it will take several years to be completed and will continue to focus on optimizing the performance of the business in a challenging economic environment and a highly competitive casual dining category  there can be no assurance that the strategies described above  when implemented  will achieve the intended results  including the franchising of the remaining applebee s domestic company operated restaurants  within the time frame described above 
ihop s key strategies we pursue growth through a three part strategic framework energize the ihop brand  improve operations performance  and maximize franchise development 
energize the ihop brand we seek to energize our brand by continuing our come hungry 
leave happy advertising campaign 
this message has successfully resonated with our guests for almost seven years and we expect to continue with this campaign in the future 
in  we also initiated the strategy of limited time offers on promotional products 
since that time  we have enhanced our execution of this promotional product approach by improving the appeal of these promotions and the franchisees execution 
in addition  we seek to enhance our media strategies to emphasize national advertising on broadcast  cable and syndicated television and strengthen our product promotion process 
over the last two years  we have shifted the allocation of our media spending towards national advertising 
due to this reallocation from local to national advertising  in we were able to provide continuous media support for all national initiatives  such as limited time offers  and secondary messages  such as ihop for dinner  gift cards and kids eat free 
we developed new prototype and remodel programs in  which have become the standards for all development and remodel activity going forward 
by the end of  substantially all franchisees have completed their remodels under this program 
we also launched our ihop n go takeout program in february and a successful gift card program in in order to ensure that we remain 
table of contents relevant with our customers and meet their changing dining patterns 
in  we expanded the scope of our gift card program by utilizing third party retailers to market our gift cards 
improve operations performance we will continue to improve the operations of the restaurants 
during  we established an ihop franchisee grading system to evaluate the operational standards of each of our restaurant units 
this franchisee grading system is a comprehensive scorecard that covers mystery shop scores  operational assessment scores and health department ratings  among other things 
by december   of all franchisees had received grades of a or b for their restaurants 
in addition  we intend to continue focusing on making exceptional service a priority for franchisees by providing tools for improved restaurant execution  while highlighting our motto service as good as our pancakes 
substantially all ihop restaurants are using pollable point of sale pos systems to capture and report a broad range of sales and product mix data 
this information is used by management to  among other things  gauge guest acceptance of menu items and the success of promotions and limited time offers 
maximize franchise development under the current business model  ihop seeks to maximize franchise development by emphasizing the recruitment of franchise developers within and outside the current system in order to grow its revenues 
we have a strong existing franchisee base 
since  more than of new restaurants have been opened by pre existing franchisees 
this strategy has proven very successful as franchisees have developed approximately units since the inception of the current business model and we have a pipeline of additional new units committed  optioned or pending 
in addition  we may take steps to intervene  consolidate  and rehabilitate existing markets if we believe that doing so is advisable in order to fully realize development potential 
in a challenging economic environment and a highly competitive family dining category  there can be no assurance that the strategies described above  when implemented  will achieve the intended results within the time frame anticipated 
significant known events  trends or uncertainties impacting or expected to impact comparisons of reported or future results economic uncertainties during  the recession that followed last year s global economic decline and financial market disruption continued to impact the us economy and the economies of most countries worldwide 
consumers continue to be faced with general economic uncertainty fueled by difficult consumer credit markets  softness in both the commercial and residential real estate markets  high unemployment and lagging consumer confidence 
while the financial market disruption of has abated  we believe financial market volatility  high unemployment  foreclosures and lower valuations for residential real estate will continue to put pressure on consumer spending 
these conditions make it challenging for us to accurately forecast and plan for future business activities as the reduction in disposable income for discretionary spending could cause our customers to change historic purchasing behavior and choose lower cost dining options or alternatives to dining out 
this economic uncertainty may affect our business and operations in a number of ways  including but not limited to lower profitability and cash flows from company operated restaurants  
table of contents reduced cash flows from franchisees due to both a lower sales base on which royalties and other payments are calculated and possible impairment of the ability of franchisees to make payments when due as a result of the economic effects cited above on their businesses  reduced availability of financing for franchisees to fulfill their new restaurant development commitments  limited or lack of credit availability for potential purchasers of applebee s company operated restaurants  lower proceeds from the franchising of applebee s company operated restaurants due to both lower restaurant sales and profitability and or inability to consummate transactions at all  and lower estimated fair values for goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets resulting in future non cash impairment charges 
we cannot predict the effect or duration of this economic slowdown or the timing and strength of a subsequent recovery in the economy in general or the restaurant industry in particular 
if our business significantly deteriorates due to these macroeconomic effects  our financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 
fifty three week fiscal year our fiscal year ends on the sunday nearest to december of each year 
as a result  every five or six years our fiscal year contains calendar weeks 
fiscal contained weeks whereas fiscal and each contained weeks 
the estimated impact of the rd week in fiscal in comparison to fiscal was an increase in revenue of million  an increase in segment profit of million and an increase in income before income taxes of million 
while certain expenses increased in direct relationship to additional revenue from the rd week  other costs for example  depreciation and other fixed costs are incurred on a calendar month basis 
therefore  the impact of the additional week is not necessarily indicative of a typical relationship of expenses to revenues measured over a longer period of comparison  such as a fiscal month or a fiscal quarter 
securitized debt and related interest expense certain of our subsidiaries incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness to finance the applebee s acquisition 
because of early retirement of debt and a decline in variable interest rates  our interest expense decreased million from the prior year 
while it is not likely interest rates on our variable rate debt will continue to decline significantly below current levels and may  in fact  increase in the future  we will amortize debt in the normal course of business and we intend to use excess operating cash flow to repurchase debt when the opportunity is available 
as a result we expect our total interest expense will decline 
we estimate our interest expense for fiscal will range from million to million  which includes million of non cash interest charges 
however  interest expense is expected to remain as one of the largest components of costs and expenses in the future until such time that debt balances are repaid 

table of contents significant gains and charges there were several significant gains and charges that affect the comparisons of fiscal year results with previously reported periods  as presented in the following table year ended december  in millions impairment and closure charges gain loss on extinguishment of debt gain loss on disposition of assets loss on derivative financial instrument each transaction is discussed in further detail under paragraphs captioned with those descriptions elsewhere in item given the uncertainty as to the achievement of the forecasts used in assessing possible impairment of tangible and intangible assets  it is reasonably possible that impairment charges may occur in future periods 
while the fair value of our debt is currently less than its carrying value see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  the difference between fair value and carrying value has decreased considerably over the past year 
therefore  while we expect to continue to dedicate a portion of excess cash flow towards opportunistic debt retirement  it is likely that gains on future extinguishments of debt will be smaller than those recognized in and  if they occur at all 
financial statement effect of franchising company operated restaurants we have franchised applebee s company operated restaurants since the second quarter of and are planning to franchise a significant majority of the remaining company operated applebee s over the next several years 
as the number of company operated restaurants declines  the amount of company restaurant revenues and company restaurant expenses in future periods will decline significantly compared to amounts reported in previous periods 
franchise royalty revenues and expenses will likely increase as company operated restaurants are franchised  although not in the same magnitude as the company restaurant revenues decline as franchise royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisee s revenues 
additionally  under terms of the securitized debt agreements  all of the proceeds from asset sales must be used to retire long term debt at face value  which would result in a decrease in interest expense in the future 
restaurant data the following table sets forth  for each of the past three years  the number of effective restaurants in the applebee s and ihop systems and information regarding the percentage change in sales at those restaurants compared to the same period in the prior year 
applebee s information for is comprised of data from the month period prior to the acquisition date of november  and one month of applebee s data subsequent to the acquisition date pro forma

sales of restaurants that are owned by franchisees and area licensees are not attributable to the company 
however  we believe that presentation of this information is useful in analyzing our revenues because franchisees and area licensees pay us royalties and advertising fees that are generally based on a percentage of their sales  as well as  in some cases  rental payments under leases that are usually based on a percentage of their sales

the company believes that the decline experienced in comparable guest traffic is reflective of the current adverse economic conditions affecting customers and impacting the restaurant industry as a whole 
the increase in ihop franchise expenses is due to the costs of sales associated with the increased revenues from pancake and waffle dry mix sales and franchise advertising fees 
applebee s franchise expenses are relatively smaller than ihop s due to advertising expenses 
franchise fees designated for ihop s national advertising fund and local marketing and advertising cooperatives are recognized as revenue and expense of franchise operations  however  applebee s national advertising fund and local advertising cooperatives constitute agency transactions and therefore are not recognized as franchise revenue and expense

improvements in specific cost categories were as follows food and beverage costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales decreased primarily due to increased vendor discounts and rebates partially offset by an increase in commodity costs 
labor costs as a percentage of restaurant sales benefited from a reduction in management incentive expense due to retention costs in that did not recur  improvements in hourly labor from effective wage rate management and improved productivity  and lower group insurance costs

s gaap  goodwill must be evaluated for impairment  at a minimum  on an annual basis  and more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  events or circumstances such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  adverse legal or regulatory developments  or a significant decline in the market price of the company s common stock 
in the process of the annual impairment review  we primarily use the income approach method of valuation that uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of reporting units 
significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include future trends in sales  operating expenses  overhead expenses  depreciation  capital expenditures  and changes in working capital  along with an appropriate discount rate 
during the course of fiscal  we made periodic assessments as to whether there were indicators of impairment  particularly with respect to the significant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flow model  and determined an interim test of goodwill was not warranted 
accordingly  we performed the annual test of goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of in performing the test  the company revised downwards the same store sales change assumption in its five year forecast that had been used in the prior year 
the company also revised downward the assumed discount rate 
in performing the first step of the impairment test  the estimated fair value of both the ihop and applebee s franchised restaurant units exceeded their respective carrying values and it was concluded there was no impairment of goodwill 
the goodwill that had been allocated to the applebee s company operated restaurants unit was fully impaired in a significant majority of our goodwill arose from the november  acquisition of applebee s  million of goodwill resulted from a prior transaction related to the ihop franchised restaurants unit 
we allocated the goodwill from the acquisition to two reporting units  the applebee s company operated restaurants unit the company unit and the applebee s franchised restaurants unit applebee s franchise unit 
consistent with our intent to franchise the significant majority of the company operated applebee s restaurants acquired  we determined the fair value of the company unit for purposes of assigning goodwill to be the estimated sales value of the restaurants  the value that a market participant would have paid to purchase the restaurants on the day following the acquisition 
the fair value of the company unit was based on a multiple of approximately six times the operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months of the company unit 
this multiple was supported by actual refranchising transactions negotiated within a month after the acquisition 
the fair value of the franchise unit was determined using a discounted cash flow based on forecast royalty revenues from the franchise operations 
these fair values  which reconciled to the overall purchase price paid to acquire 
table of contents applebee s  were then used to assign goodwill between the reporting units as the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value as of november  of each reporting unit 
during the course of fiscal  we made periodic assessments as to whether there were indicators of impairment  particularly with respect to the significant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flow model 
those assessments included consideration of the uncertainty with respect to the depth and duration of the economic slowdown and the timing of a recovery  and the fact that the company was in the process of implementing several initiatives designed to improve applebee s same store sales and margin performance 
these assessments concluded that the sales forecasts being used to assess potential impairment were achievable within ranges that did not indicate impairment 
we therefore determined an interim test of goodwill during the first three quarters of was not warranted 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed the annual test for impairment of goodwill  utilizing a discounted cash flows model of the income approach as described above 
the impairment test of goodwill of the two applebee s units was performed as of october  the impairment test of the goodwill of the ihop unit was performed as of december   the date as of which the analysis has been performed in prior years 
towards the latter part of  while there was still considerable uncertainty with respect to the economic slowdown  the prevailing view was that a recovery was not likely to begin until the latter half of or early therefore  during the fourth quarter of  we revised downward our forecasted sales assumption for which also impacted the assumed cash flows for both and the following time period due to an assumed lower base from which the time period had originally been projected 
we also revised our projections with respect to both the estimated timing and estimated proceeds to be received from the franchising of applebee s company operated restaurants 
the first step of the impairment test compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to their carrying value 
based on this first step  we concluded that the fair value of the ihop unit and the applebee s franchise unit was in excess of their respective net carrying values and no impairment of goodwill was warranted 
however  because of downward revisions to the sales forecast and to franchising proceeds  the fair value of the applebee s company unit was less than the net carrying value of its assets assigned  requiring the second step of the impairment test 
in performing the second step of the impairment test we concluded that the goodwill allocated to the applebee s company unit was fully impaired and an impairment charge of million was recorded 
no tax benefit was associated with the impairment of goodwill 
subsequent to the annual test of impairment as of october   the commercial real estate market continued to weaken  the credit markets continued constrained  economic forecasts were uncertain as to how long the recessionary period would last  and the company s stock price declined 
we concluded an interim test of goodwill of the applebee s franchise unit was warranted 
we again revised the significant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flow model and updated our impairment analysis of the applebee s franchise unit as of december  the company determined the fair value of the applebee s franchise unit was still in excess of its carrying value as of december  and no impairment was required 
tradename impairment in accordance with us gaap  indefinite lived intangible assets must be evaluated for impairment  at a minimum  on an annual basis  and more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  events or circumstances such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  adverse legal or regulatory developments  or a significant decline in the market price of the company s common stock 
in performing the impairment review of the tradename intangible asset  the company 
table of contents primarily uses the relief of royalty method under the income approach method of valuation 
significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the relief of royalty method include future trends in sales  a royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the forecast revenue stream 
during the course of fiscal  the company made periodic assessments as to whether there were indicators of impairment  particularly with respect to the significant assumptions noted above 
in the first half of the year  same store sales trends were within the range of the forecast used in the assessment 
during the third quarter of  same store sales trended below the forecast range  however  during there were also indications that a lessening of underlying risk might result in a lower discount rate as well 
as a result of these assessments  the company determined an interim test of indefinite lived intangibles was not necessary 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed the annual test of impairment for indefinite lived intangibles  primarily the applebee s tradename assigned in the purchase price allocation 
the company revised downwards two key assumptions in its five year forecast the same store sales change and the assumed discount rate 
all other assumptions used in the relief from royalty calculation were unchanged from the prior year 
as the result of the revised assumptions  the estimated fair value of the tradename was less than the carrying value and an impairment of million was recognized  along with a related tax benefit of million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed an impairment test of its indefinite lived intangible assets  primarily the applebee s tradename assigned in the purchase price allocation 
we utilized the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the fair value of the tradename 
we determined the fair value of the tradename as of december  was less than the carrying value 
an impairment charge of million was recorded with a tax benefit of million associated with the charge 
long lived tangible asset impairment on a quarterly basis  the company assesses whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of tangible long lived assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of a restaurant s assets is measured by comparing the assets carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the assets remaining useful life or remaining lease term  whichever is less 
if the total expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  this may be an indicator of impairment 
if it is decided that there has been an impairment  the carrying amount of the asset is written down to the estimated fair value 
the fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows based on our cost of capital 
in performing these assessments throughout  the company recognized impairments of long lived tangible assets of million 
the impaired assets comprised three ihop company operated restaurants  various assets related to one ihop franchise restaurant  one applebee s company operated restaurant  a write down to the estimated sales value based on a current letter of intent of one applebee s restaurant that had been closed in a prior period and included in assets held for sale as of december  and four parcels of applebee s real estate 
the company had fee ownership of the properties on which four applebee s company operated restaurants were located

the company s strategy does not contemplate retaining such properties as a lessor on a long term basis

table of contents in june  the company entered into a sale leaseback transaction relating to parcels of real estate comprising land  buildings and improvements 
the net book value of the real estate exceeded the proceeds received by million 
all of the parcels involved in the transactions had been acquired in the november  acquisition of applebee s and their estimated fair value was assigned as part of the purchase price allocation as of that date 
the company evaluated events subsequent to november  and noted a deterioration in both the domestic real estate and credit markets between the date of the purchase price allocation and the june closing date of the sale leaseback transactions 
in the absence of objective evidence to the contrary  the company concluded that the estimated fair value of the real estate determined in the purchase price allocation had been reasonable  and the decline in value related primarily to market events subsequent to the acquisition date necessitating an impairment charge as opposed to an adjustment to the allocated purchase price 
the company evaluated whether this charge  in addition to other macroeconomic data and the decline in the market price of the company s common stock  were indicators of potential impairment of its goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets 
the company concluded that they were not indicators  because i the impairment charge was related to a specific transaction that resulted in the disposal of the majority of the company s real estate  ii applebee s june  year to date same store sales for company operated stores had increased slightly compared with the same period of the prior year  iii while directionally the us economy was slowing down  there was considerable uncertainty as to the depth and duration of the slowdown  such that the company believed its internal forecasts of same store sales growth were achievable  and iv the company s net book value was in excess of its market capitalization throughout the period up to and including the date of filing its form q for the quarterly period ending june  as part of the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of its long lived assets  the company recorded impairment charges of million for the three month period ended september  of that amount  million related to applebee s properties and primarily resulted from a continuing deterioration in credit markets in general and a decline in operating results of applebee s company operated restaurants expected to be franchised in particular geographic areas 
the remainder of the impairment related to an individual underperforming ihop property whose estimates of future cash flows indicated that the carrying value would not be recovered 
the company again evaluated whether the impairment charges taken in the third quarter of  in addition to other macroeconomic data and the decline in the market price of the company s common stock  were an indicator of potential impairment of its goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets 
the company concluded that they were not an indicator  because i the impairments were related to specific transactions in three geographic markets characterized as having a larger proportion of underperforming restaurants than the other geographic markets in which the remaining company operated restaurants are located  ii while applebee s year to date september  same store sales for company operated stores had decreased slightly compared with the same period of the prior year  the company was in the process of implementing several initiatives designed to improve the same store sales and did not believe there had been enough time to adequately assess the effectiveness of those initiatives  iii while economic data confirmed that the us economy had been recessionary since december of  there was still considerable uncertainty as to the depth and duration of the slowdown  and although applebee s year to date same store sales were lower than the prior period  applebee s decline had been less than its competitors  such that the company believed its internal forecasts of same store sales growth were achievable  and iv the company s net book value was in excess of its market capitalization throughout the third quarter ended september   and while the market capitalization did decline below the company s net book value subsequent to september   by the october  date of filing its form q for the quarterly period ending september   the company s net book value was in excess of its market capitalization

table of contents franchise restaurant retail sales are sales recorded at restaurants that are owned by franchisees and area licensees and are not attributable to the company 
franchise restaurant retail sales are useful in analyzing our franchise revenues because franchisees and area licensees pay us royalties and other fees that are generally based on a percentage of their sales 
effective restaurants are the number of restaurants in a given fiscal period adjusted to account for restaurants open for only a portion of the period

the increase in ihop franchise expenses was primarily a result of the increase in ihop franchise restaurant retail sales  in addition to an increase in the amount of financial relief granted to ihop franchisees 
these increases were partially offset by lower bad debt expense 
applebee s franchise expenses are relatively smaller than ihop s due to advertising expenses 
franchise fees designated for ihop s national advertising fund and local marketing and advertising cooperatives are recognized as revenue and expense of franchise operation  however  applebee s national advertising fund and local advertising cooperatives constitute agency transactions and therefore are not recognized as franchise revenue and expense

table of contents same store sales for company operated stores had decreased slightly compared with the same period of the prior year  the company was in the process of implementing several initiatives designed to improve the same store sales and did not believe there had been enough time to adequately assess the effectiveness of those initiatives  iii while economic data confirmed that the us economy had been recessionary since december of  there was still considerable uncertainty as to the depth and duration of the slowdown  and although applebee s year to date same store sales were lower than the prior period  applebee s decline had been less than its competitors  such that the company believed its internal forecasts of same store sales growth were achievable  and iv the company s net book value was in excess of its market capitalization throughout the third quarter ended september   and while the market capitalization did decline below the company s net book value subsequent to september   by the october  date of filing its form q for the quarterly period ending september   the company s net book value was in excess of its market capitalization 
in the fourth quarter of  the company completed its annual test for impairment of goodwill 
we utilized a discounted cash flows model of the income approach to assess the fair value of our three reporting units  the ihop franchised restaurants unit ihop unit  applebee s company operated restaurants unit applebee s company unit and applebee s franchised restaurants unit applebee s franchise unit 
the impairment test of goodwill of the two applebee s units which hold the significant majority of the total goodwill was performed as of october  the impairment test of the goodwill of the ihop unit was performed as of december   the date as of which the analysis has been performed in prior years 
the first step of the impairment test compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to their carrying value 
significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the discounted cash flows model include future trends in sales  operating expenses  overhead expenses  depreciation  capital expenditures and changes in working capital along with an appropriate discount rate 
additional assumptions were made as to proceeds to be received from future franchising of company operated restaurants 
based on this first step  we concluded that the fair value of the ihop unit and the applebee s franchise unit was in excess of their respective net carrying values and no impairment of goodwill was warranted 
however  the fair value of the applebee s company unit was less than the net carrying value of its assets assigned  requiring the second step of the impairment test 
in performing the second step of the impairment test we concluded that the goodwill allocated to the applebee s company unit was fully impaired and an impairment charge of million was recorded 
no tax benefit is associated with the impairment of goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of the commercial real estate market continued to weaken  the credit markets continued to be constrained  economic forecasts were uncertain as to how long the recessionary period would last  and the company s stock price declined 
the company revised the significant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flows model and updated its impairment analysis of the applebee s franchise unit 
the company determined the fair value of the applebee s franchise unit was in excess of its carrying value as of december  in addition  the company performed an impairment test of its indefinite lived intangible assets  primarily the applebee s tradename assigned in the purchase price allocation 
we utilized the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the fair value of the tradename 
we determined the fair value of the tradename as of december  was less than the carrying value 
an impairment charge of million was recorded with a tax benefit of million associated with the charge 
impairment and closure charges in included the impairment of long lived assets for three restaurants closed in  and impairment losses on two restaurants in which the reacquisition values exceeded the historical resale values 
the decision to close or impair the restaurants in was a result of a comprehensive analysis that examined restaurants not meeting minimum return on 
table of contents investment thresholds and certain other operating performance criteria 
the assets for these restaurants were written down to their estimated fair value 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was due to the inclusion of twelve months of amortization in as compared to one month in the amortization relates to intangible assets with finite lives  primarily franchising rights  recorded as part the allocation of the applebee s purchase price

in october  the company retired certain series class a ii x fixed rate term senior notes due december with a face amount of million for a cash payment of million 
the company recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately million after the write off of the discount and deferred financing costs related to the debt retired 
the loss on extinguishment of debt of million in resulted from early debt retirement with funds generated by the securitization transactions for ihop

loss on derivative financial instrument as further described under liquidity and capital resources  we entered into a swap arrangement in july we terminated the swap arrangement upon the consummation of the applebee s acquisition on november  settlement of the swap resulted in a loss related to the decline in fair value of the undesignated portion of the hedge of million for no such transaction occurred in provision for income taxes we recognized a tax benefit of million in as compared to a tax benefit of million in the change was primarily due to the decrease in our pretax book income  partially offset by impairment of non deductible goodwill 
pro forma comparison of the fiscal years ended december  and applebee s the following section illustrates certain financial results of applebee s on a stand alone basis comparing as consolidated into the company with information comprised of the month data from applebee s prior to the acquisition date of november  and the one month data of applebee s subsequent to the acquisition date pro forma 

table of contents results of operations with pro forma pro forma in millions franchise revenues company restaurant sales franchise expenses company restaurant expenses general and administrative expenses franchise operations applebee s franchise revenues in increased from million to million as compared to pro forma  primarily due to an increase in effective restaurants from  restaurants in to  restaurants in and million of revenue on temporary liquor agreements on company operated restaurants in the texas market that were franchised in october the increase in effective restaurants was mainly due to the company stores franchised during and new store openings in this increase was partially offset by a decrease in franchise domestic same store sales of in as compared to applebee s franchise expenses in increased from million to million as compared to pro forma this increase was due primarily to million of expenses related to temporary liquor agreements on the texas restaurants noted above and million increase in claims expense recognized related to the captive insurance subsidiary 
company restaurant operations applebee s company restaurant sales for the full fiscal year in decreased from pro forma  million in to  million in this decrease was due primarily to the decrease in effective restaurants of from restaurants in to restaurants in due to the franchising of company stores during and a decrease in company same store sales of in as compared to the decrease in same store sales is driven mainly by decline in guest traffic partially offset by an increase in average guest check 
the company believes that the decrease experienced in comparable guest traffic is reflective of the current economic conditions impacting consumers 
the increase in average guest check is due to menu price increases and a favorable mix shift 
applebee s company restaurant operations profit for increased by million from million in to million in the components of company restaurant expenses  as a percentage of company restaurant sales  were as follows variance pro forma food and beverage labor direct and occupancy pre opening expense total cost of company restaurant sales a a percentages may not add due to rounding 

table of contents total food and beverage costs as a percent of company restaurant sales were flat in as compared to food usage was impacted by increased commodity costs but offset by price increases and food cost improvement initiatives 
total labor costs as a percent of company restaurant sales decreased by in as compared to the decrease in was due primarily to reductions in hourly labor costs as a percentage of sales due to an increased guest check offset by higher management incentive compensation driven by a more costly bonus program in place during the first fiscal quarter of direct and occupancy costs decreased by in as compared to due primarily to favorable depreciation expense  which resulted from purchase price allocations related to applebee s acquisition and the reclassification of restaurants into assets held for sale  partially offset by an increase in rent expense and smallwares associated with purchase accounting and unfavorable utility expense 
pre opening expense decreased by in as compared to due to opening one company restaurant in early as compared to in we do not currently plan to open any domestic company operated restaurants in the foreseeable future 
rental operations as the result of several transactions related to the franchising of applebee s company operated restaurants  applebee s now has rental income 
the amount of applebee s rental income in was  offset by  in expenses 
this activity relates only to the franchising of the restaurants  applebee s is not entering into rental operations similar to those of ihop 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in the decrease was due primarily to the non recurrence of stock based compensation and severance costs incurred in connection with the applebee s acquisition as well as non recurrence of costs related to the exploration of strategic alternatives for enhancing shareholder value 
liquidity and capital resources of the company the acquisition of applebee s in november had a significant impact on the liquidity and capital resources of the company 
while the addition of applebee s increased our cash flow from operations  a significant portion of the increase was consumed by interest payments on billion of indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition 
cash paid for interest was million in and million in as compared to million in the amount of indebtedness also limits our ability to obtain additional financing  due to both explicit limitations in the indenture under which the indebtedness was issued and marketplace perception of our remaining debt capacity 
as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the fixed rate notes the notes issued as part of the applebee s and ihop november securitization transactions have a legal maturity of december  however  the indentures under which the notes were issued includes provisions which may require the early repayment  in whole or in part  of the notes which  if not met  would require the company to use all or part of the excess cash flow that would otherwise be available for general business purposes to fund a reserve account for the notes or to begin to pay down the notes see debt covenant compliance below 
as of december   the conditions that would require an early repayment date for the notes had not occurred 
irrespective of covenant compliance  the accelerated payment date for the applebee s and ihop november securitization debt is december  subject to extensions as discussed below 
in the event that we are unable to refinance the applebee s and ihop november securitization debt by december  we will have the ability to extend the scheduled payment date 
table of contents for six months if we are in compliance with applicable covenant ratios at that time 
the interest rate on this debt will increase by  and any unpaid amount will accrue interest at such increased rate 
similarly  if we are unable to refinance the ihop march securitization debt by march  we will have the ability to extend the scheduled repayment date for up to two years with a annual increase in the interest rate each year 
however  if the ihop november securitization debt goes into rapid amortization  the ihop march securitization debt will go into rapid amortization as well 
we intend to refinance all of the applebee s and ihop indebtedness prior to the expiration of such extension periods that are available 
we may also seek to renegotiate the terms applicable to the repayment of principal under the relevant securitization program  raise capital or otherwise explore alternative measures to repay the securitization debt 
in the event that we are unable to refinance the applebee s or ihop securitization debt upon the expiration of the relevant extension periods  a rapid amortization event see debt covenant compliance below will occur under the applicable securitization program and all excess cash flow after all required payments have been made will be deposited in the principal payment account for that program and used to repay principal of the applicable securitization debt 
currently  there is no specific plan to prepay any of the securitization debt prior to december however  we are constantly reviewing all available options to efficiently manage our debt portfolio in light of the general economic climate and market conditions 
in the event a significant portion of the securitization debt is repaid prior to december  we may be liable for certain make whole prepayment penalties with respect to the securitization debt and the applicable insurance policies 
the amount of any prepayment penalty with respect to the securitization debt would be determined based upon  among other things  the date of repayment  prevailing benchmark interest rates at the time of repayment and the percentage of debt repaid 
although generally speaking the amount of penalty will decline to zero in december  the decline is not necessarily linear over time due to specific provisions under the indenture under which the debt was issued and the variability of interest rates 
detailed calculations of prepayment penalties are contained in the applicable series supplements filed as exhibits and to our form q filed on may  and exhibits and to our form k filed on february  the prepayment penalty does not apply to open market repurchases of the debt 
debt covenant compliance as part of the financing for the applebee s acquisition  certain subsidiaries of the company completed two separate securitization transactions 
the securitization transactions consisted of an issuance of debt collateralized by applebee s restaurant assets the applebee s notes and a separate issuance of debt collateralized by ihop restaurant assets the ihop notes 
previously  ihop completed a million securitization in march  which is subject to the same debt covenants as ihop s november securitization 
this securitized debt is subject to a series of covenants and restrictions which are customary for transactions of this type 
as of december   approximately billion of securitized debt is subject to these covenants and restrictions 
the most significant covenants related to the securitized debt require the maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio and certain debt service coverage ratios 
the consolidated leverage ratio is defined as a the sum of i all securitized debt assuming all variable funding facilities are fully drawn  ii all other debt of the company  and iii current monthly operating lease expense multiplied 
table of contents by  divided by b the sum of i the company s ebitda as defined for the preceding months  and ii annualized operating lease expense 
maximum ratios for this test were as follows applebee s notes ihop notes through november x x through november x x thereafter x x failure to remain under these maximums could result in required early amortization of outstanding principal amounts of the applebee s notes or ihop notes 
at december   the company s consolidated leverage ratio was x 
if the ebitda component of the calculation had been million  or  lower  the company would have exceeded the maximum ratio allowed for the ihop notes 
the company s consolidated leverage ratio was x at december  the consolidated leverage ratio has never fallen below a required maximum for either the applebee s notes or the ihop notes in any period since the notes were issued 
as noted above  the denominator of the consolidated leverage ratio includes ebitda for the preceding months 
our ebitda has benefited from gains on debt extinguishment that will ultimately drop out of the calculation once they fall out of the rolling month calculation period 
to the extent gains on debt extinguishment do not continue to occur in amounts similar to those that have been recognized in the past months  our consolidated leverage ratio will be adversely impacted 
the consolidated leverage ratio calculated as of december   excluding all gains on extinguishment of debt from the rolling month calculation period  would have been x 
the formulas for calculating the debt service coverage ratios dscr for each securitization are fairly complex with numerous defined terms 
in concept  dscr is the ratio of restaurant net cash flow as defined divided by total debt service payments  which include  among other things  interest payments  insurance premiums and administrative expenses 
the minimum dscr for the preceding three months is x 
the consequences of falling below specified minimum three month dscrs vary depending upon the actual ratio achieved 
three month dscrs below x can trigger a cash trapping event  a rapid amortization event  or a default event  as outlined in the table below 
in a cash trapping event  the indenture trustee for the affected securitization is required to retain a certain percentage of cash flow after all required payments have been made in a restricted account 
no principal amounts of debt are retired in a cash trapping event 
in a rapid amortization event  all excess cash flow after all required payments have been made is retained and used to retire principal amounts of debt 
these events are triggered as follows applebee s notes ihop notes cash trapping event less than x of cash flow less than x of cash flow cash trapping event less than x of cash flow less than x of cash flow rapid amortization event less than x less than x default event less than x less than x there are also provisions for a one time cure of either a cash trapping event or a rapid amortization event if the dscr recovers to certain levels for three consecutive payment dates 
a rapid amortization event can also be triggered in other defined circumstances unrelated to the dscr  including applebee s failure to maintain a minimum level of system wide sales 
at december   the applebee s three month dscr was x and the ihop three month dscr was x 
if the restaurant cash flow components of the calculation had been million  or  and million  or  lower for purposes of the applebee s and ihop calculations  respectively  the company would have fallen below the x minimum threshold 
at december   the applebee s 
table of contents three month dscr was x and the ihop three month dscr was x 
the dscr has never fallen below x for either the applebee s notes or the ihop notes in any period since the notes were issued 
a second covenant test based on dscr becomes effective under the applebee s notes beginning with the fiscal quarter commencing january and ending with the fiscal quarter commencing october this test is based on the same dscr calculation described above but covering the preceding month period as opposed to the preceding three month period 
a month dscr below minimum set forth in the following table can trigger a partial amortization event 
in a partial amortization event  the indenture trustee for the applebee s securitization is required to retain an amount equal to the lesser of i the sum of  plus the shortfall  if any  in the retained amount from a preceding period under a partial amortization event and ii the outstanding principal amount of the applebee s notes plus the shortfall  if any  from a preceding period under a partial amortization event 
all retained amounts are used to retire principal amounts of debt in order of seniority 
the initial minimum month dscr is x and that minimum increases by basis points each quarter  as follows fiscal quarter commencing in minimum twelve month dcsr january x april x july x october x january x april x july x october x january x april x july x october x the test of applebee s month dscr set forth above is not required until the payment date occurring in january and will end with the payment date occurring in december the applebee s month dscr as of december  was x 
franchising of applebee s company operated restaurants another effect of the applebee s acquisition on our liquidity is the planned monetization of certain applebee s assets 
we are continuing to pursue a strategy which transitions from our current franchised applebee s system to an approximately franchised applebee s system  similar to ihop s franchised system 
in order to accomplish this strategy  we plan to franchise substantially all of the company operated applebee s restaurants while retaining part of the kansas city area as a company market 
this heavily franchised business model is expected to require less capital investment  improve margins and reduce the volatility of cash flow performance over time  while also providing cash proceeds from the franchising of the restaurants 
if our strategy to transition to a franchised system is delayed or sales proceeds from franchising restaurants are less than anticipated  we believe that the company operated applebee s restaurants will continue to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our obligations  such that we will not be compelled to enter into refranchising transactions at prices lower than we deem appropriate 
under the terms of the securitized debt agreements  all of the proceeds of asset dispositions must be used to retire long term debt at par 

table of contents during  we completed the franchising of seven company operated applebee s restaurants in the new mexico markets 
proceeds from asset dispositions  including the seven restaurants  totaled million for the twelve months ended december  of that amount  million was used to retire applebee s notes see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
credit facilities applebee s has a million revolving credit facility  the series class a variable funding senior notes 
ihop has a million revolving credit facility  the series variable funding notes 
at december   both revolving credit facilities had been fully drawn and the company does not presently have additional committed sources of credit 
however  we believe that our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  which totaled million as of december   and cash generated from operating activities provide adequate liquidity for the foreseeable future in the absence of additional credit facilities 
the payments up to million of the series class a variable funding senior notes and the entire issue of the series class a ii a fixed rate term senior notes issued in connection with the applebee s securitization are insured under a financial guaranty insurance policy 
if the insurance company were to become subject to insolvency or similar proceedings  an event of default would occur under the indenture pursuant to which the notes were issued  and the holders of the variable funding notes would no longer be required to fund draws on the facility 
we have no reason to question the solvency of the insurance company that insures these payments  and its senior unsecured debt obligations are highly rated at the current time 
the payments of the series variable funding senior notes and the series fixed rate notes issued in connection with the march ihop securitization are insured under a financial guaranty insurance policy 
there are concerns about the solvency of fgic and the effectiveness of the insurance policy as fgic is presently required to suspend payment on all claims in accordance with an order issued by the new york insurance department on november  while the insolvency of fgic will not cause an event of default under the indenture pursuant to which these notes were issued  it will cause fgic to cease being the controlling party with respect to the march notes and will require the ihop co issuers to obtain consent from a majority of the noteholders rather than fgic for any actions to be taken with respect to the securitization program  including amendments that require the consent of the controlling party 
our ability to pay the interest on our indebtedness  to make scheduled payments of principal and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on future performance of our operations  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based upon the current level of operations and our current expectations for future periods in light of the current economic environment  we presently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents  which totaled million as of december   together with expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  retirement of securitized debt  capital expenditures and other obligations for at least the next months 
further  based on current projections  we believe that we will remain in compliance with the debt covenants discussed above for at least the next months 
however  if we are not able to achieve forecasted revenue targets and operating improvements  this assessment would have to be reconsidered 
additionally  certain applebee s notes have accelerated payment dates in december  and we will likely seek to refinance this debt if it has not been repaid prior to then 
we may not be able to effect any future refinancing of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

table of contents cash flows in summary  our cash flows were as follows in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by revenues earned and collected from our franchisees  operating earnings from our company operated restaurants and profit from our rental operations and financing operations 
franchise revenues consist of royalties  ihop advertising fees and sales of proprietary products for ihop  each of which fluctuates with increases or decreases in franchise retail sales 
franchise retail sales are impacted by the development of ihop and applebee s restaurants by our franchisees and by fluctuations in same store sales 
operating earnings from company operated restaurants are impacted by many factors which include but are not limited to changes in traffic patterns  pricing activities and changes in operating expenses 
rental operations profit is rental income less rental expenses 
rental income includes revenues from operating leases and interest income from direct financing leases 
rental expenses are costs of prime operating leases and interest expense on prime capital leases on franchisee operated restaurants 
financing operations revenue consists of the portion of franchise fees not allocated to ihop intellectual property  sales of equipment  as well as interest income from the financing of franchise fees and equipment leases 
financing expenses are primarily the cost of restaurant equipment 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million during the months ended december  from million in the same period in  primarily due to an increase in net income of million  partially offset by a decrease of million in noncash adjustments primarily depreciation  non cash interest  impairment charges  gains on debt extinguishment and asset sales and deferred taxes 
working capital changes used cash of million during compared to a million use in the decrease in working capital used was due primarily to the faster settlement of receivables from gift card sales and lower payments for retention bonuses  partially offset by an increase in prepayments related to the january  close of the fiscal year and the timing of payments for advertising 
cash paid for interest in was million as compared to million in investing activities net cash provided by investing activities in was primarily attributable to of proceeds from dispositions of assets  primarily the franchising of seven applebee s company operated restaurants  and million of principal receipts from notes and equipment contracts receivable  partially offset by million of capital expenditures 
capital expenditures are expected to range between million and million in fiscal 
table of contents the following table represents the principal receipts on various receivables due from our franchisees as of december  principal receipts due by period thereafter total in millions equipment leases direct financing leases franchise notes and other total equipment lease receivables extend through the year direct financing lease receivables extend through the year franchise note receivables extend through the year financing activities financing activities used net cash of million during cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of million in repayments of long term debt  payment of accrued debt issuance costs of million  capital lease obligation and financing obligation repayments of million and million in dividend payments on series a preferred stock 
of the long term debt repayments  million was related to the early retirement of securitzation debt with excess cash  million was related to scheduled repayments and million related to redemptions with proceeds of asset dispositions and other items as required under the securitization agreements 
cash provided by financing activities resulted from a decrease of million in restricted cash related to the securitizations and a borrowing of million from the ihop revolving credit facility 
share repurchases and dividends in january  our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase shares of the company s common stock 
as of december   the board approved the repurchase of up to million shares of common stock 
the company has repurchased million shares of its common stock since the inception of the program at a total cost of million 
the company did not repurchase shares in in february  the board of directors cancelled the authorization to repurchase any additional shares under this program 
the company had accrued million as dividends for the series a perpetual preferred stock as of january   the close of fiscal the company s most recent quarterly dividend of per common share was paid in december effective december   the company suspended the payment of its quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders for the foreseeable future in order to maximize the financial flexibility of the company 
future dividend payments on the common shares may be resumed at the discretion of the board of directors after consideration of the company s earnings  financial condition  cash requirements  future prospects and other factors 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a of sec regulation s k 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following are our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations year years years more than years total in millions debt financing obligation operating leases capital leases purchase commitments other obligations total minimum payments less interest at december   we had a reserve for unrecognized tax benefit including potential interest and penalties  net of related tax benefit  totaling million  of which approximately million is expected to be paid within one year 
for the remaining liability  due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses in the reporting period 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangibles goodwill is recorded when the aggregate purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisition are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and are estimated by management based on the fair value of the assets received 
identifiable intangible assets are comprised primarily of trademarks  tradenames  liquor licenses  which are considered to have an indefinite life  and franchise agreements  recipes and menus  favorable lease agreements  which are considered to have a finite life 
intangible assets with finite lives are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight line method and estimated useful lives 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not subject to amortization 

table of contents goodwill has been allocated to three reporting units  the ihop franchised restaurants unit ihop unit  applebee s company operated restaurants unit applebee s company unit and applebee s franchised restaurants unit applebee s franchise unit 
the significant majority of the company s goodwill resulted from the november  acquisition of applebee s and has been allocated between the two applebee s units 
the company tests goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter 
the annual impairment test of goodwill of the two applebee s units is performed as of october of each year 
the annual impairment test of the goodwill of the ihop unit is performed as of december of each year  the date as of which the analysis has been performed in prior years 
in addition to the annual test of impairment  goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets must be evaluated more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  events or circumstances such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  adverse legal or regulatory developments  or a significant decline in the market price of the company s common stock 
in the process of the company s annual impairment review of goodwill  the company primarily uses the income approach method of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value 
significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the discounted cash flows model include future trends in sales  operating expenses  overhead expenses  depreciation  capital expenditures  and changes in working capital along with an appropriate discount rate 
additional assumptions are made as to proceeds to be received from future franchising of company operated restaurants 
step one of the impairment test compares the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value 
if the fair value is in excess of the carrying value  no impairment exists 
if the step one test does indicate an impairment  step two must take place 
under step two  the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated as if the reporting unit were acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the carrying amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill  to which the carrying value of the goodwill must be adjusted 
the fair value of all reporting units is then compared to the current market value of the company s common stock to determine if the fair values estimated in the impairment testing process are reasonable in light of the current market value 
in the process of the company s annual impairment review of the tradename  the most significant indefinite life intangible asset  the company primarily uses the relief of royalty method under income approach method of valuation 
significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the relief of royalty method include future trends in sales  a royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the forecast revenue stream 
long lived assets we assess long lived and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
we consider factors such as the number of years the restaurant has been operated by us  sales trends  cash flow trends  remaining lease life  and other factors which apply on a case by case basis 
the analysis is performed at the individual restaurant level for indicators of permanent impairment 
recoverability of the restaurant s assets is measured by comparing the assets carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated over the assets remaining useful life or remaining lease term  whichever is less 
if the total expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  the carrying amount is written down to the estimated fair value  and a loss resulting from impairment is recognized by charging to earnings 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 

table of contents if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
fair value measurements the company determines the fair market values of its financial assets and liabilities  as well as non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis  based on the fair value hierarchy established in us gaap 
we measure our financial assets and liabilities using inputs from the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy 
the three levels are as follows level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability ie  interest rates  yield curves  etc  and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means market corroborated inputs 
level includes unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
we develop these inputs based on the best information available  including our own data 
for more information on the financial instruments the company measures at fair value  see note  fair value measurements  of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase price allocation the purchase price for acquisitions is allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values as determined in accordance with us gaap 
the determination of estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets and certain tangible assets requires significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to  determining the estimated future cash flows  estimated useful lives of assets and appropriate discount rates 
we believe the estimated fair values assigned to the applebee s assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
leases our restaurants are located on i sites owned by us  ii sites leased by us from third parties and iii sites owned or leased by franchisees 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease in accordance with the provisions of us gaap governing the accounting for leases 
the lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we obtain possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
prior to january   we capitalized rent expense from possession date through construction completion and reported the related asset in property and equipment 
capitalized rent was amortized through depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated useful life of the related assets limited to the lease term 
straight line rent recorded during the preopening period construction completion through restaurant open date was recorded as expense 
commencing january   we expense rent from possession date through restaurant open date 
once a restaurant opens for business  we record straight line rent over the lease term plus contingent rent to the extent it exceeded the minimum rent obligation per the lease agreement 
we use a consistent lease term when calculating depreciation of leasehold improvements  when determining straight line rent expense and when determining classification of our leases as either operating or capital 

table of contents there is potential for variability in the rent holiday period  which begins on the possession date and ends on the restaurant open date  during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period and lesser occupancy expense during the rest of the lease term post opening 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon our possession of the premises  and record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as a lease obligation 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rent 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred  in addition to the straight line rent expense noted above 
certain of our lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances 
for purposes of recognizing incentives  we amortize the incentives over the shorter of the estimated useful life or lease term 
for tenant improvement allowances  we also record a deferred rent liability or an obligation in our non current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease  which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holiday and or escalations in payment that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with us gaap governing share based payments 
accordingly  we measure stock based compensation expense at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and recognize the expense over the employee s requisite service period using the straight line method 
the fair value of each employee stock option and restricted stock award is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based compensation 
the black scholes model meets the requirements of us gaap 
the measurement of stock based compensation expense is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors  such as expected term of the award  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and forfeiture rate 
these inputs are subjective and are determined using management s judgment 
if differences arise between the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation expense and the actual factors which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining future stock based compensation expense 
any such changes could materially impact our operations in the period in which the changes are made and in subsequent periods 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state income tax liabilities 
our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayers and respective governmental authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions 
we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

table of contents we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax accounting requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portions or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this test requires projection of our taxable income into future years to determine if there will be taxable income sufficient to realize the tax assets 
the preparation of the projections requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our income tax expense will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
tax contingency reserves result from our estimates of potential liabilities resulting from differences between actual and audited results 
we usually file our income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretation of the tax laws 
changes in the tax contingency reserves result from resolution of audits of prior year filings  the expiration of the statute of limitations  changes in tax laws and current year estimates for asserted and unasserted items 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law  both legislated and concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
significant changes in our estimates could materially affect our reported results 
under us gaap addressing the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is not longer met 
we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various tax jurisdictions 
the application is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
insurance reserves we use estimates in the determination of the appropriate liabilities for general liability  workers compensation and health insurance 
the estimated liability is established based upon historical claims data and third party actuarial estimates of settlement costs for incurred claims 
unanticipated changes in these factors may require us to revise our estimates 
we periodically reassess our assumptions and judgments and make adjustments when significant facts and circumstances dictate 
a change in any of the above estimates could impact our consolidated statements of earnings  and the related asset or liability recorded in our consolidated balance sheets would be adjusted accordingly 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates that are described above 
derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business we utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
we account for our derivative instruments under us gaap that requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of the hedging relationships 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates 
all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
for derivative 
table of contents instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge ie  hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings for example  in interest expense when the hedged transactions are interest cash flows associated with debt 
the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item  if any  is recognized in other income expense in current earnings during the period of change 
at inception of the hedge  we choose the hypothetical derivative method of effectiveness calculation  which we must use for the life of the contract and we will measure effectiveness quarterly 
if the transaction qualifies for hedge treatment  the changes in fair values related to the effective portion of the derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income or loss or in income expense  depending on the designation of the derivative as a cash flow hedge 
we obtain the values on a quarterly basis from the counterparty of the derivative contracts 
the undesignated portion of the derivative contract is calculated and recorded in the company s consolidated statements of operations at the end of each quarter until settled 
presently we have no active derivative financial instruments 
recently adopted accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board the fasb amended us gaap with respect to fair value measurements 
these amendments  among other things  defined fair value  established a framework for measuring fair value and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb delayed for one year the applicability of the amended fair value measurement requirements to certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
the company adopted the requirements that had been deferred on january  the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb amended us gaap with respect to business combinations 
these amendments  among other things  established principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
these amendments also established disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted the amended requirements for business combinations on january  and will apply the requirements prospectively 
in march  the fasb amended us gaap with respect to derivative instruments and hedging activities 
these amendments  among other things  require companies to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why they use derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
the company adopted the new disclosure requirements on january  as the amendments did not change current accounting practice  there was no impact of the adoption on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in april  the fasb amended us gaap with respect to the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the intent of the amendments is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under previously existing us gaap related to goodwill and other intangible assets and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under us gaap with respect to business combinations 
the company adopted the amended 
table of contents requirements on january   and will apply the provisions prospectively to any intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
in june  the fasb amended us gaap with respect to determining if an instrument granted in a share based payment transaction is a participating security 
these amendments  among other things  require unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to receive non forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents to be included in the two class method of computing earnings per share 
the company retroactively adopted these amendments on january  the impact of the adoption on earnings per share as previously reported for the years ended december  and was not material 
in april  the fasb amended us gaap to address concerns regarding a determining whether a market is not active and a transaction is not orderly  b recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments and c interim disclosures of fair values of financial instruments 
the company adopted these amendments effective april  there was no impact of the adoption on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb amended us gaap with respect to subsequent events 
these amendments  among other things  established general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the company adopted these amendments effective april  the fasb modified its guidance in february and the company adopted the modification for its december financial reporting 
there was no impact of the adoption or the modification on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb established the fasb accounting standards codification the codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative us gaap for sec registrants 
all guidance contained in the codification carries an equal level of authority 
the codification became effective for the company in the third fiscal quarter of adoption of the codification did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in august  the fasb amended us gaap with respect to measuring liabilities at fair value 
these amendments provide clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value of such liability using one or more of the techniques prescribed by the update 
adoption of these amendments in the fourth quarter of fiscal year did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb amended us gaap with respect to the accounting for transfers of financial assets 
these amendments  among other things  clarified that the objective of us gaap is to determine whether a transferor and all of the entities included in the transferor s financial statements being presented have surrendered control over transferred financial assets  limited the circumstances in which a financial asset  or portion of a financial asset  should be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire original financial asset to an entity that is not consolidated with the transferor in the financial statements being presented and or when the transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred financial asset  and removed the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity 
the company will be required to adopt these amendments effective january   and is currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  on its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb amended us gaap with respect to the consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
these amendments  among other things  i change existing guidance for determining whether an entity is a vie  ii require ongoing reassessments of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a vie  and iii require enhanced disclosures about an entity s involvement in a vie 
the company will be required to adopt these amendments effective january  adoption of these amendments will not result in the identification of additional vies 
for the vie the company has currently identified see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  adoption will not change the determination that the company is not the primary beneficiary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk  including interest rates and commodity prices 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that may include the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense is more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in the us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments  and interest expense on our variable funding notes 
our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
investments in fixed interest rate earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
we currently do not hold any fixed rate investments 
as of december  our long term investments are comprised primarily of certificates of deposits  mutual funds invested in auction rate securities and one auction rate security  these investments are included in restricted assets related to the captive insurance subsidiary 
we have classified these investments as available for sale 
due to the short time period between reset dates of the interest rates  there are no unrealized gains or losses associated with interest rate related to the auction rate securities 
the one auction rate security has a contractual maturity of december based on our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and long term investment holdings as of december   a increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest income by approximately million 
a decline in interest rates would decrease our annual interest income by less than million as the majority of our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and long term investment holdings are currently yielding less than 
on july   we entered into an interest rate swap contract the swap as a condition of the acquisition financing with lehman brothers special financial inc lbsfi  guaranteed by lehman brothers holdings  inc lbhi 
the swap was intended to hedge our interest payments on the asset backed notes that were issued in november to finance the applebee s acquisition 
the swap sets forth the terms of a five year interest rate swap in which we would be the fixed rate payer and lbsfi would be the floating rate payer the reference swap 
the reference swap has an effective date of july   a notional amount of billion  a floating rate of libor and a fixed rate of 
on november   we terminated the swap upon the consummation of the applebee s acquisition 
the fair value of the swap was million 
the fair value of the designated portion of the swap amounted to million million net of tax effect and is included as accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of the undesignated portion of the swap resulted in additional interest expense of million for the year ended december   which was included in our consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents at december   we had million of variable rate debt 
if the interest on our variable rate debt were to increase or decrease by for the year  annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately million based on the amount of outstanding variable rate debt at december  commodity prices many of the food products purchased by us and our franchisees and area licensees are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to unpredictable price volatility 
extreme changes in commodity prices and or long term changes could affect our franchisees  area licensees and company operated restaurants adversely 
we expect that  in most cases  the ihop and applebee s systems would be able to pass increased commodity prices through to our consumers via increases in menu prices 
from time to time  competitive circumstances could limit short term menu price flexibility  and in those cases  margins would be negatively impacted by increased commodity prices 
we believe that any changes in commodity pricing that cannot be adjusted for by changes in menu pricing or other strategies would not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the company and owners of applebee s and ihop franchise restaurants formed centralized supply chain services  llc cscs or the co op to manage procurement activities for the applebee s and ihop restaurants choosing to join the co op 
we believe the larger scale created by combining the supply chain requirements of both brands under one organization can provide cost savings and efficiency in the purchasing function 
as of december   of applebee s franchise restaurants and over of ihop franchise restaurants are members of cscs 
while the majority of the food products utilized by ihop and applebee s systems are sourced through cscs  in some instances  we enter into commitments to purchase food and other items on behalf of the ihop and applebee s systems 
none of these food product contracts or agreements is a derivative instrument 
at december   our outstanding purchase commitments for food products were less than million
