item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview depomed is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of differentiated products that address large and growing markets and are based on proprietary oral drug delivery technologies 
in  we completed phase clinical trials for two product candidates 
in october  we announced that dm  an extended release formulation of gabapentin for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia that we have licensed to abbott laboratories subsidiary  solvay pharmaceuticals  inc solvay met its phase clinical trial primary endpoint with statistical significance 
we expect a new drug application nda for dm to be filed with the fda in march also in october  we announced the results of breeze and breeze  our phase clinical trials for serada  our proprietary extended release formulation of gabapentin for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes 
the higher dose formulation of serada evaluated in the studies met five of eight co primary endpoints across the two studies  while the lower dose formulation evaluated met four of eight co primary endpoints 
in december  we met with the fda to discuss the results of the breeze and breeze studies and any additional clinical development that may be required to obtain approval to market serada in the united states 
based on guidance from the meeting with the fda  we expect to initiate one additional phase trial for serada by the end of april we seek to optimize the use and value of our product candidates and drug delivery technologies in three ways 
first  we are seeking to assemble a number of pharmaceutical products that can be highly differentiated from immediate release versions of the compounds upon which they are based and may be promoted together within a specialty pharmaceutical field  such as women s health care providers 
our development of serada  and our retention of co promotion rights within the obstetrics gynecology field in our commercialization arrangements with covidien  ltd 
covidien and santarus  inc santarus  are examples of this aspect of our business strategy 
second  we out license product candidates after we have increased their value through our formulation and clinical development efforts 
our dm license and development arrangement with solvay is an example of this strategy 
third  we enter into collaborative partnerships with other companies where the unique capabilities of our technology can provide superior value to a partner s product candidate  resulting in greater value for depomed than traditional fee for service arrangements 
our license and development arrangement with covidien and our license agreement with merck co  inc merck are examples of this strategy 
we have developed two products which have been approved by the fda and are currently marketed 
glumetza is a once daily treatment for adults with type diabetes that we commercialize in the united states with santarus 
proquin xr ciprofloxacin hydrochloride is a once daily treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections 
critical accounting policies and estimates a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to financial statements  and the impact and risks associated with our accounting policies are discussed throughout this annual report on form k and in the footnotes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgment and or estimates by management at the time that financial statements are prepared such that materially different results might have been reported if other assumptions had been made 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  accrued liabilities  stock based compensation and use of estimates to be critical policies 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other 
table of contents assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of glumetza and proquin xr products  and from license fees  milestones and royalties earned on license agreements and collaborative arrangements 
revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title has passed  the price is fixed or determinable and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
product sales we sell glumetza product to wholesalers and retail pharmacies that is subject to rights of return within a period beginning six months prior to  and ending twelve months following product expiration 
we began shipping glumetza product to customers in the third quarter of we currently recognize revenue on shipments of glumetza product at the time title transfers to our customers  which occurs at the time our product is shipped to the customer 
prior to the third quarter of  we were unable to reasonably estimate expected returns of the product at the time of shipment  and therefore  deferred revenue on product shipments of glumetza until the product was dispensed through patient prescriptions 
the quantity of prescription units dispensed was estimated based on analysis of third party information  including third party market research data and information obtained from wholesalers with respect to inventory levels and inventory movement 
based on the shipment trends  prescription trends and product returns history for glumetza over two years through the third quarter of and based on an analysis of return rates of companies with products that have similar characteristics and similar return policies within the metformin prescription market  we concluded that we had the information needed to reasonably estimate product returns during the third quarter of beginning in the third quarter of  we began recognizing revenue for glumetza sales as revenue at the time of shipment to our customers 
consequently  in  we recognized a one time increase of million in net product sales of glumetza  representing product sales previously deferred  net of estimated product returns  managed care and medicaid rebates  wholesaler and retail pharmacy fees and discounts  chargebacks and prompt payment discounts 
deferred costs related to shipments of glumetza previously deferred were also recognized to cost of sales 
this change resulted in a one time million reduction of net loss for revenues from glumetza product sales are recorded net of estimated product returns  managed care rebates  wholesaler and retail pharmacy fees and discounts  prompt payment discounts  patient support programs  chargebacks  and medicaid rebates 
these gross to net sales adjustments are recognized in the same period the related revenue is recognized and are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
we obtained the rights back from esprit pharma esprit to market proquin xr product in july  and began selling proquin xr to wholesalers and retail pharmacies in october given our limited history of selling proquin xr and declining prescription demand of proquin xr  we currently cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the product at the time of shipment 
accordingly  we defer recognition of revenue on product shipments of proquin xr until the right of return no longer exists  
table of contents which occurs at the earlier of the time proquin xr units are dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return 
we estimate patient prescriptions dispensed using an analysis of third party information  including third party market research data and information obtained from wholesalers with respect to inventory levels and inventory movement 
we have not had significant history estimating the number of patient prescriptions dispensed for proquin xr 
if we underestimate or overestimate patient prescriptions dispensed for a given period  adjustments to revenue may be necessary in future periods 
we have a deferred revenue balance of million at december  related to proquin xr product shipments that have not been recognized as revenue  which is net of wholesaler and retail pharmacy fees and discounts and prompt payment discounts 
we will recognize revenue for proquin xr upon the earlier of prescription units dispensed or expiration of the right of return until we can reliably estimate product returns  at which time we will record a one time increase in net revenue related to the recognition of revenue previously deferred 
in addition  the costs of manufacturing proquin xr associated with the deferred revenue are recorded as deferred costs  which are included in inventory  until such time the deferred revenue is recognized 
revenues from proquin xr product sales are recorded net of estimated wholesaler and retail pharmacy fees and discounts  prompt payment discounts  chargebacks and medicaid rebates 
these gross to net sales adjustments are recognized in the same period the related revenue is recognized and are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
product sales allowances we recognize product sales allowances as a reduction of product sales in the same period the related revenue is recognized 
product sales allowances are based on amounts owed or to be claimed on the related sales 
these estimates take into consideration the terms of our agreements with customers  historical product returns  rebates or discounts taken  estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel  the shelf life of the product  and specific known market events  such as competitive pricing and new product introductions 
if actual future results vary from the our estimates  we may need to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on product sales and earnings in the period of adjustment 
our product sales allowances include product returns we allow customers to return product for credit on returned product that is within six months before and up to one year after its product expiration date managed care rebates we offer discounts under contracts with certain managed care providers who do not purchase directly from us 
we generally pay managed care rebates one to two months after the quarter in which prescriptions subject to the rebate are filled 
wholesaler and retail pharmacy discounts we offer contractually determined discounts to certain wholesale distributors and retail pharmacies that purchase directly from us 
these discounts are either taken off invoice at the time of shipment or paid to the customer on a quarterly basis one to two months after the quarter in which product was shipped to the customer 
prompt pay discounts we offer cash discounts to our customers  generally of the sales price  as an incentive for prompt payment 
based on our experience  the company expects its customers to comply with the payment terms to earn the cash discount 
medicaid rebates we participate in medicaid rebate programs  which provide assistance to certain low income patients based on each individual state s guidelines regarding eligibility and services 
under the medicaid rebate programs  we pay a rebate to each participating state  generally two to three months after the quarter in which prescriptions subject to the rebate are filled 

table of contents chargebacks we provide discounts to authorized users of the federal supply schedule fss of the general services administration under an fss contract with the department of veterans affairs 
these federal entities purchase products from the wholesale distributors at a discounted price  and the wholesale distributors then charge back to us the difference between the current retail price and the price the federal entity paid for the product 
patient discount programs we offer loyalty card programs for glumetza in which patients receive certain discounts off their prescription at participating retail pharmacies 
the discounts are reimbursed by the company approximately one to two months after the prescription subject to the discount is filled 
we believe our estimates related to gross to net sales adjustments for wholesaler and retail pharmacy fees and discounts  prompt payment discounts  patient support programs and chargebacks do not have a high degree of estimation complexity or uncertainty as the related amounts are settled within a relatively short period of time 
we believe that our estimated product return allowances and estimated managed care rebates for glumetza require a high degree of judgment and are subject to change based on our experience and certain quantitative and qualitative factors 
beginning in the third quarter of  we began recognizing glumetza product sales at time title transfers to our customer  and provide for an estimate of future product returns at that time 
we monitor actual return history on an individual product lot basis since product launch  which provides us with a basis to reasonably estimate future product returns  taking into consideration the shelf life of product  shipment and prescription trends  estimated distribution channel inventory levels  the return rates of companies with products that have similar characteristics and similar return policies within the metformin prescription market  as well as consideration of the introduction of competitive products 
the shelf life of the mg glumetza is currently months from the date of tablet manufacture 
on product launch in august and through the second quarter of  the shelf life of mg glumetza product shipped was months from the date of tablet manufacture 
since product launch in june and through december   the mg glumetza shelf life on product shipped to customers was months from the date of tablet manufacture 
in  based on our review of actual product returns through the end of  we increased our estimate for glumetza product returns 
this resulted in a decrease of product sales in of approximately million in related to sales made in prior periods 
because of the shelf lives of the glumetza product and our return policy of issuing credits on returned product that is within six months before and up to one year after its product expiration date  there may be a significant period of time between when the product is shipped and when we issue credits on returned product 
accordingly  we may have to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on product sales and earnings in the period of adjustments 
a increase or decrease in our returns reserve estimate for the year ended december  would have a cumulative financial statement impact of million 
our rebate accruals for glumetza are based on definitive contractual agreements with managed care providers related to the dispensing of glumetza under their respective medical benefit plans 
rebates are accrued at the time of sale  and typically are paid out several months after the sale 
we estimate rebates based on current and anticipated future patient usage  the applicable contractual rebate rate amounts  and our estimates of the quantity of product in the distribution channel 
our product sales allowances and related accruals are evaluated each reporting period and adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
such changes in estimate could materially affect our results of operations of financial position 

table of contents a rollforward of our product sales allowances for the three years ended december   is as follows in thousands contract sales discounts product returns cash discounts total balance at december  revenue allowances provision related to current period sales recorded to balance sheet payments and credits related to sales made in current period payments and credits related to sales made in prior periods balance at december  revenue allowances provision related to current period sales recorded to balance sheet payments and credits related to sales made in current period payments and credits related to sales made in prior periods balance at december  revenue allowances provision related to current period sales provision related to sales made in prior years recorded to balance sheet payments and credits related to sales made in current period payments and credits related to sales made in prior periods balance at december  includes wholesaler fees and retail discounts  launch discounts  patient support programs  managed care rebates  medicaid rebates  and chargebacks 
beginning in the third quarter of  we began recognizing glumetza product sales at the time title transfers to our customer  and began providing for an estimate of future product returns at that time 
through december   the company was unable to reasonably estimate expected returns of product at the time of shipment of proquin xr product 
accordingly  the company currently defers recognition of revenue on product shipments of proquin xr  and deferred recognition of revenue prior to the third quarter of on product shipments of glumetza  until the earlier of when units were dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return 
product sales allowances related to revenue that has been deferred are recorded on the balance sheet as a reduction of the related deferred revenue  and recognized within the income statement as a reduction of product sales in the same period the related revenue is recognized 
adjustment represents an increase in estimate of future product returns 

table of contents license and collaborative arrangements revenue from license and collaborative arrangements  including license fees creditable against future royalty obligations if any  of the licensee  is recognized when an arrangement is entered into if we have substantially completed our obligations under the terms of the arrangement and our remaining involvement is inconsequential and perfunctory 
if we have significant continuing involvement under such an arrangement  license fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated performance period 
license fee and collaborative payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
we recognize milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones if the milestone is substantive in nature  and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and the fees are nonrefundable 
milestone payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
research and development expense and accruals research and development expenses include related salaries  clinical trial costs  consultant fees and allocations of corporate costs 
all such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
these expenses result from our independent research and development efforts as well as efforts associated with collaborations 
our expense accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received from clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
if possible  we obtain information regarding unbilled services directly from service providers 
however  we may be required to estimate these services based on information available to our product development or administrative staff 
if we underestimate or overestimate the activity associated with a study or service at a given point in time  adjustments to research and development expenses may be necessary in future periods 
historically  our estimated accrued liabilities have approximated actual expense incurred 
stock based compensation we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan espp shares 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
for our volatility assumption  we use the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected term of the options 
as our historical share option exercise experience did not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term  we estimated the expected term of options granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option  as illustrated by the simplified method  and we used the simplified method to estimate the expected term for fiscal years and however  we elected to no longer utilize the simplified method after december  at january   we concluded again that our historical share option exercise experience did not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term because of limited exercise history 
for options granted after january   we have estimated the expected term by using the weighted average of a peer group of companies that grant options with similar vesting provisions 
the expected terms used for options granted in and are years and years respectively 
as required  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods 
employee and director stock based compensation costs are to be recognized over the vesting period of the award  and we have elected to use the straight line attribution method 
forfeitures are to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimated forfeitures based on historical experience 

table of contents fair value measurements effective january   the company adopted the provisions of the fair value measurements topic of the codification  which defines fair value and provides guidance for using fair value to measure certain assets and liabilities 
this topic applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
accordingly  the carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments  including cash equivalents and investments  continue to be valued at fair value on a recurring basis 
this also requires expanded disclosure of the effect on earnings for items measured using unobservable data  establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value and requires separate disclosure by level within the fair value hierarchy 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we utilize market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities  including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated or generally unobservable 
we apply the market approach valuation technique for fair value measurements and maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued using quoted prices in active markets and are valued at level or level within the fair value hierarchy

this resulted in a one time increase for the year ended december   of million in net product sales of glumetza  representing product sales previously deferred  net of estimated product returns  managed care and medicaid rebates  wholesaler and retail pharmacy fees and discounts  chargebacks and prompt payment discounts 
the additional increases in over included increased penetration in the metformin prescription market and price increases in since october  glumetza has been promoted by santarus 
from february through september  we promoted glumetza through a contract sales organization 
in october  we terminated our promotion agreement related to glumetza with king pharmaceuticals  who promoted glumetza since its launch in august  and king s promotion obligations ended in december product sales for glumetza relative to its current runrate will depend in part on the success of our promotion partner  santarus  as well any price adjustments 
proquin xr in october  we re launched proquin xr with watson  and began selling to wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
we defer recognition of revenue on product shipments of proquin xr until the right of return no longer exists  which occurs at the earlier of the time proquin xr units are dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return 
at december   we have a deferred revenue balance  which is classified as a liability on the balance sheet  of million associated with the deferral of revenue on proquin xr product shipments  which is net of estimated wholesaler fees  retail pharmacy discounts and prompt payment discounts 
the increase in proquin xr product sales in as compared to is primarily due to a longer period of time of promotion by watson  which began promotion in october in february  we amended our promotion agreement with watson  pursuant to which watson performed a specified number of details in the first quarter of the agreement with watson terminated effective december   and we currently have no sales force or promotion partner promoting proquin xr to physicians 
accordingly  we expect product sales for proquin xr relative to its current runrate to decrease as a result of a decrease in promotional efforts 
we are seeking to divest proquin xr in the united states 
royalties glumetza glumetza royalties relate to royalties we received from biovail based on net sales of glumetza in canada and royalties we received from lg based on net sales of lg s version of 
table of contents glumetza  novamet gr  in korea 
we began receiving royalties from biovail in the first quarter of and from lg in the first quarter of teva in april  we entered into a settlement and license agreement with teva related to the patent infringement lawsuit against teva affiliates ivax corporation and ivax pharmaceuticals  inc we initiated in january related to teva s generic glucophage xr tablets 
in connection with the settlement and license agreement we were entitled to receive up to a total of million in future royalties on teva s generic glucophage xr product in the united states 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in royalty revenue related to this arrangement 
as of december   a cumulative total of million in royalties has been recognized to date  with no royalties remaining under the aggregate cap 
proquin xr our agreements with esprit provided for royalty payments by esprit to us of percent to percent of proquin xr net sales in the united states  based on escalating net sales and subject to certain minimum royalty amounts 
esprit s minimum royalty amount for was million and under our amended license agreement entered into in july  amounts paid by esprit for royalties were creditable against the minimum royalty obligation 
net sales of proquin xr by esprit for and did not reach levels that would obligate esprit to pay an amount greater than the minimum royalty obligation  and accordingly  esprit paid us million in total royalties for and in july  we terminated our license agreement with esprit  and esprit paid us million in royalties  representing a pro rated amount of minimum royalties that would have been due to us under the original agreements 
esprit has no further obligations to pay us royalties on proquin xr sales 
license and collaborative revenue glumetza glumetza license revenue for the year ended december  consisted primarily of license revenue recognized from the million license fee received from biovail in july and from the million upfront fee received from santarus in july we are recognizing the million license fee payment from biovail as revenue ratably until october  which represents the estimated length of time our obligations exist under the arrangement related to royalties we are obligated to pay biovail on net sales of glumetza in the united states and for our obligation to use biovail as our sole supplier of the mg glumetza 
we are recognizing the million upfront payment from santarus as revenue ratably until october  which represents the estimated length of time our obligations exist under the arrangement related to promotion fees we are obligated to pay santarus for glumetza in the united states 
we received a million upfront license fee from lg in august and a million milestone payment in november with respect to lg s approval to market lg s extended release metformin product that incorporates our acuform technology  novamet gr  in the republic of korea 
these payments were originally deferred and amortized as license revenue over the estimated length of time we were obligated to provide assistance in development and manufacturing 
in january  we amended our agreement with lg  granted lg a license to certain of the company s intellectual property rights to manufacture the mg novamet gr in exchange for royalties on net sales of novamet gr in korea  and removed the provisions of the original agreement providing for the supply of mg novamet gr tablets by us to lg 
under the amended agreement  we no longer have continuing performance obligations to lg  and recognized the remaining million of previously 
table of contents deferred license revenue in the first quarter of as a result of this one time recognition in  glumetza license revenue decreased in as compared to proquin xr our license agreement with esprit for proquin xr provided for million in license fees from esprit 
we received million in license fees in july and an additional million in december the final million installment was paid in july the first million in license fees received were recognized as revenue ratably commencing on our receipt of the fees through june  which represented the length of time we were obligated to manufacture proquin xr under our proquin xr supply agreement with esprit 
in july  we and esprit terminated the license and supply agreements  and all deferred revenue related to license fees previously received from esprit was fully recognized as revenue in july  resulting in total recognition of million of license revenue related to our agreements with esprit in the third quarter of acuform technology in november  we entered into a license agreement with covidien granting covidien worldwide rights to utilize our acuform technology for the exclusive development of four products containing acetaminophen in combination with opiates 
in  covidien paid us a total of million in upfront fees  representing a million upfront license fee and a million upfront payment for formulation work to be performed by depomed under the agreement 
the entire million is being accounted for as a single unit of accounting and being amortized ratably through november  which is the length of time depomed is obligated to perform formulation work under the agreement 
in october  the first formulation was completed by us and delivered to covidien  which triggered a million milestone payment from covidien to us in october in february  we received million from biovail upon entering into a license and development agreement with biovail granting biovail an option to license our acuform drug delivery technology to develop and commercialize up to two pharmaceutical products 
we had no continuing performance obligations under the agreement and recognized the entire upfront license fee as revenue in the first quarter of dm dm license revenue for the three year ended december  relates to the million upfront payment received from solvay under our license agreement granting solvay exclusive rights to develop and commercialize dm in the united states  canada and mexico for pain indications

cost of sales cost of sales consists of costs of the active pharmaceutical ingredient  contract manufacturing and packaging costs  inventory write downs  product quality testing  internal employee costs related to the manufacturing process  distribution costs and shipping costs related to our product sales of glumetza and proquin xr 
total costs of sales are summarized in the following table in thousands cost of sales cost of sales decreased in compared to primarily as a result of recognition of a million provision for slow moving proquin xr inventory in based on proquin xr inventory levels and expiration dates held by the company in excess of the company s expectations on future prescription demand 
cost of sales increased in over primarily as a result of an increase in glumetza product sales 
as noted above under critical accounting policies revenue recognition  beginning in the third quarter of  we began to recognize glumetza product sales at time title transfers to our customer 
this resulted in a one time increase of approximately million in cost of sales in the costs of manufacturing associated with deferred revenue on proquin xr product shipments are recorded as deferred costs  which are included in inventory  until such time the deferred revenue is recognized 
research and development expense our research and development expenses currently include costs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  outsourced clinical and other research activities  consultants  depreciation  facilities and utilities 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses cannot be predicted at this time for our product candidates in the early phases of research and development  as it is not possible to determine the nature  timing and extent of clinical trials and studies  the fda s requirements for a particular drug and the requirements and level of participation  if any  by potential partners 
as potential products proceed through the development process  each step is typically more extensive  and therefore more expensive  than the previous step 
success in development therefore  generally results in increasing expenditures until actual product launch 
total research and development expense for the each of the three years ended december  were as follows in thousands research and development expense dollar change from prior year percentage change from prior year from through  the majority of our research and development expense was related to dm and serada programs 
in september we started our two phase clinical trials for serada for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes 
in february  we completed enrollment of our breeze phase clinical trial for serada 
in march  we completed enrollment of our breeze phase clinical trial for serada 
the treatment duration of the breeze study was six months  and the 
table of contents treatment duration of the breeze study was three months 
the trials were completed in october in march  we initiated dosing of the first patient in a phase clinical trial for dm for post herpetic neuralgia 
the treatment duration was ten weeks 
in june  we completed enrollment of our clinical trial for dm and the trial was completed in october the increase in research and development expense in from was primarily due to increased clinical research organization expenses related to the completion of our breeze and breeze phase clinical trials for serada 
the increase in research and development expense in from was primarily due to higher clinical research organization expenses with the commencement of breeze and breeze phase clinical trials for serada and commencement of our phase clinical trial for dm for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia 
we plan to conduct a single additional pivotal phase trial evaluating serada for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes 
the company expects to initiate the trial  which will be known as breeze  by the end of april and to complete the trial by the end of the first quarter of while we expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses resulting from the progress of breeze  we expect total research and development expenses to decrease in from as a result of completion of the dm phase clinical trial during we categorize our research and development expense by project

dm parkinson s disease phase study complete 
second phase study expected in we expect that the pharmaceutical products that we develop internally will take  on average  from four to eight years to research  develop and obtain fda approval in the united states  assuming that we are successful 
we generally must conduct preclinical testing on laboratory animals of new pharmaceutical products prior to commencement of clinical studies involving human beings 
these studies evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product 
we then submit the results of these studies to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application  or ind  which  if successful  allows the opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
typically  human clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase process in phase  we conduct clinical trials with a small number of subjects to determine a drug s early safety profile and its blood concentration profile over time 
a phase trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase  we conduct limited clinical trials with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and further evidence of safety 
a phase trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase  we conduct large scale  multi center  comparative trials with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety  as required by the fda 
a phase trial for our average potential product may take to years to plan and complete 
the most significant expenses associated with clinical development derive from phase trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
the successful development of pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical testing 
the fda may  at its discretion  re evaluate  alter  suspend or terminate testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the fda s assessment of the risk benefit ratio to patients 
the fda may also require additional clinical trials after 
table of contents approval  which are known as phase trials 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage and record keeping for each product 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulation  require the expenditure of substantial resources

the original conversion price of the series a preferred stock was  however  as a result of the company s march and october financings  the conversion price had been adjusted to per share 
in december  the company entered into an agreement with the series a preferred shareholder to resolve a misunderstanding between the company and the shareholder relating primarily to prior adjustments to the conversion price of the series a preferred stock 
pursuant to the agreement  among other matters  the company agreed to adjust the conversion price to per share

the fair value of the underlying common stock on december  was per share

we may be unable to raise such additional capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional capital by selling our equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our shareholders equity positions 
if adequate funds are not available we may have to delay  postpone or terminate clinical trials  significantly curtail commercialization of our marketed products or other operations  and or obtain funds through entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms

recently issued accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 measuring liabilities at fair value asu 
asu amends accounting standards codification topic  fair value measurements 
specifically  asu provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the following methods a valuation technique that uses a the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or b quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets and or a valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of topic of the accounting standards codification 
asu also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to adjust to include inputs relating to the existence of transfer restrictions on that liability 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 

table of contents in september  the fasb emerging issues task force  or eitf reached a consensus on asc update topic  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asc update asc update applies to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements that are currently within the scope of the revenue recognition multiple element arrangements topic of the codification 
asc update provides principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated 
asc update requires an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price 
asc update eliminates the use of the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method and also significantly expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asc update should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier application permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of asc update on the company s financial position or results of operations for future collaborations arrangements
