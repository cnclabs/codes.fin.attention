reclassifications certain amounts in our and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue and cost structure our broadband segment contributes the majority of our consolidated operating revenues as telecom revenues continue to decline as a result of technology changes and competitive challenges within the communications industry 
the sources of our revenues and cost structure are also impacted by changes in the legislative and regulatory environment  which  in recent years  has provided us with growth opportunities within our broadband segment

the decline in access revenues was partially offset by an increase in interstate cl settlements received from the national exchange carrier association neca of approximately  during the year ended december  as a result of a shift in revenue recovery from end users to the neca pool 
the increase in the interstate cl settlements includes a change in estimate to the neca cl accounts receivable balance which resulted in a decrease to access revenue of during the year ended december  see the regulatory matters section below for a more detailed discussion regarding surewest telephone s regulated revenues 
telecom segment operating expenses total operating expenses for the telecom segment decreased  in compared to as discussed in the residential revenue section above  during we have experienced a decline in voice rgus due in part to subscribers opting to initiate voip digital phone service offered by our broadband segment

the decrease in operating expenses in was offset in part by an increase in 
table of contents costs related to our pension plan of approximately  as described in the consolidated overview section above

the fcc establishes rules that carriers must follow in the preparation of the annual studies 

table of contents additionally  under current fcc rules governing rate making  surewest telephone is required to establish interstate rates based on projected demand usage for its various services and determine the actual earnings from these rates once actual volumes and costs are known 
as a result of periodic cost separation studies required by the fcc  surewest telephone changed its estimates for certain neca cl accounts receivable balances related to the prior year monitoring periods during the year ended december  these changes in estimates decreased our consolidated revenues and income from continuing operations by and net income by per share 
we did not record any significant changes in estimates related to prior year monitoring periods during or california public utilities commission cpuc matters in  we entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement  which was ultimately approved by the cpuc  to resolve an ongoing regulatory proceeding with various parties 
the settlement agreement resolved past sharing liabilities and suspended future sharing requirements in the intrastate jurisdiction 
in accordance with the settlement agreement  surewest telephone returned approximately  plus interest at the day commercial paper rate for non financial institutions and an imputed rate of  to its end users through a consumer dividend 
the surcredit was recorded as a reduction of our contractual shareable earnings obligations over a period of approximately four years  which began january  during the first quarter of and prior to the cessation of the surcredit on february   we returned approximately as part of the settlement agreement  surewest telephone was required to implement an additional annual consumer dividend of  on january  to end users receiving surewest telephone services subject to sharing on or after that date 
in december  the cpuc authorized us to offset our annual  interim draw from the chcf with the aforementioned  consumer dividend settlement agreement 
the chcf was previously authorized by the cpuc to offset surewest telephone s intrastate regulated operating expenses on an interim basis 
in september  the cpuc issued decision which provides for surewest telephone to phase down our annual chcf interim draw over a five year period 
in  our interim chcf draw was  and is being incrementally reduced by  annually 
we anticipate our interim chcf draw will be  in an ongoing proceeding relating to the new regulatory framework under which surewest telephone has been regulated since  the cpuc adopted decision in  which grants carriers broader pricing freedom in the provision of telecommunications services  bundling of services  promotions and customer contracts 
this decision adopted a new regulatory framework  the uniform regulatory framework urf  which among other things i eliminates price regulation and allows full pricing flexibility for all new and retail services except basic residential services  which can only be raised up to per year during and as described below  ii allows new forms of bundles and promotional packages of telecommunication services  iii allocates all gains and losses from the sale of assets to shareholders and iv eliminates almost all elements of rate of return regulation  including the calculation of shareable earnings 
on september   the cpuc adopted decision  which allows urf incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs to increase their basic residential rate by up to per year over the next two years 
beginning january   the urf ilecs will be allowed full pricing flexibility for the basic residential rate 
in december  the cpuc issued a final decision fd in a proceeding investigating the continued need for an intrastate access element called the transport interconnection charge tic 
in september  the cpuc issued a fd in its chcf b proceeding 
when taken together with the december fd  it caps surewest telephone s intrastate access charges at current levels through and eliminates the tic effective january  surewest telephone will have an opportunity to recover all or part of 
table of contents our lost tic revenue elsewhere  including residential rate adjustments subsequent to the expiration on january  of the current residential price freeze  as discussed above

non operating items other income and expense  net consolidated investment income decreased in compared to during the prior year period  we had higher cash and investment balances due primarily to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of certain non core assets  including our wireless business 
the higher cash and investment balances in the prior year periods resulted in a decrease in investment income in the current year periods

liquidity and capital resources overview we generate significant cash flows from operating activities 
the proceeds from monetizing our non strategic investments have also provided us with a significant source of cash flow

the covenants also require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum levels of tangible net worth 
if we fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions  such as making timely interest or principal payments  it could lead to an event of default and the acceleration of our obligations under those agreements 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants

table of contents in april  our board of directors announced the decision to discontinue dividend payments for the foreseeable future in an effort to foster our growth strategy by reinvesting the approximate  of annual dividend distributions back into the company 
the cash dividend of per share  paid on june  to shareholders of record at the close of business on may   was the last dividend paid to shareholders for the foreseeable future 
any reinstatement of future dividend payments is at the discretion of our board of directors 
sufficiency of cash resources we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  of  as discussed in the long term debt section above  we have additional long term borrowing capacity of approximately  available to us through our revolving loan facility  of which   was outstanding as of december  we believe our operating cash flows and our borrowing capacity are sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next twelve months  while maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents 
our most significant use of funds in is expected to be for i budgeted capital expenditures of  to  ii scheduled payments of long term debt of  and iii anticipated interest payments of  as discussed above  throughout the year we may repurchase shares of the company s common stock in the open market at the prevailing market price up to an amount authorized by the board of directors 
a portion of the budgeted capital expenditures is at our discretion and dependent upon our working capital position  operating cash flows and ability to borrow 
we can modify our planned construction and commitments if the results of operations or available capital so require

in determining our future interest obligations  we used the rates in effect at december  the weighted average rate was approximately 
unrecorded purchase obligations include binding commitments for future capital expenditures and services 
recorded obligations include amounts in accounts payable and accrued expenses for external goods and services received as of december  and expected to be settled in cash 
the settlement period for unrecognized tax benefits and potential interest and penalties of cannot be reasonably determined  however  the liabilities are not expected to become due within the next twelve months 

table of contents defined benefit pension plan as required  we contribute to the pension plan  supplemental executive retirement plan and certain post retirement benefits other than pensions other benefits plan collectively the plans  which provide retirement benefits to certain eligible employees 
contributions are intended to provide for benefits attributed to service to date 
our funding policy is to contribute annually an actuarially determined amount consistent with applicable federal income tax regulations 
we stopped accruing benefits for active participants effective april  and we anticipate that future funding requirements will decrease significantly as a result of the freeze of the plans 
however  the significant decline in the equity markets precipitated by the recent credit crisis and financial system instability has negatively affected the value of our pension plan assets 
our minimum funding requirement for related to the pension plan is approximately  however  due to a carryover credit balance of approximately  no cash contribution will be required 
we will continue to evaluate the future funding requirements of the plans and fund them as necessary 
see note for a more detailed discussion regarding our pension plan and other benefits plan 
income taxes the timing of cash payments for income taxes  which is governed by the internal revenue service and other taxing jurisdictions  will differ from the timing of recording tax expense and deferred income taxes  which are reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
for example  tax laws in effect for regarding accelerated or bonus depreciation for tax reporting resulted in less cash payments than the gaap tax expense on continuing and discontinued operations 
acceleration of tax deductions could eventually result in situations where cash payments will exceed gaap tax expense 
changes in tax laws create uncertainty as to when or if this situation will occur within the next three years 
our deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and through the generation of future taxable income from ordinary and recurring operations 
deferred tax assets that are dependent on specific business segments generating future taxable income were determined to be more likely than not to be realized since those segments have at least years in which to generate the estimated required taxable income 
approximately  of future taxable income is estimated to be required to realize these deferred tax assets 
historically  pre tax earning for financial reporting purposes has exceeded the amount of taxable income reported for income tax purposes 
this has primarily occurred due to the acceleration of depreciation deductions for income tax reporting purposes 
regulatory matters as discussed more fully in the regulatory matters section above  the cpuc issued a final decision which will phase down our annual chcf interim draw by  annually  over a year period ending on january  critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of our accounting policies 
our judgments are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
however  
table of contents because future events and the related effects can not be determined with certainty  actual results may differ from our estimates and assumptions and such differences could be material 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
goodwill as discussed more fully in note  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc formerly statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value below its carrying value 
we perform our annual fair value evaluation on november the impairment test for goodwill requires us to estimate the fair value at the reporting unit level 
we have allocated our goodwill to the telephone reporting unit and the kansas city operations reporting unit 
the telecom segment includes the telephone reporting unit 
the broadband segment includes the kansas city operations reporting unit 
for the kansas city operations reporting unit  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow dcf model and a market based approach 
the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are based upon a combination of historical results and trends  new industry developments  future cash flow projections  as well as relevant comparable company earnings multiples for the market based approach 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
we use a weighted average of the various models to estimate the fair value of the kansas city operating reporting unit 
assumptions used in the dcf model include the following cash flow assumptions regarding investment in network facilities  distribution channels and customer base the assumptions underlying these inputs are based upon a combination of historical results and trends  new industry developments and the company s business plans  a weighted average cost of capital based on industry weighted averaged cost of capital  and a terminal growth rate 
the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to the kansas city operations reporting unit was  as of december  when determining the fair value  the use of different estimates or assumptions within the dcf model or other market based approaches could result in a different fair value 
for example  in our dcf model we used a discount rate of and a terminal growth rate of in our assessment of fair value in at november  the fair value of the kansas city operating unit was  and the associated carrying value was  if the discount rate in our dcf model were to increase  the fair value of  would decrease by approximately  which would not result in an impairment of goodwill recorded at the kansas city operations reporting unit  assuming there are no changes to the market based approaches used in the valuation 
as discussed above  the other market based approaches are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
negative changes relating to the kansas city operations could result in a potential impairment of goodwill recorded at the kansas city operations reporting unit 
for the telephone reporting unit  the estimated fair value of our goodwill is determined using a dcf model 
assumptions used in the dcf model for the telephone reporting unit include the following cash flow assumptions regarding investment in network facilities  distribution channels and customer base the assumptions underlying these inputs are based upon a combination of historical results and trends  new industry developments and the company s business plans  
table of contents a weighted average cost of capital based on industry weighted averaged cost of capital  and a terminal growth rate 
the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to the telephone reporting unit was  as of december  when determining the fair value  the use of different estimates or assumptions within the dcf model could result in a different fair value 
for example  we used a discount rate of and a terminal growth rate of in our assessment of fair value in at november   the fair value of the telephone reporting unit was  and the associated carrying value was 
if the discount rate were to increase  the fair value would decrease by approximately  but would not result in an impairment of goodwill recorded at the telephone reporting unit 
revenue recognition as discussed more fully in note  total revenues from telephone services are affected by rates authorized by various regulatory agencies 
the fcc monitors surewest telephone s interstate earnings through its tariff review procedures and the use of annual cost separation studies prepared by surewest telephone 
the fcc establishes rules that carriers must follow in the filing of tariffs and the preparation of the annual studies 
based on these rules  we are required to prospectively set its interstate rates based on the aforementioned cost separation studies 
these cost studies include estimates and assumptions regarding various financial data including operating expenses  taxes and investment in property  plant and equipment 
non financial data estimates are also utilized in the preparation of these cost studies  including projected demand usage and detailed network information 
we must also make estimates of the jurisdictional separation of this data to assign current financial and operating data to the interstate or intrastate jurisdiction 
these estimates are finalized in future periods as actual data becomes available to complete the separation studies 
we also participate in the neca common line pool for certain interstate services and derive revenues from that pool 
as a result of estimates and assumptions  it is reasonably possible that management s estimates of surewest telephone s interstate access revenues and shareable earnings obligations could change in the near term  and the amounts involved could be material 
allowances for doubtful accounts as discussed more fully in note  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
in evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors including a specific customer s or carrier s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical and future expectations of conditions that may impact our ability to collect our accounts receivable 
if circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant  our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
if uncollectibility of our billed revenue changes by  we would expect an increase in uncollectible expense of approximately  as of december   we had three customers that accounted for approximately of our consolidated accounts receivable  net of allowances 
although management believes that these customers are creditworthy  a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material effect on their ability to pay timely and  therefore  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
in addition  certain revenues are subject to refund if the customer terminates services or returns equipment within a stipulated time period  or if certain performance criteria are not met 
accordingly  we maintain accounts receivable allowances and recognize certain customer refund liabilities  through charges to revenues  based on our best estimates of the resolution of these contingencies  which are based on historical experience 

table of contents income taxes as discussed more fully in notes and  we account for income taxes using the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
as we operate in more than one state  changes in our state apportionment factors  based on operational results  may affect our future effective tax rates and the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
on january   we adopted asc topic  income taxes asc formerly fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which changed our methodology for estimating our potential liability for income tax positions for which uncertainty exists regardless of whether taxing authorities will challenge its interpretation of the income tax laws 
under asc  we do not recognize any benefit in our financial statements for any uncertain income tax position if we believe the position in the aggregate has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
if we believe there is greater than likelihood that the position will be sustained  a benefit would be recognized in the financial statements equal to the largest amount that is believed more likely than not to be sustained upon an audit 
pension plan and other post retirement costs and obligations as discussed more fully in note  we have costs and obligations for our pension plan and other benefits plan  which are actuarially determined based on estimates of discount rates and long term rates of return on plan assets 
changes in these estimates and other factors could significantly impact our pension plan and other post retirement benefit costs and obligations 
for the discount rates used for our pension plan and other post retirement benefit obligations were and  respectively 
the discount rates were determined based on current yields on high quality corporate fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations 
the rate used for the other post retirement benefit obligation reflects heavier weighting for retired participants of shorter durations 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost related to the pension plan would have the following effects percentage point increase percentage point decrease recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no

in april  the fasb issued an amendment to this standard by establishing a model to account for certain pre acquisition contingencies formerly fsp fas r  accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies 
under the amendment  an acquirer is required to recognize at fair value an asset acquired or a liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period

our adoption of the standard and amendment  on january   did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
regulatory and legal matters significant portions of surewest telephone s rates and charges are subject to regulation by the fcc and the cpuc 
rates and charges are based on various tariffs filed by surewest and others  including those filed by the neca for cl charges 
pending and future regulatory actions  with respect to these and other matters and the filing of new or amended tariffs  may have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in addition  the emergence of a range of products and services that operate partially or entirely outside traditional regulatory frameworks but that compete with regulated service offerings has created new challenges for both us and the regulators 
our consolidated financial condition and results of operations have been and will be affected by recent and future proceedings before the cpuc and fcc 
pending before the fcc and cpuc are proceedings that  among other things  are considering additional rules governing the opening of markets to competition and the regulation of the competing telecommunications providers  the nature and extent of the compensation  if any  to be paid by carriers and other providers to one another for network use  and the sums to be recovered through end users and other sources  the goals and definition of universal telephone service in a changing environment  including examination of subsidy support mechanisms for subscribers of different carriers including incumbent carriers and in various geographic areas  rules that will provide non discriminatory access by competing service providers to the network capabilities of local exchange carriers  and the regulated rates and earnings of surewest telephone 
there are a number of pending and anticipated other regulatory proceedings occurring at the federal and state levels that may have a material impact on surewest telephone and also on subsidiaries in the broadband segment 
these regulatory proceedings also include newer issues  such as consideration of broadband deployment  network neutrality and regulation of ip enabled services 
the outcomes and impact of these proceedings and related court matters on the telecom segment  the broadband segment and the company as a whole cannot be determined at this time 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and credit risk 
the disclosure is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses  but rather an indicator of reasonably possible losses 
our exposure to market risk is primarily related to the impact of credit risk and interest rate fluctuations in our investment portfolio and debt obligations 
credit risk and interest rate risk in our cash equivalents and investments as of december   we held one  par value auction rate security ars with an estimated fair value of  which was measured using a discounted cash flow dcf model and level inputs 
this ars was collateralized by student loans that are guaranteed primarily by a monoline insurance company and partially by the federal family education loan program ffelp 
we also held an offer right from ubs financial services  inc  a subsidiary of ubs ag ubs  entitling us to sell at par value our ars originally purchased from ubs at anytime during a two year period from june  through july  although we expected to sell our ars under the right  if the right was not exercised before july   it would expire and ubs would have no further rights or obligation to buy our ars 
if ubs had insufficient funding to buy back the ars and the auction process continued to fail  then we may have incurred further losses on the carrying value of the ars 
using a dcf model  the right had an estimated fair value of as of december  the significant estimates that were used as inputs in our dcf models were the credit quality of the issuer  the credit quality of the monoline insurance company  the percentage and the types of guarantees such as the monoline insurance company and ffelp  interest rates  expected holding periods  expected future cash flows  an illiquidity discount factor and ubs s financial ability to repurchase the ars beginning june  we compared the ars and right  when possible  to other observable and relevant market data 
changes in the assumptions of the models are based on dynamic market conditions which could have a significant impact on the valuation of this security and may have resulted in impairment charges for one or both of these securities in the future 
however  on january   ubs exercised their rights under the right to purchase our ars at par for  as a result  during the first quarter of  we will record a gain of on the ars in the condensed consolidated statements of income 
that gain will be largely offset by recording a loss of on the right  due to the cancellation of our put option under the right 
interest rate risks in our debt obligations we enter into debt obligations to fund acquisitions  operations and planned capital expenditures 
at december   we had long term debt outstanding of  of this amount   or  bears interest at fixed rates with a weighted average rate of 
additionally  we had  of outstanding borrowings on our credit facility bearing interest at london interbank offered rate based rates with a weighted average rate of 
based on borrowing rates currently available for loans with similar terms and maturities  the estimated fair value of all of our long term debt as of december  was  we currently have no outstanding short term debt obligations as of december
