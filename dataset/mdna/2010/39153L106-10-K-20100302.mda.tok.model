table of contents financial overview for  revenue totaled million  a decrease from  which included the benefit of an additional week of operations due to our fiscal year ending on the closest friday to december this additional week added approximately million to sales 
during  crm neuromodulation revenue growth was offset by decreases in orthopaedic  vascular and electrochem revenue which were impacted by the uncertain health care and economic environment 
for  sales were million  an increase of over in addition to the extra week of operations  revenue benefitted from our acquisitions in and  which added approximately million of incremental revenue  as well as organic growth of 
over the last three years  we were extremely focused on the integration of our acquisitions 
as a result  we incurred additional costs related to the implementation of numerous cost savings  consolidation and integration initiatives 
additionally  during  we accrued million in connection with our electrochem litigation see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report and incurred a million tradename write down due to the successful rebranding of our greatbatch medical segment

including these charges  operating income for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
additionally  we consistently report and discuss in our quarterly earnings releases and investor presentations adjusted operating income and margin  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share 
these adjusted amounts consist of gaap amounts excluding i acquisition related charges  ii facility consolidation  manufacturing transfer and system integration charges  iii asset write down and disposition charges  iv litigation charges and v the income tax benefit related to these adjustments 
we believe that reporting these amounts provides important supplemental information to our investors and creditors seeking to understand the financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations

adjusted operating income for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage of sales  or adjusted operating margin  was  and 
the decrease in this percentage from was a direct result of our acquisitions 
our goal is to improve adjusted operating margin to approximately over the next three to five years through our initiatives to improve the operating performance of the acquired companies and through the development of innovative products to drive future revenue growth 
evidence of the progress we have made in these initiatives can be seen in the improvement of adjusted operating margin from to our adjusted operating margin is expected to be between and for

table of contents we completed five acquisitions in and two in the first two months of these acquisitions were enabled by our cash position and the financing we put in place during during  we generated million of cash flow from operations compared to million and million in and  respectively 
this improvement is a direct result of the strategic initiatives discussed in cost savings and consolidation efforts  which were designed to improve operational efficiency 
as of january   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of debt including million that comes due in june the remaining debt matures in and ceo message i am proud of our strategic accomplishments in this year provided additional evidence of our execution and progress towards achieving both our short term operational goals and long term strategic objectives 
with that said  i was not satisfied with the level of revenue we achieved in despite the turbulent global economy and uncertain healthcare environment  the markets we operate in provide us opportunities 
we have taken and will continue to take measures and actions that enable us to capitalize on those opportunities 
improving operating performance is a critical part of our long term plan to drive shareholder value 
during  we completed a number of strategic initiatives designed to improve operational efficiency  including the consolidation of five facilities  the completion of four erp system and back office integrations  and the streamlining of our orthopaedic operations to improve on time delivery and lead time 
additionally  during  we took steps and made difficult cost cutting decisions to help offset the impact of lower revenue levels and higher r d investment on our profitability 
the benefit of these initiatives can be seen in our financial results  which included the achievement of our adjusted operating margin goal for  growth in cash flow from operations to million as well as the expansion of our gross margin to 
i consider these significant accomplishments given the difficult operating environment 
we will continue to institute our operating discipline to improve performance  and are making strategic investments to drive both new product developments as well as greater operational efficiency 
we are certain that our dedication to improving the business and closely following our strategic priorities has placed us in a strong position to benefit as the broader economy and healthcare industry improves and to experience continued success in and beyond 
product development currently  we are developing a series of new products for customer applications in the crm  neuromodulation  vascular access  orthopaedic and electrochem markets 
some of the key development initiatives include to continue to develop complete systems solutions for our oem customers in the markets we operate in  to continue the evolution of our q series high rate icd batteries  to continue development of mri compatible leadwires and other neuromodulation products  to continue development of higher energy higher density capacitors  to integrate biomimetic coating technology with therapy delivery devices  to complete the design of next generation steerable catheters and introducers  to further develop minimally invasive surgical techniques for the orthopaedics industry  to develop disposable instrumentation for the orthopaedics industry  to provide wireless sensing solutions to electrochem customers  and to develop a charging platform for electrochem s secondary offering 

table of contents approximately million of the biomec purchase price in april was allocated to the estimated fair value of acquired ipr d projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use  thus were immediately expensed on the date of acquisition 
the value assigned to ipr d related to projects that incorporate biomec s novel polymer coating biomimetic technology that mimics the surface of endothelial cells of blood vessels 
an agreement was reached in with an oem partner to provide coating material and services for their catheter products 
the k application was approved by the food and drug administration fda and sales began in  which did not materially impact our results of operations 
there have been no significant changes from our original estimates with regard to these projects 
approximately million of the enpath purchase price in june was allocated to the estimated fair value of acquired ipr d projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use  thus were immediately expensed on the date of acquisition 
these projects primarily represent the next generation of introducer and catheter products already being sold  which incorporate new enhancements and customer modifications 
one introducer project was launched near the end of we expect to commercially launch the other introducer products under development in  which will replace existing products 
these introducer projects acquired have been delayed due to the timing of customer adoption and resolution of technical difficulties on some of the projects 
additionally  future sales from our viaseal tm introducer project are uncertain due to litigation see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
the catheter ipr d project  to which a portion of the enpath purchase price was allocated  has been put on hold indefinitely in order to allocate resources to other projects 
the lost revenue from the delays in these introducer and catheter projects are expected to be partially offset with revenue from other projects initiated after the acquisition of enpath 
approximately million of the precimed purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of acquired ipr d projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use  thus were immediately expensed on the date of acquisition 
the value assigned to ipr d related to reamer  instrument kit  locking plate and cutting guide projects 
these projects primarily represent the next generation of products already being sold  which incorporate new enhancements and customer modifications 
we commercially launched two of these products in  one in and another is expected in two of the other orthopaedic projects acquired have been delayed and three have been cancelled due to the timing of customer adoption  technical difficulties and the inability of the projects to meet margin feasibility assessments 
these changes are not expected to have a material impact on operating income as these projects were expected to have lower operating margins 
our critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
our most critical accounting estimates are described below 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

table of contents balance sheet caption effect of nature of critical variations of key estimate item assumptions approach used assumptions used valuation of goodwill  other identifiable intangible assets and ipr d when we acquire a company  we allocate the purchase price to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair value at the date of acquisition 
we then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets  including ipr d 
other indefinite lived intangible assets  such as trademarks and tradenames  are considered non amortizing intangible assets as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely 
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill are required to be assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequent if certain indicators are present 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are assessed for impairment if certain indicators are present 
we base the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets including ipr d on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined using one of three valuation approaches market  income and cost 
the selection of a particular method for a given asset depends on the reliability of available data and the nature of the asset  among other considerations 
the market approach values the subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets 
the income approach values the subject asset based on the present value of risk adjusted cash flows projected to be generated by the asset 
the projected cash flows for each asset considers multiple factors  including current revenue from existing customers  attrition trends  reasonable contract renewal assumptions from the perspective of a marketplace participant  and expected profit margins giving consideration to historical and expected margins 
the cost approach values the subject asset by determining the current cost of replacing that asset with another of equivalent economic utility 
the cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the asset  less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation or obsolescence  with specific consideration given to economic obsolescence if indicated 
we perform an annual review on the last day of each fiscal year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired 
we assess goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value to determine if there is potential impairment 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
fair values for reporting units are determined based in part on the income approach  and where appropriate  the market approach or appraised values are also considered 
definite lived intangible assets such as purchased technology  patents and customer lists are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life 
indefinite lived intangible assets such as trademarks and tradenames are evaluated for impairment by using the income approach 
the use of alternative valuation assumptions  including estimated cash flows and discount rates  and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different purchase price allocations 
in arriving at the value of the ipr d  we additionally consider among other factors the in process projects stage of completion  commercial feasibility of the project  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the projected costs to complete  the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could impact the value of the assets and liabilities recorded which would change the amount and timing of future intangible asset amortization expense 
we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the determination of the expected future cash flows from our reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing 
these include sales growth  cost of capital  and projections of future cash flows 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could create future impairment losses to our goodwill 
for indefinite lived assets such as trademarks and tradenames  we make certain estimates of revenue streams  royalty rates and other future benefits 
significant changes in these estimates could create future impairments of these indefinite lived intangible assets 
estimation of the useful lives of definite lived intangible assets are based upon the estimated cash flows of the respective intangible asset and requires significant management judgment 
events could occur that would materially affect our estimates of the useful lives 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could change the amount of future amortization expense or could create future impairments of these definite lived intangible assets 
a change in the amortization of our intangible assets would increase decrease net income by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 
as of january   we have million of intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet representing of total assets 
this includes million of amortizing intangible assets  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of goodwill 

table of contents balance sheet caption effect of nature of critical variations of key estimate item assumptions approach used assumptions used stock based compensation we record compensation costs related to our stock based awards which include stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units 
we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
compensation cost for service based awards is recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period 
compensation cost for performance based awards is reassessed each period and recognized based upon the probability that the performance targets will be achieved 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
the total expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that ultimately vest 
we utilize the black scholes options pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
we are required to make certain assumptions with respect to selected black scholes model inputs  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the stock options 
the expected life of stock options granted  which represents the period of time that the stock options are expected to be outstanding  is based  primarily  on historical data 
the expected dividend yield is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected life 
for restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards  the fair market value is determined based upon the closing value of our stock price on the grant date 
compensation cost for performance based awards is reassessed each period and recognized based upon the probability that the performance targets will be achieved 
that assessment is based upon our actual and expected future performance as well as that of the individuals who have been granted performance based awards 
stock based compensation expense is only recorded for those awards that are expected to vest 
forfeiture estimates for determining appropriate stock based compensation expense are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and demographic characteristics 
revisions are made to those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values  existing valuation models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
there are significant differences among valuation models 
this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved in selecting assumptions to be utilized to determine fair value and forfeiture assumptions 
if factors change and result in different assumptions in future periods  the expense that we record for future grants may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
additionally  changes in performance of the company or individuals who have been granted performance based awards that affect the likelihood that performance based targets are achieved could materially impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized 
a change in our stock based compensation expense would increase decrease net income by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 

table of contents balance sheet caption effect of nature of critical variations of key estimate item assumptions approach used assumptions used inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out method  or market 
inventory costing requires complex calculations that include assumptions for overhead absorption  scrap  sample calculations  manufacturing yield estimates and the determination of which costs may be capitalized 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality 
variations in methods or assumptions could have a material impact on our results 
if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory write downs or expense a greater amount of overhead costs  which would have a negative impact on our net income 
a write down of our inventory would decrease net income by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 
as of january  we have million of inventory recorded on our balance sheet representing of total assets 
tangible long lived assets property  plant and equipment and other tangible long lived assets are carried at cost 
the cost of property  plant and equipment is charged to depreciation expense over the estimated life of the operating assets primarily using straight line rates 
tangible long lived assets are subject to impairment assessment 
we assess the impairment of tangible long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include a significant decrease in the market price of the asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recoverability potential is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the related total future undiscounted cash flows 
the projected cash flows for each asset group considers multiple factors  including current revenue from existing customers  proceeds from the sale of the asset group  reasonable contract renewal assumptions from the perspective of a marketplace participant  and expected profit margins giving consideration to historical and expected margins 
if an asset group s carrying value is not recoverable through related cash flows  the asset group is considered to be impaired 
impairment is measured by comparing the asset group s carrying amount to its fair value 
when it is determined that useful lives of assets are shorter than originally estimated  and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets  we accelerate the rate of depreciation in order to fully depreciate the assets over their shorter useful lives 
estimation of the useful lives of tangible assets that are long lived requires significant management judgment 
events could occur  including changes in cash flow that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation 
unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter the assumptions regarding the ability to realize the return of our investment in long lived assets 
also  as we make manufacturing process conversions and other facility consolidation decisions  we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of our assets  primarily manufacturing equipment and buildings 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could change the amount of future depreciation expense or could create future impairments of these long lived assets 
a write down in our tangible long lived assets would decrease net income by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 
as of january  we have million of tangible long lived assets recorded on our balance sheet representing of total assets 

table of contents balance sheet caption effect of nature of critical variations of key estimate item assumptions approach used assumptions used provision for income taxes in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred 
the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the changes in differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that management estimates will be in effect when the differences reverse 
in relation to recording the provision for income taxes  management must estimate the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of temporary differences  make certain assumptions regarding whether book tax differences are permanent or temporary and if temporary  the related timing of expected reversal 
also  estimates are made as to whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
alternatively  we may make estimates about the potential usage of deferred tax assets that decrease our valuation allowances 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when we believe that certain tax positions do not meet the more likely than not threshold 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of a tax audit or the lapse of the statute of limitations 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate 
changes could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes 
changes in current tax laws and tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  thereby changing the income tax provision 
also  significant declines in taxable income could materially impact the realizable value of deferred tax assets 
at january   we had million of deferred tax assets on our balance sheet and a valuation allowance of million has been established for certain deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
a change in the effective tax rate would impact the current year benefit by million  and diluted loss per share by per diluted share
