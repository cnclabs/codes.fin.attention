overview lumber liquidators is the largest specialty retailer of hardwood flooring in the united states  based on industry sources and our experience 
we believe we have achieved a reputation for offering great value  superior service and a broad selection of high quality hardwood flooring products 
we offer an extensive selection of premium hardwood flooring products under multiple proprietary brands at everyday low prices designed to appeal to a diverse customer base 
substantially all of our products are purchased directly from mills or associated brokers with whom we have cultivated long standing relationships to ensure a consistent supply of high quality product at the lowest prices 
we believe that our vertically integrated business model enables us to offer a broad assortment of high quality products to our customers at a lower cost than our competitors 
we believe that our brands  value proposition and integrated multi channel approach are important competitive advantages in a hardwood flooring market that is highly fragmented 
we compete on the basis of price  quality  selection and availability of the wood flooring that we offer our customers  as well as the level of customer service we can provide 
we position ourselves as hardwood flooring experts and believe our high level of customer service reflects this positioning 
we offer our products through multiple  complementary channels  including lumber liquidators stores in states at december   a full service call center in toano  virginia  our website and our catalog 
we seek to appeal to customers who desire a high quality product at an attractive value and are willing to travel to less convenient locations to get it 
we sell our products principally to existing homeowners  who we believe represent over of our customer count 
historically  these homeowners are in their mid s or older  are well educated and have been living in their homes for at least several years 
we have grown our store base rapidly with over of our total store locations opened in the past three years  including new stores in we believe our existing primary and secondary metropolitan markets will benefit from additional store locations  and in  we opened new store locations in these markets 
our experience has shown that our store model is well suited for markets smaller than the primary and secondary metropolitan areas  and going forward  these will represent the majority of our new market stores 
we expect to open to new store locations in each of the next few years  with an approximately equal mix of new markets and existing markets 
our recent store opening activity is as follows number of stores at january new stores number of stores at december due primarily to the weak macroeconomic environment and its impact on the residential flooring market  net sales at our comparable stores in were unchanged from their net sales in we generally consider a store comparable on the first day of the th month of operation  and stores in operation from months to months have historically shown greater net sales increases than our more mature stores 
comparable store net sales had previously contributed to our total net sales growth  with increases of in and in as the residential flooring market slowly strengthens from low points in  we expect our comparable store net sales to again show increases 
however  we believe increases in baseline store volumes and new store openings in existing markets will generally result in comparable store net sales increases lower than increases in and earlier years 
we continue to invest in the infrastructure supporting our store growth and operations  with focus in more recent years on broadening our product assortment  enhancing our store management training programs  strengthening our in stock inventory position  reducing transportation costs and seeking integrated technology solutions to increase both our operational effectiveness and efficiency 
our gross profit is driven primarily by the cost of acquiring the products we sell from our suppliers  but also includes international and domestic transportation costs  customs and duty charges  transportation charges from our distribution center 
table of contents to our stores and the cost of delivering product purchases to the customer 
our gross margin has expanded since the latter half of due primarily to our infrastructure investments 
labor costs and advertising expenses have historically been our most significant operating expenses 
our in store labor costs have increased primarily as a result of our store base growth  and together with our infrastructure investments  total labor costs have increased as a percentage of net sales 
our annual advertising costs have increased as we continue to support our brand and implement direct sales generation programs in support of our growth  but we continue to leverage those expenses across a larger store base 
overall  we expect operating margins to expand as we continue to grow our store base and our comparable store net sales increase 
we completed our initial public offering in november we reorganized effective december   creating a new holding company structure  and as a result  a new parent company named lumber liquidators holdings  inc was formed 
outstanding shares of the common stock of the former parent company  which was named lumber liquidators  inc  were automatically converted  on a share for share basis  into identical shares of common stock of the new holding company 
highlights sales volume and consumer traffic increases 
in  net sales increased million  or from  driven by increases in our total sales volume  primarily measured in square footage 
in both comparable stores  where net sales were unchanged comparing to  and non comparable stores  consumer demand continued to shift our mix of products sold  or sales mix  to certain key product lines which generally have a lower than average retail price 
as a result  in comparing to  our average retail price per unit sold decreased approximately  and our average sale decreased approximately  to  applying our average sale to total net sales implies a total increase in the number of customers invoiced of  and at comparable stores  an increase of 
gross margin expansion 
gross margin expanded to for  continuing to benefit from changes in our product line sales mix  as well as our effective execution of initiatives in store operations  merchandising and logistics 
though customer demand continued to shift towards product lines that generally carry a lower than average retail price point  customers continued to prefer the premium products within those product lines 
in  gross margin was and included approximately basis points of benefit related to certain special liquidation deals and a retroactive rebate of a bamboo tariff 
merchandise inventories investment 
merchandise inventories at december  increased million from december   as available for sale inventory increased million and inbound in transit inventory increased million 
we consider merchandise inventories either available for sale or inbound in transit  based on whether we have physically received the products at our central distribution center in toano  virginia  at an individual store location  or in another facility where we control and monitor inspection  including the china consolidation center 
the increase in both available for sale inventory and inbound in transit inventory resulted from two primary factors  a planned build in preparation for the annual interruption in merchandise flow from asia due to the chinese new year and the launch of a new merchandise inventories initiative 
in the fourth quarter of  we launched an initiative to strengthen our in stock commitment to our top selling products by region across all product lines 
the products selected have generally represented our top selling products over a longer period of time  significantly reducing the risk of obsolescence 
our strengthening of in stock positions at the store level guarantees a certain level of inventory available for future sales orders 
we believe this further enhances our value proposition  and we expect to have this program fully in place by the end of the first quarter of merchandise inventories and available inventory per store in operation on december were as follows in thousands inventory available for sale inventory inbound in transit total merchandise inventories available inventory per store 
table of contents china consolidation center 
in september  we implemented a pilot program where certain quantities of designated products produced in asia are shipped in bulk to the consolidation center in shanghai  china where our product allocation department determines an appropriate mix of a number of products to be packed in a single container and shipped directly to a store location 
the majority of our stores do not have sufficient warehouse capacity to allow direct shipment of containers of a single product or a small number of products 
the pilot program included approximately stores primarily on the west coast and a limited number of our products 
through december   the consolidation center had shipped nearly million square feet sft of product  of which some million sft had been received directly by our store locations  including approximately million sft in december alone 
we expect this logistics alternative to grow in volume throughout as additional stores and products are added to the program 
external factors impacting our business the wood flooring market for homeowners is highly fragmented and dependent on home related discretionary spending  which is influenced by a number of complex economic and demographic factors that may vary locally  regionally and nationally 
we are impacted by home remodeling activity  employment levels  housing turnover  real estate prices  new housing starts  consumer confidence  credit availability and the general health of consumer discretionary spending 
many of the economic indicators associated with the wood flooring market and more generally associated with consumer discretionary spending were weak throughout  following the unusual turbulence in the economy in the fourth quarter of though we believe we have seen early signs of stabilization in the second half of  the wood flooring market is likely to remain in a weakened state in  with only gradual recovery expected as the year progresses 
we believe the number of retailers serving the homeowner based segment of the wood flooring market will continue to decline and present an opportunity for market share growth  primarily through store base expansion 
in addition  we also believe that the longer term trends for our industry are favorable  including customer perception of hardwood flooring as an attractive alternative to other floor coverings  home improvement spending  home ownership  increasing home size and demographic trends

risk factors risks related to our business and industry 
assessing the performance of our business in assessing the performance of our business  we consider a variety of performance and financial measures 
the key measures we use to determine how our business is performing are net sales  including the growth in our store base and comparable store net sales  and the gross profit and gross margin of those net sales 
some of the operational metrics that we consider in evaluating net sales include our product line sales mix  our average sale and implied number of customers invoiced  future demand as measured by open orders and the related customer deposits  the average number of days an order customer deposit is outstanding  requests for samples and catalogs  new store performance levels and our new store pipeline 
in assessing the overall performance of our business  we also consider selling  general and administrative expenses  including labor costs and advertising expenses 
net sales 
we derive net sales primarily from sales of solid and engineered hardwoods  laminate  resilient  bamboo and cork flooring products  moldings and flooring accessories made through our stores  call center  website and catalogs 
net sales  which include freight costs billed to customers  are net of any returns by customers 
net sales from customer orders placed through the call center  our website or our catalogs are recorded by the store where the customer picks up the merchandise or schedules delivery 
several factors affect our net sales in any period  including the number of stores in operation and comparable store net sales for any given store or group of stores  which can be influenced by our operational effectiveness  pricing  marketing and promotional efforts  brand recognition levels  local competition and trade area demographics 
growth in our store base 
we opened stores in  stores in and stores in  which contributed substantially to the growth of our net sales in those years 
we plan to open between and new stores during each of the next several years 
our new stores require a minimal capital investment  primarily merchandise inventory  showroom display fixtures and point of sale equipment 
we are able to adapt a range of existing buildings in a market and open a new store quickly 
our new stores have historically opened with an initial ramp up period typically lasting approximately months during which they have generated net sales below the levels at which we expect them to normalize 
our average new store across our markets has  however  historically become profitable within three months of beginning operations and generally returned its initial cash investment within one year

risk factors risks related to our business and industry 
comparable store net sales 
the other important driver of growth in our net sales has been increased comparable store net sales  which have accounted for a substantial portion of our historical net sales growth 
stores generally enter the 
table of contents comparable store base on the first day of the thirteenth full calendar month after they open 
various factors affect comparable store net sales  including consumer preferences  buying trends and overall economic trends and our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to changes therein  changes in product assortment and the overall sales mix  the number of stores we open in existing markets  the maturity of a comparable store  competition  pricing  product availability and quality  the timing of our advertising promotional events and or timing of three day holiday weekends  and weather and other climatological effects 
we believe increases in baseline store volumes and new store openings in existing markets  which tend to open at a higher base level of net sales  will generally result in future comparable store net sales increases lower than increases in and earlier years 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business and industry 
gross profit and gross margin 
gross profit is equal to our net sales minus our cost of sales  and gross margin is equal to gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
our gross profit has historically been affected by  among other things our sales volumes and the margins on products we sell  the mix of our products sold and the related cost of that merchandise  including  in particular  the cost of hardwood and other flooring products and accessories  transportation costs  both from our suppliers to our distribution centers or stores and from our distribution centers to our stores  which may vary with factors such as international container rates and fuel costs  customs and duty charges on international purchases  the cost of third party carrier services providing customer deliveries  in house finishing costs  particularly for our bellawood brand  the costs of providing samples requested by our customers  inventory adjustments  including shrinkage  the extent of any retail price reductions and the volume of inventory impacted by sales and promotional events  and competition 
we try to minimize the volatility of hardwood prices  which represents the largest portion of our cost of sales  by relying on our close relationships with our suppliers and utilizing our financial flexibility to establish beneficial payment terms 
generally  we strive to match merchandise purchase lead times with anticipated demand to maximize sustainable gross margins  and those lead times currently range by product from approximately to days 
we work to improve gross profit and gross margin on an ongoing basis through inventory management improvements  logistics alternatives  pricing levels  promotional activities and vendor relationships  among other things 
several of our recent initiatives to position our business for more effective future growth have also had a significant impact on our gross margins  and we continue to assess various opportunities 
we review our inventory levels and sales mix on a regular basis to identify slow moving merchandise and products which do not meet our quality standards and cannot be sold at full price  and generally use promotional events and mark downs to clear such inventory 
we believe that  taken together  the changes we have made and intend to implement should enable us to sustain and gradually increase our gross margins in future periods 
our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to other companies that record different costs as components of cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
labor costs 
one of the largest components of our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses is labor 
the majority of our labor costs  which include salaries  commissions and benefits  relate to staff at our stores and in our distribution network 
in recent years  however  labor costs have increased as we enhanced our store support and operational infrastructure  including key areas impacting our gross margin such as merchandise planning  product allocation and 
table of contents logistics 
we believe these investments in store support infrastructure position our business for more effective and sustainable future growth 
advertising expenses 
we have made a significant investment at the national  regional and local level to develop our national brands  including our portfolio of proprietary product offerings 
we believe lumber liquidators is now recognized across the united states as a destination for high quality hardwood flooring at everyday low prices 
we have historically focused on national advertising  including targeted television advertising and co sponsorship of television shows  sports marketing  national print publications and radio 
we are currently placing additional focus on direct mail efforts that have a more direct link to driving demand for our products  including specific call to action messaging 
we are also emphasizing local advertising to support targeted store growth and in connection with new store openings  while maintaining appropriate levels of national advertising 
we continue to see greater returns on our investment in national advertising as we open more stores near potential customers who have already been introduced to our brands 
using our integrated marketing approach of both traditional and new media allows us flexibility to allocate our advertising spend where we believe it will derive the most benefit 
in addition  while our advertising costs may vary from quarter to quarter with shifts in marketing strategy and the timing of our marketing campaigns  we believe that the percentage of our net sales devoted to advertising will generally decline as we continue to grow

other expenses 
our sg a expenses also include occupancy costs for our stores  warehouse and headquarters including rent  utilities  real estate taxes and maintenance charges  stock based compensation expenses  depreciation and amortization  and other expenses including legal and professional fees  credit and debit card discount and processing fees  bank fees  and other corporate and administrative functions that support our stores 
sg a expenses also include store opening costs  which we expense as they are incurred 
we were party to a stock based agreement between the founder and his brother  one of our regional managers until december  accounted for as a variable performance plan the variable plan  which is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of our initial public offering and the variable plan  our stock based compensation expense significantly impacted our operating results and net income in and results of operations the following tables set forth components of our results of operations for the periods indicated  both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales

in addition to the demand increase discussed in highlights  net sales increased due principally to the following factors net sales benefited from more consistent in stock positions of certain key product lines  including product lines customers expect to be in stock at a store location  such as laminates  moldings and accessories 
our sales mix of moldings and accessories increased to of total net sales in  from in these benefits were partially offset by decreased net sales in certain hardwood product lines  including bellawood  engineered and unfinished 
comparable store net sales benefited from the continued maturation of stores in operation for to months at december   where net sales increased 
net sales at these comparable stores generally increase faster than at our stores in operation for more than months  which decreased 
we believe our stores in operation for more than months are more likely to be adversely impacted by the opening of non comparable stores in an existing market 
excluding the net sales of markets which include a non comparable store and at least one comparable store older than months  net sales at these more mature stores increased 
gross profit and gross margin 
for the year ended december  dollars in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit gross margin gross profit in increased million  or  to million in from million in gross margin improved basis points in as compared to primarily due to the following we continued our investment in infrastructure initiatives within key functional areas impacting our product assortment  product flow and commitment to in stock positions  including product planning  allocation and logistics 
as a result  we believe we have driven certain sales mix changes  shortened the distance the product travels between the vendor mill and the final sales floor  and reduced the cost of our products and the related transportation 
our efforts to broaden our assortment of moldings and accessories while remaining committed to an available in stock position have increased the sales mix of this key product line  which generally carries gross margins higher than our average 
in addition to our efforts to drive sales mix increases in certain key product lines and the premium products within those product lines  we believe the weakness in the macroeconomic environment throughout has also resulted in a shift away from certain hardwood product lines that generally carry higher than average retail prices per unit sold  but slightly lower than average gross margins 
together with our logistics initiatives to reduce both domestic and international transportation costs  gross margin in the second half of benefited from favorable international container rates in comparison to the rates impacting we believe lower international container rates in the second half of in comparison to our 
table of contents historic average container rates resulted in up to basis points of gross margin benefit in the third and fourth quarters 
we expect our international container rates to remain generally lower than our historic average at least into early  though with moderating benefit

overall  net sales increased due principally to the following factors a broader assortment of premium products in certain key product lines such as handscraped hardwoods  bamboo and laminate products offered under a number of our proprietary brands  continued to drive increased demand 
partially offsetting this benefit were decreases in the sales mix of certain bellawood and certain other hardwoods which generally carry higher than average retail prices per unit sold 
net sales of moldings and accessories increased and represented of net sales in  up from of net sales in  as we continued to broaden our assortment and strengthened our commitment to a more consistent in stock position 
the increased availability of special liquidation deals in allowed us to add selective merchandise offerings that presented a value opportunity for the customer while creating promotional opportunities for us to drive incremental consumer traffic  a portion of which was converted to demand for our proprietary brands 
comparable store net sales were driven primarily by the continued maturation of stores in operation for to months at december   where net sales increased

these initiatives began in the third and fourth quarter of and continued throughout liquidation deals favorably impacted gross margin in three ways in the second quarter of  we strengthened our merchandising staff to enhance our focus on the entire product cycle of liquidation deals  an important component of both our product assortment and our promotional marketing campaigns 
certain special higher than average quality and unit count liquidation deals were available throughout  but particularly in the first and second quarters

table of contents contractual commitments and contingencies our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  are summarized in the following table payments due by period total less than year to years to years years in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations included in this table is the base period or current renewal period for our operating leases 
the operating leases generally contain varying renewal provisions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or other financing activities with special purpose entities 
inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements recognition of net sales we recognize net sales for products purchased at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise 
we recognize service revenue  which consists primarily of freight charges for in home delivery  when the service has been rendered 
we report revenue net of sales and use taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental taxing authorities 
net sales are reduced by an allowance for anticipated sales returns that we estimate based on historical sales trends and experience 
any reasonably likely changes that may occur in the assumptions underlying our allowance estimates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance 
in addition  customers who do not take immediate delivery of their purchases are generally required to leave a deposit of up to of the sales amount with the balance payable when the products are delivered 
these customer deposits benefit our cash flow and return on investment capital  since we receive partial payment for our customers purchases immediately 
we record these deposits as a liability on our balance sheet under the line item customer deposits and store credits until the customer takes possession of the merchandise 
merchandise inventories we value our merchandise inventories at the lower of merchandise cost or market value 
we determine merchandise cost using the average cost method 
all of the hardwood flooring we purchase from suppliers is either prefinished or unfinished  and in immediate saleable form 
to the extent that we finish and box unfinished products  we include those costs in the average unit cost of related merchandise inventory 
in determining market value  we make judgments and estimates as to the market value of our products  based on factors such as historical results and current sales trends 
any reasonably likely changes that may occur in those assumptions in the future may require us to record charges for losses or obsolescence against these assets  but would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance 

table of contents stock based compensation we currently maintain a single equity incentive plan under which we may grant non qualified stock options  incentive stock options and restricted shares to employees and non employee directors 
we recognize expense for our stock based compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted 
measured compensation cost is recognized ratably over the service period of the related stock based compensation award 
the fair value of stock options was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes merton valuation model 
in order to determine the related stock based compensation expense  we used the following assumptions for stock options granted during expected life of years  expected stock price volatility of to  risk free interest rates from to  and dividends are not expected to be paid in any year 
the expected stock price volatility range is based on the historical volatilities of companies included in a peer group that was selected by management whose shares or options are publicly available 
the volatilities are estimated for a period of time equal to the expected life of the related option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield of us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term 
the expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is determined by considering the contractual terms  vesting schedule and expectations of future employee behavior 
had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options  our stock based compensation expense and result of operations could have been different 
self insurance effective june   we self insure for certain employee health benefit claims 
management estimates a liability for aggregate losses below stop loss coverage limits based on estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims not reported as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors including historical trends  actuarial assumptions and economic conditions 
this liability could be affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amendments that delayed the effective date of the fair value disclosure requirements for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities 
we adopted this standard on january  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  fasb issued an accounting standard regarding interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
this standard requires interim disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments that were previously required only annually and certain additional disclosures regarding the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments 
we adopted this standard on july  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  fasb established the fasb accounting standards codification the codification and in doing so  authorized the codification as the sole source for authoritative us gaap 
other than resolving certain minor inconsistencies in current us gaap  the codification does not change us gaap 
instead  it is intended to make it easier to find and research us gaap applicable to particular transactions or specific accounting issues by organizing accounting pronouncements into approximately accounting topics 
the codification is the single source of authoritative us gaap 
the codification is effective for financial statements issued for reporting periods ending after september  the application of the codification did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements  however  all references to authoritative accounting literature will now be references in accordance with the codification 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash and cash equivalents 
we invest our cash in short term investments with maturities of three months or less 
changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn  
table of contents and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  any future borrowings under our revolving credit agreement would be exposed to interest rate risk due to the variable rate of the facility 
we currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future 
however  in the future  in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks  we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments  although we have not historically done so 
we do not  and do not intend to  engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit
