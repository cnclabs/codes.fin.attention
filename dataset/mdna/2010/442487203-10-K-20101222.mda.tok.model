item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
active selling communities communities approved homes homes delivered contracted not delivered remaining homes available northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west total includes home sites under option 
of the total remaining homes available   were under construction or completed including models and sales offices and  were under option 
excludes three homes in backlog for communities in planning 
backlog at october  and  including unconsolidated joint ventures  we had a backlog of signed contracts for  homes and  homes  respectively  with sales values aggregating billion and billion  respectively 
the majority of our backlog at october  is expected to be completed and closed within the next months 
at november  and  our backlog of signed contracts  including unconsolidated joint ventures  was  homes and  homes  respectively  with sales values aggregating billion and billion  respectively 
sales of our homes typically are made pursuant to a standard sales contract that provides the customer with a statutorily mandated right of rescission for a period ranging up to days after execution 
this contract requires a nominal customer deposit at the time of signing 
in addition  in the northeast  mid atlantic  and some sections of the midwest and southeast  we typically obtain an additional to down payment due within to days after signing 
the contract may include a financing contingency  which permits customers to cancel their obligation in the event mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates including financing arranged or provided by us is unobtainable within the period specified in the contract 
this contingency period typically is four to eight weeks follo wing the date of execution 
when housing values decline in certain markets  some customers cancel their contracts and forfeit their deposits 
cancellation rates are discussed further in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales contracts are included in backlog once the sales contract is signed by the customer  which in some cases includes contracts that are in the rescission or cancellation periods 
however  revenues from sales of homes are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations  when title to the home is conveyed to the buyer  adequate initial and continuing investment have been received and there is no continued involvement 
residential land inventory in planning it is our objective to control a supply of land  primarily through options  consistent with anticipated homebuilding requirements in each of our housing markets 
controlled land as of october   exclusive of communities under development described above under active selling communities and excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  is summarized in the following table 
the proposed developable home sites in communities under development are included in the  consolidated total home sites under the total residential real estate chart in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
communities in planning dollars in thousands number of proposed communities proposed developable home sites total land option price book value northeast under option owned total mid atlantic under option owned total midwest under option owned total southeast under option owned total southwest under option owned total west under option owned total totals under option owned combined total properties under option also include costs incurred on properties not under option but which are under evaluation 
for properties under option  as of october   option fees and deposits aggregated approximately million 
as of october   we spent an additional million in nonrefundable predevelopment costs on such properties 
the book value of million included the amount on the consolidated balance sheets identified as inventories land and land options held for future development or sale  as well as million for specific performance options  and million for deposits on variable interest entity property reported under consolidated inventory not owned 
we either option or acquire improved or unimproved home sites from land developers or other sellers 
under a typical agreement with the land developer  we purchase a minimal number of home sites 
the balance of the home sites to be purchased is covered under an option agreement or a nonrecourse purchase agreement 
as a result of the declining homebuilding market  we have decided to mothball or stop development on certain communities for which we have determined that current market conditions do not justify further investment at this time 
when we decide to mothball a community  the inventory is reclassified from sold and unsold homes and lots under development to land and land options held for future development or sale 
see note to the consolidated financial state ments for further discussion on mothballed communities 
for additional financial information regarding our homebuilding segments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
competition our homebuilding operations are highly competitive 
we are among the top homebuilders in the united states in both homebuilding revenues and home deliveries 
we compete with numerous real estate developers in each of the geographic areas in which we operate 
our competition ranges from small local builders to larger regional builders to publicly owned builders and developers  some of which have greater sales and financial resources than we do 
previously owned homes and the availability of rental housing provide additional competition 
we compete primarily on the basis of reputation  price  location  design  quality  service  and amenities 
regulation and environmental matters we are subject to various local  state  and federal statutes  ordinances  rules  and regulations concerning zoning  building design  construction  and similar matters  including local regulations which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular locality 
in addition  we are subject to registration and filing requirements in connection with the construction  advertisement  and sale of our communities in certain states and localities in which we operate even if all necessary government approvals have been obtained 
we may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums that could be implemented in the future in the states in which we operate 
generally  such moratoriums relate to insufficient water or sewerage facilities or inadequate road capacity 
in addition  some state and local governments in markets where we operate have approved  and others may approve  slow growth or no growth initiatives that could negatively affect the availability of land and building opportunities within those areas 
approval of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to build and sell homes in the affected markets and or could require the satisfaction of additional administrative and regulatory requirements  which could result in slowing the progress or increasing the costs of our homebuilding operations in these markets 
any such delays or costs could have a negative effect on our future revenues and earnings 
we are also subject to a variety of local  state  federal  and foreign laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment environmental laws 
the particular environmental laws which apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site  the site s environmental conditions  and the present and former uses of the site 
these environmental laws may result in delays  may cause us to incur substantial compliance  remediation  and or other costs  and prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity 
despite our past ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals for our communities  we anticipate that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future 
although we cannot predict the effect of these requirements  they could result in time consuming and expensive compliance programs and in substantial expenditures  which could cause delays and increase our cost of operations 
in addition  the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as changes in policies  rules  and regulations and their interpretation and application 
item a risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the other information included in this form k 
the homebuilding industry is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  real estate markets  and weather and other environmental conditions  which could affect our ability to build homes at prices our customers are willing or able to pay  could reduce profits that may not be recaptured  could result in cancellation of sales contracts  and could affect our liquidity 
the homebuilding industry is cyclical  has from time to time experienced significant difficulties  and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions such as employment levels and job growth  availability of financing for home buyers  interest rates  foreclosure rates  inflation  adverse changes in tax laws  consumer confidence  housing demand  population growth  and availability of water supply in locations in which we operate 
turmoil in the financial markets could affect our liquidity 
in addition  our cash balances are primarily invested in short term government backed instruments 
the remaining cash balances are held at numerous financial institutions and may  at times  exceed insurable amounts 
we believe we help to mitigate this risk by depositing our cash in major financial institutions and diversifying our investments 
in addition  our homebuilding operations often require us to obtain letters of credit 
in connection with the issuance of our senior secured first lien notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we terminated our revolving credit facility and refinanced the borrowing capacity thereunder 
in addition  we entered into certain stand alone letter of credit facilities  and agreements pursuant to which all of the outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility were replaced with letters of credit issued under such new letter of credit facilities and agreements 
however  we may need additional letters of credit above the amounts provided under these new letter of credit facilities and agreements 
if we are unable to obtain such additional letters of credit as needed to operate our business  we may be adversely affected 
weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes  tornadoes  earthquakes  floods  droughts  fires and other environmental conditions can harm the local homebuilding business 
our business in florida was adversely affected in late and into due to the affect of hurricane wilma on materials and labor availability and pricing 
conversely  hurricane ike  which hit houston in september  did not have an affect on materials and labor availability or pricing  but did affect the volume of home sales in subsequent weeks 
the difficulties described above could cause us to take longer and incur more costs to build our homes 
we may not be able to recapture increased costs by raising prices in many cases because we fix our prices up to months in advance of delivery by signing home sales contracts 
in addition  some home buyers may cancel or not honor their home sales contracts altogether 
the homebuilding industry is undergoing a significant and sustained downturn which has  and could continue to  materially and adversely affect our business  liquidity  and results of operations 
the homebuilding industry is now experiencing a significant and sustained downturn 
an industry wide softening of demand for new homes has resulted from a lack of consumer confidence  decreased availability of mortgage financing  and large supplies of resale and new home inventories  among other factors 
in addition  an oversupply of alternatives to new homes  such as rental properties  resale homes  and foreclosures  has depressed prices and reduced margins for the sale of new homes 
industry conditions had a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in fiscal years through and may continue to materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in fiscal further  we substantially increased our inventory through fiscal  which requi red significant cash outlays and which has increased our price and margin exposure as we continue to work through this inventory 
looking forward  if the housing market continues to deteriorate it will become more difficult to generate positive cash flow 
general economic conditions in the us remain weak 
market volatility has been unprecedented and extraordinary in the last several years  and the resulting economic turmoil may continue to exacerbate industry conditions or have other unforeseen consequences  leading to uncertainty about future conditions in the homebuilding industry 
continuation or worsening of this downturn or general economic conditions would continue to have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity  and results of operations 
in addition  an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages 
although substantially all of the mortgage loans we originate are sold in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released  non recourse basis  we remain liable for certain limited representations  such as fraud  and warranties related to loan sales 
as default rates rise  this may increase our potential exposure regarding mortgage loan sales because investors may seek to have us buy back or make whole investors for mortgages we previously sold 
to date  we have not made significant payments related to our mortgage loans but because of the uncertainties inherent to these matte rs  actual future payments could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts 
there can be no assurances that government responses to the disruptions in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence  stabilize the markets  or increase liquidity and the availability of credit  or whether any such results will be sustainable 
the housing market has benefited from a number of government programs  including tax credits for home buyers provided by the federal government and certain state governments  including california  and support of the mortgage market  including through purchases of mortgage backed securities by the federal reserve bank and the underwriting of a substantial amount of new mortgages by the federal housing administration fha and other governmental agencies 
these programs are expected to wind down over time  for example the california tax credit ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the federal tax credit expired in april in addition  in fiscal  the us department of housing and urban development hud tightened fha underwriting standards 
housing markets may further decline as these programs are modified or terminated 
leverage places burdens on our ability to comply with the terms of our indebtedness  may restrict our ability to operate  may prevent us from fulfilling our obligations  and may adversely affect our financial condition 
we have a significant amount of debt 
our debt  as of october   including the debt of the subsidiaries that guarantee our debt  was  million  million net of discount  and our debt service payments for the month period ended october   which include interest incurred and mandatory principal payments on our corporate debt under the terms of our indentures but which do not include principal and interest on nonrecourse secured debt  debt of our financial subsidiaries and fees under our letter of credit facilities and agreements  were million 
in addition  as of october   we had million in aggregate outstanding face amount of letters of credit issued under various letter of credit facilities and agreements  which were collateralized by million of cash 
our fees for these letters of credit for the months ended october   which are based on both the used and unused portion of the facilities and agreements  were million 
we also had substantial contractual commitments and contingent obligations  including approximately million of performance bonds as of october  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations 
our significant amount of debt could have important consequences 
for example  it could limit our ability to obtain future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  or other requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of our debt and reduce our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business  place us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt than some of our competitors  and make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business and general economic conditions 
our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend upon our future performance 
we are engaged in businesses that are substantially affected by changes in economic cycles 
our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve 
our businesses are also affected by customer sentiment and financial  political  business  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of equity securities  the refinancing of debt  or the sale of assets 
changes in prevailing interest rates may affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations to the extent we have any floating rate indebtednes s 
a higher interest rate on our debt service obligations could result in lower earnings or increased losses 
our sources of liquidity are limited and may not be sufficient to meet our needs 
in connection with the issuance of our senior secured first lien notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we terminated our revolving credit facility and refinanced the borrowing capacity thereunder 
because we no longer have a revolving credit facility  we are dependent on our current cash balance and future cash flows from operations which may not be positive to enable us to service our indebtedness  to cover our operating expenses  and or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity  which we may not be able to do on favorable terms or at all 
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our indebtedness  we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures  or to sell assets  seek additional capital  or restructure our indebtedness 
these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our debt service obligations 
we have also entered into certain cash collateralized letter of credit agreements and facilities that require us to maintain specified amounts of cash in segregated accounts as collateral to support our letters of credit issued thereunder  which will affect the amount of cash we have available for other uses 
if our available cash and capital resources are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations 
we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may restrict our ability to operate and if our financial performance worsens  we may not be able to undertake transactions within the restrictions of our debt instruments 
the indentures governing our outstanding debt securities impose certain restrictions on our operations and activities 
the most significant restrictions relate to debt incurrence  creating liens  sales of assets  cash distributions  including paying dividends on common and preferred stock  capital stock and debt repurchases  and investments by us and certain of our subsidiaries 
because of these restrictions  we are currently prohibited from paying dividends on our preferred stock and anticipate that we will remain prohibited for the foreseeable future 
the restrictions in our debt instruments could prohibit or restrict our activities such as undertaking capital raising or restructuring activities or entering into other transactions 
in such a situation  we may be unable to amend the instrument or obtain a waiver 
in addition  if we fail to make timely payments on this debt and other material indebtedness  our debt under these debt instruments could become due and payable prior to maturity 
in such a situation  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain alternative financing 
either situation could have a material adverse effect on the solvency of the company 
the terms of our debt instruments allow us to incur additional indebtedness 
under the terms of our indebtedness under our indentures  we have the ability  subject to our debt covenants  to incur additional amounts of debt 
the incurrence of additional indebtedness could magnify the risks described above 
in addition  certain obligations such as standby letters of credit and performance bonds issued in the ordinary course of business  including those issued under our stand alone letter of credit agreements and facilities  are not considered indebtedness under our indentures and may be secured  and therefore  are not subject to limits in our debt covenants 
we could be adversely affected by a negative change in our credit rating 
our ability to access capital on favorable terms is a key factor in our ability to service our indebtedness to cover our operating expenses  and to fund our other liquidity needs 
on march   fitch ratings lowered the company s issuer default rating to ccc from b 
on april   moody s investor services affirmed our corporate family rating of caa  with a negative outlook 
on april   standard poor s s p lowered our b corporate credit rating to ccc  with a negative outlook 
on september   s p affirmed our corporate credit rating of ccc but revised our outlook from developing to negative 
downgrades may make it more difficult and costly for us to access capital 
therefore  any further downgrade by any of the principal credi t agencies may exacerbate these difficulties 
our business is seasonal in nature and our quarterly operating results can fluctuate 
our quarterly operating results generally fluctuate by season 
historically  a large percentage of our agreements of sale have been entered into in the winter and spring 
the construction of a customer s home typically begins after signing the agreement of sale and can take months or more to complete 
weather related problems  typically in the fall  late winter and early spring  can delay starts or closings and increase costs and thus reduce profitability 
in addition  delays in opening communities could have an adverse affect on our sales and revenues 
due to these factors  our quarterly operating results will likely continue to fluctuate 
our success depends on the availability of suitable undeveloped land and improved lots at acceptable prices and our having sufficient liquidity to fund such investments 
our success in developing land and in building and selling homes depends in part upon the continued availability of suitable undeveloped land and improved lots at acceptable prices 
the availability of undeveloped land and improved lots for purchase at favorable prices depends on a number of factors outside of our control  including the risk of competitive over bidding on land and lots and restrictive governmental regulation 
should suitable land opportunities become less available  the number of homes we may be able to build and sell would be reduced  which would reduce revenue and profits 
in addition  our ability to make land purchases will depend upon us having sufficient liquidity to fund such purchases 
we may be at a disadvantage in competing for land due to our significant debt obli gations  which require substantial cash resources 
raw material and labor shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of home construction and adversely affect our operating results 
the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced raw material and labor shortages 
in particular  shortages and fluctuations in the price of lumber or in other important raw materials could result in delays in the start or completion of  or increase the cost of  developing one or more of our residential communities 
in addition  we contract with subcontractors to construct our homes 
therefore  the timing and quality of our construction depends on the availability  skill  and cost of our subcontractors 
delays or cost increases caused by shortages and price fluctuations could harm our operating results  the impact of which may be further affected depending on our ability to raise sales prices to offset increased costs 
changes in economic and market conditions could result in the sale of homes at a loss or holding land in inventory longer than planned  the cost of which can be significant 
land inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders 
we must continuously seek and make acquisitions of land for expansion into new markets and for replacement and expansion of land inventory within our current markets 
the market value of undeveloped land  buildable lots  and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic and market conditions 
in the event of significant changes in economic or market conditions  we may have to sell homes at a loss or hold land in inventory longer than planned 
in the case of land options  we could choose not to exercise them  in which case we would write off the value of these options 
inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market 
the assessment of commu nities for indication of impairment is performed quarterly 
while we consider available information to determine what we believe to be our best estimates as of the reporting period  these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances change 
see critical accounting policies 
for example  during   and  we decided not to exercise many option contracts and walked away from land option deposits and predevelopment costs  which resulted in land option write offs of million  million and million  respectively 
also  in   and  as a result of the difficult market conditions  we recorded inventory impairment losses on owned property of million  million  and million  respectively 
if market conditions continue to worsen  additional inventory impairment losses and land option write offs will likely be necessary 
home prices and sales activities in the california  maryland  new jersey  texas and virginia markets have a large impact on our results of operations because we conduct a significant portion of our business in these markets 
we presently conduct a significant portion of our business in the california  maryland  new jersey  texas and virginia markets 
home prices and sales activities in these markets and in most of the other markets in which we operate have declined from time to time  particularly as a result of slow economic growth 
in particular  market conditions in california  maryland  new jersey and virginia have declined significantly since the end of furthermore  precarious economic and budget situations at the state government level may adversely affect the market for our homes in those affected areas 
if home prices and sales activity decline in one or more of the markets in which we operate  our costs may not decline at all or at the same rate and may negatively impact our results of operations 
because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing  increases in interest rates or the decreased availability of mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes  lower demand for our products  limit our marketing effectiveness  and limit our ability to fully realize our backlog 
virtually all of our customers finance their acquisitions through lenders providing mortgage financing 
increases in interest rates or decreases in availability of mortgage financing could lower demand for new homes because of the increased monthly mortgage costs to potential home buyers 
even if potential customers do not need financing  changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their existing homes to potential buyers who need financing 
this could prevent or limit our ability to attract new customers as well as our ability to fully realize our backlog because our sales contracts generally include a financing contingency 
financing contingencies permit the customer to cancel its obligation in the event mortgage financing at prevailing intere st rates  including financing arranged or provided by us  is unobtainable within the period specified in the contract 
this contingency period is typically four to eight weeks following the date of execution of the sales contract 
starting in  many lenders have been significantly tightening their underwriting standards  and many subprime and other alternative mortgage products are no longer being made available in the marketplace 
if these trends continue and mortgage loans continue to be difficult to obtain  the ability and willingness of prospective buyers to finance home purchases or to sell their existing homes will be adversely affected  which will adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  we believe that the availability of mortgage financing  including federal national mortgage association  federal home loan mortgage corp  and fha va financing  is an important factor in marketing many of our homes 
in addition  in fiscal  hud tightened fha underwriting standards 
any limitations or restrictions on the availability of those types of financing could reduce our sales 
we conduct certain of our operations through unconsolidated joint ventures with independent third parties in which we do not have a controlling interest 
these investments involve risks and are highly illiquid 
we currently operate through a number of unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures with independent third parties in which we do not have a controlling interest 
at october   we had invested an aggregate of million in these joint ventures  including advances to these joint ventures of approximately million 
in addition  as part of our strategy  we intend to continue to evaluate additional joint venture opportunities 
these investments involve risks and are highly illiquid 
there are a limited number of sources willing to provide acquisition  development  and construction financing to land development and homebuilding joint ventures  and as market conditions become more challenging  it may be difficult or impossible to obtain financing for our joint ventures on commercially reasonable terms 
recently  we have been unable to obtain financing for newly created joint ventures 
in addition  we lack a controlling interest in these joint ventures and  therefore  are usually unable to require that our joint ventures sell assets or return invested capital  make additional capital contributions  or take any other action without the vote of at least one of our venture partners 
therefore  absent partner agreement  we will be unable to liquidate our joint venture investments to generate cash 
homebuilders are subject to a number of federal  local  state  and foreign laws and regulations concerning the development of land  the homebuilding  sales  and customer financing processes and protection of the environment  which can cause us to incur delays and costs associated with compliance and which can prohibit or restrict our activity in some regions or areas 
we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect the development and home building  sales  and customer financing processes  including zoning  density  building standards  and mortgage financing 
these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities 
this can delay or increase the cost of development or homebuilding 
in light of recent developments in the home building industry and the financial markets  federal  state  or local governments may seek to adopt regulations that limit or prohibit homebuilders from providing mortgage financing to their customers 
if adopted  any such regulations could adversely affect future revenues and earnings 
in addition  some state and local governments in markets where we operate have approved  and o thers may approve  slow growth or no growth initiatives that could negatively impact the availability of land and building opportunities within those areas 
approval of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to build and sell homes in the affected markets and or could require the satisfaction of additional administrative and regulatory requirements  which could result in slowing the progress or increasing the costs of our homebuilding operations in these markets 
any such delays or costs could have a negative effect on our future revenues and earnings 
we also are subject to a variety of local  state  federal  and foreign laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment 
the particular environmental laws that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site  the site s environmental conditions  and the present and former uses of the site 
these environmental laws may result in delays  may cause us to incur substantial compliance  remediation  and or other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity 
for example  as previously reported in the company s q for the quarters ended january   april   and july   the company was engaged in discussions with the u 
s 
environmental protection agency epa and the us department of justice doj regarding alleged violations of storm water discharge requirements 
in resolution of this matter  in april we agreed to the terms of a consent decree with the epa  doj and the states of virginia  maryland  west virginia and the district of columbia collectively the states 
the consent decree was approved by the federal district court in august under the terms of the consent decree  we have paid a fine of million collectively to the united states and the states named above and have agreed to perform under the terms of the consent decree for a minimum of three years  which includes implementing certain operational and training measures nationwide to facilitate ongoing compliance with storm water regulations 
we anticipate that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future 
although we cannot predict the effect of these requirements  they could result in time consuming and expensive compliance programs and in substantial expenditures  which could cause delays and increase our cost of operations 
in addition  the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as changes in policies  rules  and regulations and their interpretation and application 
product liability litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly 
as a homebuilder  we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
such claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly 
in addition  the amount and scope of coverage offered by insurance companies is currently limited  and this coverage may be further restricted and become more costly 
if we are not able to obtain adequate insurance against such claims  we may experience losses that could hurt our financial results 
our financial results could also be adversely affected if we were to experience an unusually high number of claims or unusually severe claims 
recently  other homebuilders in alabama  florida  louisiana  mississippi and texas have had construction defect claims associated with allegedly defective drywall manufactured in china chinese drywall that may be responsible for noxious smells and accelerated corrosion of certain metals in the home 
we have currently identified homes with chinese drywall that must be remediated  and we have been notified of more homes that potentially have chinese drywall that may need remediation 
these homes are located in our florida and houston markets 
the estimated costs of the remediations of these homes are reserved 
if additional homes are identified to have this issue  or our actual costs to remediate differ from our current estimated costs  it may require us to revise our warranty reserves 
we compete on several levels with homebuilders that may have greater sales and financial resources  which could hurt future earnings 
we compete not only for home buyers but also for desirable properties  financing  raw materials  and skilled labor often within larger subdivisions designed  planned  and developed by other homebuilders 
our competitors include other local  regional  and national homebuilders  some of which have greater sales and financial resources 
the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry together with current market conditions have  and could continue to  result in difficulty in acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices  increased selling incentives  lower sales  or delays in construction 
any of these problems could increase costs and or lower profit margins 
we may have difficulty in obtaining the additional financing required to operate and develop our business 
our operations require significant amounts of cash  and we may be required to seek additional capital  whether from sales of equity or borrowing additional money  for the future growth and development of our business 
the terms or availability of additional capital is uncertain 
moreover  the indentures for our outstanding debt securities contain provisions that restrict the debt we may incur in the future and our ability to pay dividends on equity 
if we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital  it could reduce our sales and may hinder our future growth and results of operations 
in addition  pledging substantially all of our assets to support our first  second and third lien senior secured notes may make it more difficult to raise additional financing in the future 
our future growth may include additional acquisitions of companies that may not be successfully integrated and may not achieve expected benefits 
acquisitions of companies have contributed to our historical growth and may again be a component of our growth strategy in the future 
in the future  we may acquire businesses  some of which may be significant 
as a result of acquisitions of companies  we may need to seek additional financing and integrate product lines  dispersed operations  and distinct corporate cultures 
these integration efforts may not succeed or may distract our management from operating our existing business 
additionally  we may not be able to enhance our earnings as a result of acquisitions 
our failure to successfully identify and manage future acquisitions could harm our operating results 
our controlling stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over us 
members of the hovnanian family  including ara k 
hovnanian  our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  have voting control  through personal holdings  the limited partnership established for members of mr 
hovnanian s family and family trusts  of class a and class b common stock that enables them to cast approximately of the votes that may be cast by the holders of our outstanding class a and class b common stock combined 
their combined stock ownership enables them to exert significant control over us  including power to control the election of the board and to approve matters presented to our stockholders 
this concentration of ownership may also make some transactions  including mergers or other changes in control  more difficult or impossible without their su pport 
also  because of their combined voting power  circumstances may occur in which their interests could be in conflict with the interests of other stakeholders 
our net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code 
based on recent impairments and our current financial performance  we generated a federal net operating loss carryforward of million through the year ended october   and we may generate net operating loss carryforwards in future years 
section of the internal revenue code contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change  which is generally any change in ownership of more than of its stock over a three year period  to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain built in losses recognized in years after the ownership change 
these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes among stockholders owning directly or indirectly or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company 
if we undergo an ownership change for purposes of section as a result of future transactions involving our common stock  including purchases or sales of stock between shareholders  our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and to recognize certain built in losses would be subject to the limitations of section depending on the resulting limitation  a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them 
our inability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in august  we announced that the board adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to preserve shareholder value and the value of certain tax assets primarily associated with net loss carryforwards and built in losses under section of the internal revenue code and on december   our stockholders approved the board s decision to adopt the shareholder rights plan 
in addition  on december   our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to restrict certain transfers of class a common stock in order to preserve the tax treatment of our net operating loss carryforwards and built in losses under section of the internal revenue code 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
utility shortages and outages or rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our operations 
in prior years  the areas in which we operate in california have experienced power shortages  including periods without electrical power  as well as significant fluctuations in utility costs 
we may incur additional costs and may not be able to complete construction on a timely basis if such power shortages outages and utility rate fluctuations continue 
furthermore  power shortages and outages  such as the blackout that occurred in in the northeast  and rate fluctuations may adversely affect the regional economies in which we operate  which may reduce demand for our homes 
our operations may be adversely affected if further rate fluctuations and or power shortages and outages occur in california  the northeast  or in our other markets 
geopolitical risks and market disruption could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
geopolitical events  such as the aftermath of the war with iraq and the continuing involvement in iraq and afghanistan  may have a substantial impact on the economy and the housing market 
the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september  had an impact on our business and the occurrence of similar events in the future cannot be ruled out 
the war and the continuing involvement in iraq and afghanistan  terrorism  and related geopolitical risks have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may have additional material adverse effects on the us economy  and our customers and  in turn  our results of operations and financial condition 
item b unresolved staff comments none 
item properties we own a  square foot office complex located in the northeast that serves as our corporate headquarters 
we own  square feet of office and warehouse space throughout the midwest 
we lease approximately  square feet of space for our segments located in the northeast  mid atlantic  midwest  southeast  southwest  and west 
included in this amount is  square feet of abandoned lease space 
item legal proceedings we are involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business  none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations  and we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect the development and home building  sales and customer financing processes  including zoning  density  building standards and mortgage financing 
these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities 
this can delay or increase the cost of development or homebuilding 
we also are subject to a variety of local  state  federal and foreign laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment 
the particular environmental laws that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site  the site s environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site 
these environmental laws may result in delays  may cause us to incur substantial compliance  remediation and or other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity 
as previously reported in the company s q for the quarters ended january   april  and july   the company was engaged in discussions with the u 
s 
environmental protection agency epa and the us department of justice doj regarding alleged violations of storm water discharge requirements 
in resolution of this matter  in april we agreed to the terms of a consent decree with the epa  doj and the states of virginia  maryland  west virginia and the district of columbia collectively the states 
the consent decree was approved by the federal district court in august under the terms of the consent decree  we have paid a fine of million collectively to the united states and the states and have agreed to perform under the terms of the consent d ecree for a minimum of three years  which includes implementing certain operational and training measures nationwide to facilitate ongoing compliance with storm water regulations 
we anticipate that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future 
although we cannot predict the effect of these requirements  they could result in time consuming and expensive compliance programs and in substantial expenditures  which could cause delays and increase our cost of operations 
in addition  the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as changes in policies  rules  and regulations and their interpretations and application 
the company is also involved in the following litigation a subsidiary of the company has been named as a defendant in a purported class action suit filed on may  in the united states district court for the middle district of florida  randolph sewell  et al  v 
d allesandro woodyard  et al  alleging violations of the federal securities acts  among other allegations  in connection with the sale of some of the subsidiary s homes in fort myers  florida 
plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on october  plaintiffs sought to represent a class of certain home purchasers in southwestern florida and sought damages  rescission of certain purchase agreements  restitution of out of pocket expenses  and attorneys fees and costs 
the company s subsid iary filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on december  following oral argument on the motion in september  the court dismissed the amended complaint with leave for plaintiffs to amend 
plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on october  the company s subsidiary filed a motion to dismiss this second amended complaint 
the court dismissed portions of the second amended complaint 
the court dismissed additional portions of the second amended complaint on april  we have had negotiations with the plaintiffs recently to settle this case 
based on these negotiations we have accrued an immaterial amount for the potential settlement based on our assessment of the outcome 
however  our assessment of the potential outcome may differ from the ultimate resolution of this matter

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning during the second half of our fiscal year ended october   the us housing market has been impacted by declining consumer confidence  increasing home foreclosure rates and large supplies of resale and new home inventories 
the result has been weakened demand for new homes  slower sales  higher than normal cancellation rates and increased price discounts and other sales incentives to attract homebuyers 
additionally  the availability of certain mortgage financing products became more constrained starting in february when the mortgage industry began to more closely scrutinize subprime  alt a  and other nonprime mortgage products  and over the past few years  many lenders have significantly tightened their underwriting standards 
the overall economy has weakened signific antly and fears of further prolonged economic weakness are still present due to high unemployment levels  further deterioration in consumer confidence and the reduction in extensions of credit and consumer spending 
as a result  we experienced significant decreases in our revenues and gross margins during   and compared with prior years 
during  the homebuilding market exhibited a large degree of choppiness 
signs of this choppiness can be seen in key measures  such as our gross margin  cancellation rates and total deliveries each quarter in we continued to see declines in deliveries and revenues during fiscal  however  our gross margin percentage increased to for the year ended october  from for the year ended october   and our contract cancellation rates of and in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal is consistent with more normalized levels  as seen in fiscal and however  ou r cancellation rate as a percentage of backlog was for the fourth quarter which is the highest it has been in the last six quarters 
active selling communities increased by compared with the same period a year ago and net contracts per active selling community decreased slightly to for the year ended october  compared to in the same period in the prior year 
although we remain cautiously optimistic  several challenges such as persistently high unemployment levels  the expiration of the federal homebuyers tax credit on april  and the threat of more foreclosures continue to hinder a recovery in the housing market 
we have exposure to additional impairments of our inventories  which  as of october   have a book value of billion  net of million of impairments recorded on of our communities 
we also have million invested in  lots under option  including cash and letters of credit option deposits of million as of october  we will record a write off for the amounts associated with an option if we determine it is probable we will not exercise it 
as of october   we have total investments in  and advances to  unconsolidated joint ventures of million 
each of our joint ventures assesses its inventory and other long lived assets for impairment and we separately assess our investment in joint ventures for other than temporary declines  which has resulted in total reductions in our investment in joint ventures of million from the second half of fiscal  the first quarter in which we had impairments on our joint ventures  through october  we still have exposure to future write downs of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures if conditions continue to deteriorate in the markets in which our joint ventures operate 
with respect to goodwill and intangibles  there is no remaining risk of further exposure to impairments because both goodwill and finite lived intangibles were fully written off as of october  as the market for new homes declined  we adjusted our approach to land acquisition and construction practices and shortened our land pipeline  reduced production volumes  and balanced home price and profitability with sales pace 
we delayed and cancelled planned land purchases and renegotiated land prices and significantly reduced our total number of controlled lots owned and under option 
additionally  we significantly reduced our total number of speculative homes put into production over the past several years 
recently  however  we have begun to see more opportunities to purchase land at prices that make economic sense in light of the current sales prices and sales paces and have been pursuing such land acquisitions 
new land purchases at prici ng that will generate good investment returns and drive greater operating efficiencies are needed to return to profitability 
during fiscal  we increased our controlled lots by  and we opened new communities 
during fiscal  we purchased approximately  lots within newly identified communities defined as communities controlled subsequent to january  
in addition  we optioned approximately  lots in newly identified communities during the fourth quarter of in the third quarter of fiscal compared to the second quarter of fiscal  we had an increase in active selling communities in consecutive quarters 
this was the first consecutive quarter increase in active selling community count since the second quarter of fiscal continuing this trend  we had an increase in active selling communities in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the third quarter of fiscal we have also c ontinued to closely evaluate and make reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses  including corporate general and administrative expenses  reducing these expenses million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due in large part to a reduction in head count at the end of fiscal from our peak in june given the persistence of these difficult market conditions  improving the efficiency of our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to be a significant area of focus 
for the year ended october   homebuilding selling  general and administrative costs declined to million compared to the year ended october  critical accounting policies management believes that the following critical accounting policies require its most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements income recognition from home and land sales we are primarily engaged in the development  construction  marketing and sale of residential single family and multi family homes where the planned construction cycle is less than months 
for these homes  in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment real estate sales asc  revenue is recognized when title is conveyed to the buyer  adequate initial and continuing investments have been received  and there is no continued involvement 
in situations where the buyer s financing is originated by our mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial investment or continuing investment as prescribed by asc  the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale o f the related mortgage loan to a third party investor has been completed 
additionally  in certain markets  we sell lots to customers  transferring title  collecting proceeds  and entering into contracts to build homes on these lots 
in these cases  we do not recognize the revenue from the lot sale until we deliver the completed home and have no continued involvement related to that home 
the cash received on the lot is recorded as a reduction of inventory until the revenue is recognized 
income recognition from mortgage loans our financial services segment originates mortgages  primarily for our homebuilding customers 
we use mandatory investor commitments and forward sales of mortgage backed securities mbs to hedge our mortgage related interest rate exposure on agency and government loans 
we elected the fair value option for our loans held for sale for mortgage loans originated subsequent to october  in accordance with asc  financial instruments  which permits us to measure our loans held for sale at fair value 
management believes that the election of the fair value option for loans held for sale improves financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring the fair value of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
in addition  we recognize the fair value of our rights to service a mortgage loan as revenue upon entering into an interest rate lock loan commitment with a borrower 
the fair value of these servicing rights is in cluded in loans held for sale 
fair value of the servicing rights is determined based on values in the company s servicing sales contracts 
substantially all of the mortgage loans originated are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released  nonrecourse basis although the company remains liable for certain limited representations  such as fraud  and warranties related to loan sales 
mortgage investors could seek to have us buy back loans or make whole investors for mortgages we have sold 
to date  we have not made significant payments associated with our loans and we have reserves for potential losses 
included in mortgage loans held for sale at october  is million of mortgage loans  which represent loans that cannot currently be sold at reasonable terms in the secondary mortgage market 
these loans are serviced by a third party until such time that they can be liquidated via alternative mortgage markets  foreclosure or repayment 
inventories inventories consist of land  land development  home construction costs  capitalized interest and construction overhead 
construction costs are accumulated during the period of construction and charged to cost of sales under specific identification methods 
land  land development  and common facility costs are allocated based on buildable acres to product types within each community  then charged to cost of sales equally based upon the number of homes to be constructed in each product type 
we record inventories in our consolidated balance sheets at cost unless the inventory is determined to be impaired  in which case the inventory is written down to its fair value 
our inventories consist of the following three components sold and unsold homes and lots under development  which includes all construction  land  capitalized interest  and land development costs related to started homes and land under development in our active communities  land and land options held for future development or sale  which includes all costs related to land in our communities in planning or mothballed communities  and consolidated inventory not owned  which includes all costs related to specific performance options  variable interest entities  and other options  which cons ists primarily of our model homes and inventory related to structured lot options 
we have decided to mothball or stop development on certain communities where we have determined the current market conditions do not justify further investment at this time 
when we decide to mothball a community  the inventory is reclassified from sold and unsold homes and lots under development to land and land options held for future development or sale 
as of october   the book value of the mothballed communities was million  net of impairment charges of million 
we regularly review communities to determine if mothballing is appropriate or to re activate previously mothballed communities as we did with communities in the twelve months ended october  the recoverability of inventories and other long lived assets are assessed in accordance with the provisions of asc  property  plant and equipment overall asc 
asc requires long lived assets  including inventories  held for development to be evaluated for impairment based on undiscounted future cash flows of the assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
as such  we evaluate inventories for impairment at the individual community level  the lowest level of discrete cash flows that we measure 
we evaluate inventories of communities under development and held for future development for impairment when indicators of potential impairment are present 
indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  decreases in local housing market values  decreases in gross margins or sales absorption rates  decreases in net sales prices base sales price net of sales incentives  or actual or projected operating or cash flow losses 
the assessment of communities for indication of impairment is performed quarterly  primarily by completing detailed budgets for all of our communities and identifying those communities with a projected operating loss for any projected fiscal year or for the entire projected community life 
for those communities with projected losses  we estimate the remaining undiscounted future cash flows and compare those to the carrying value of the community  to determine if the carrying value of the asset is recoverable 
the projected operating profits  losses  or cash flows of each community can be significantly impacted by our estimates of the following future base selling prices  future home sales incentives  future home construction and land development costs  and future sales absorption pace and cancellation rates 
these estimates are dependent upon specific market conditions for each community 
while we consider available information to determine what we believe to be our best estimates as of the end of a quarterly reporting period  these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances change 
local market specific conditions that may impact our estimates for a community include the intensity of competition within a market  including available home sales prices and home sales incentives offered by our competitors  the current sales absorption pace for both our communities and competitor communities  community specific attributes  such as location  availability of lots in the market  desirability and uniqueness of our community  and the size and style of homes currently being offered  potential for alternative product offerings to respond to local market conditions  changes by management in the sales strategy of the community  and current local market economic and demographic conditions and related trends and forecasts 
these and other local market specific conditions that may be present are considered by management in preparing projection assumptions for each community 
the sales objectives can differ between our communities  even within a given market 
for example  facts and circumstances in a given community may lead us to price our homes with the objective of yielding a higher sales absorption pace  while facts and circumstances in another community may lead us to price our homes to minimize deterioration in our gross margins  although it may result in a slower sales absorption pace 
in addition  the key assumptions included in our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows may be interrelated 
for example  a decrease in estimated base sales price or an increase in homes sales incentives may result in a corresponding increase in sales absorption pace 
additionally  a decrease in the average sales price of homes to be sold and closed in future reporting periods for one community that has not been generating what management believes to be an adequate sales absorption pace may impact the estimated cash flow assumptions of a nearby community 
changes in our key assumptions  including estimated construction and development costs  absorption pace and selling strategies  could materially impact future cash flow and fair value estimates 
due to the number of possible scenarios that would result from various changes in these factors  we do not believe it is possible to develop a sensitivity analysis with a level of precision that would be meaningful 
if the undiscounted cash flows are more than the carrying value of the community  then the carrying amount is recoverable  and no impairment adjustment is required 
however  if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount  then the community is deemed impaired and is written down to its fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of each community by determining the present value of its estimated future cash flows at a discount rate commensurate with the risk of the respective community 
our discount rates used for all impairments recorded from october  to date range from to 
the estimated future cash flow assumptions are virtually the same for both our recoverability and fair value assessments 
should the estimates or expectations used in determin ing estimated cash flows or fair value  including discount rates  decrease or differ from current estimates in the future  we may be required to recognize additional impairments related to current and future communities 
the impairment of a community is allocated to each lot on a relative fair value basis 
from time to time  we write off deposits and approval  engineering and capitalized interest costs when we determine that it is no longer probable that we will exercise options to buy land in specific locations or when we redesign communities and or abandon certain engineering costs 
in deciding not to exercise a land option  we take into consideration changes in market conditions  the timing of required land takedowns  the willingness of land sellers to modify terms of the land option contract including timing of land takedowns  and the availability and best use of our capital  among other factors 
the write off is recorded in the period it is deemed probable that the optioned property will not be acquired 
in certain instances  we have been able to recover deposits and other pre acquisit ion costs that were previously written off 
these recoveries have not been significant in comparison to the total costs written off 
inventories held for sale  which are land parcels where we have decided not to build homes  represented million of our total inventories at october   and are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in determining whether land held for sale is impaired  management considers  among other things  prices for land in recent comparable sale transactions  market analysis studies  which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land other than in a forced liquidation sale and recent bona fide offers received from outside third parties 
insurance deductible reserves for homes delivered in fiscal and  our deductible under our general liability insurance is million per occurrence for construction defect and warranty claims 
for bodily injury claims  our deductible per occurrence in is million up to a million limit 
for bodily injury claims in  our deductible was million 
our aggregate retention in and is million for construction defect and warranty claims  and million for bodily injury claims 
we do not have a deductible on our worker s compensation insurance in fiscal for fiscal  our worker s compensation insurance deductible was million per occurrence 
reserves for estimated losses for fiscal and have been established using the assistance of a third party actuary 
we engage a third party actuary that uses our historical warranty data and other industry data to assist our management to estimate our unpaid claims  claim adjustment expenses and incurred but not reported claims reserves for the risks that we are assuming under the general liability and worker s compensation programs 
the estimates include provisions for inflation  claims handling and legal fees 
these estimates are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build  claim settlement patterns  insurance industry practices  and legal interpretations  among others 
because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated liability amounts  actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts 
land options costs incurred to obtain options to acquire improved or unimproved home sites are capitalized 
such amounts are either included as part of the purchase price if the land is acquired or charged to operations if we determine we will not exercise the option 
if the options are with variable interest entities and we are the primary beneficiary  we record the land under option on the consolidated balance sheets under consolidated inventory not owned with an offset under liabilities from inventory not owned 
the evaluation of whether or not we are the primary beneficiary can require significant judgment 
similarly  if the option obligation is to purchase under specific performance or has terms that require us to record it as financing  then we record the option on the consolidated balance sheets under consolidated inventory not owned with an offset under liabilities from inventory not owned 
in accordance with asc  consolidation overall asc  we record costs associated with other options on the consolidated balance sheets under land and land options held for future development or sale 
unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures investments in unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  we recognize our proportionate share of earnings and losses earned by the joint venture upon the delivery of lots or homes to third parties 
our ownership interest in joint ventures varies but is generally less than or equal to 
in determining whether or not we must consolidate joint ventures where we are the managing member of the joint venture  we assess whether the other partners have specific rights to overcome the presumption of control by us as the manager of the joint venture 
in most cases  the presumption is overcome because the joint venture agre ements require that both partners agree on establishing the significant operating and capital decisions of the partnership  including budgets  in the ordinary course of business 
the evaluation of whether or not we control a venture can require significant judgment 
in accordance with asc  investments equity method and joint ventures overall asc  we assess our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for recoverability  and if it is determined that a loss in value of the investment below its carrying amount is other than temporary  we write down the investment to its fair value 
we evaluate our equity investments for impairment based on the joint venture s projected cash flows 
this process requires significant management judgment and estimate 
during fiscal and  we wrote down certain joint venture investments by million and million  respectively 
there were no write downs in fiscal post development completion and warranty costs in those instances where a development is substantially completed and sold and we have additional construction work to be incurred  an estimated liability is provided to cover the cost of such work 
in addition  we estimate and accrue warranty costs as part of cost of sales for repair costs under  per occurrence to homes  community amenities and land development infrastructure 
in addition  we accrue for warranty costs over  per occurrence as part of our general liability insurance deductible expensed as selling  general  and administrative costs 
warranty accruals require our management to make significant estimates about the cost of future claims 
both of these liabilities are recorded in accounts payab le and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes deferred income taxes or income tax benefits are provided for temporary differences between amounts recorded for financial reporting and for income tax purposes 
if the combination of future years income or loss combined with the reversal of the timing differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried back to prior years or carried forward to future years to recover the deferred tax assets 
in accordance with asc  income taxes overall asc  we evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required 
asc requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely t han not standard 
see total taxes below under results of operations for further discussion of the valuation allowances 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc  and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a liability that is materially different from our current estimate 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
there have been no accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented that we believe will materially impact our financial statements 
capital resources and liquidity our operations consist primarily of residential housing development and sales in the northeast new jersey  new york  pennsylvania  the midwest illinois  kentucky  minnesota  ohio  the mid atlantic delaware  maryland  virginia  west virginia  washington dc  the southeast florida  georgia  north carolina  south carolina  the southwest arizona  texas  and the west california 
in addition  we provide financial services to our homebuilding customers 
we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt and equity securities 
in light of the challenging homebuilding market conditions experienced over the past few years  which are continuing as reflected in our decline in revenues during the twelve months ended october   compared to the same period of  we had been operating with a primary focus to generate cash flows from operations through reductions in assets 
the generation of cash flow  together with debt repurchases and exchanges at prices below par  has allowed us to reduce net debt debt less cash over the past two years 
however  recently we have begun to see more opportunities to purchase land at prices that make economic sense given current home sales prices and sales paces 
as such  in we have acquired new land at higher levels than in the previous few years 
as a result  our net debt increased slightly in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal compared to the first half of fiscal our cash uses during the months ended october  and were for operating expenses  land purchases  land deposits  construction spending  state income taxes  interest and debt principal payments and repurchases 
we provided for our cash requirements from available cash on hand  housing and land sales  financial service revenues  a federal tax refund and other revenues 
we believe that these sources of cash will be sufficient through fiscal to finance our working capital requirements and other needs  despite continued declines in total revenues  the termination of our revolving credit facility in fiscal and the collateralization with cash in segregated accounts to support certain of our letters of credit 
we may also enter into land sale agreements or joint ventures to generate cash from our existing balance sheet 
due to a change in tax legislation that became effective on november   allowing a carryback of our net operating loss five years to previously profitable years  we were able to file for a million federal income tax refund and we received million of that refund during our second quarter of fiscal and received the remaining amount in the first quarter of fiscal our homebuilding cash balance at october  decreased by million from october  this decrease was impacted by million for principal payments upon debt maturity and debt repurchases  and million for new land purchases  offset by increases of million from the federal income tax refund  million of cash previously reported as restricted cash which is no longer required to collateralize our letter of credit agreements and facilities  and increases in cash from operating activities 
our net income loss historically does not approximate cash flow from operating activities 
the difference between net income loss and cash flow from operating activities is primarily caused by changes in inventory levels together with changes in receivables  prepaid and other assets  interest and other accrued liabilities  deferred income taxes  accounts payable  mortgage loans and liabilities  and noncash charges relating to depreciation  amortization of computer software costs  amortization of finite lived intangibles  stock compensation awards and impairment losses for inventory  finite lived intangibles and goodwill 
when we are expanding our operations  inventory levels  prepaids  and other assets increase causing cash flow from operating activities to decrease 
certain liabilities also increase as operations expand and partially offset the negative effect on cash flow from operations caused by the increase in inventory levels  prepaids and other assets 
similarly  as our mortgage operations expand  net income from these operations increases  but for cash flow purposes net income is offset by the net change in mortgage assets and liabilities 
the opposite is true as our investment in new land purchases and development of new communities decrease  which is what was happening since the last half of fiscal through part of fiscal  allowing us to generate positive cash flow from operations during this period 
in the latter part of fiscal and continuing in fiscal  we began to grow our community count again and as a result of the new land purchases and land development we used cash in operations 
looking forward  given the depressed housing market  it will become more difficult to generate positive cash flow from operations until we return to profitability 
however  we wi ll continue to make adjustments to our structure and our business plans in order to maximize our liquidity while also taking steps to return to profitability  including through land acquisition 
we continue to focus on maximizing cash flow by limiting our investment in currently owned communities that we believe will not generate positive cash flow in the near term  and by seeking to identify and purchase new land parcels primarily finished lots on which homes can be built and delivered in a short period of time  generating acceptable returns  based on our underwriting standards  and positive cash flow 
on july   our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up to million shares of class a common stock 
as of october   million shares of class a common stock have been purchased under this program see part ii  item for information on equity purchases 
we did not buy back any shares under this program during fiscal  or on july   we issued  shares of series a preferred stock  with a liquidation preference of  dividends on the series a preferred stock are not cumulative and are payable at an annual rate of 
the series a preferred stock is not convertible into the company s common stock and is redeemable in whole or in part at our option at the liquidation preference of the shares beginning on the fifth anniversary of their issuance 
the series a preferred stock is traded as depositary shares  with each depositary share representing th of a share of series a preferred stock 
the depositary shares are listed on the nasdaq global market under the symbol h ovnp 
in each of fiscal year and  we paid million of dividends on the series a preferred stock 
in fiscal  and  we did not make any dividend payments as a result of covenant restrictions in our debt instruments 
we anticipate that we will continue to be restricted from paying dividends  which are not cumulative  for the foreseeable future 
on may   we issued  shares of class a common stock for net proceeds of million 
in connection with the issuance of our senior secured first lien notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we terminated our revolving credit facility and refinanced the borrowing capacity thereunder 
also in connection with the refinancing  we entered into certain stand alone cash collateralized letter of credit agreements and facilities under which there were a total of million and million of letters of credit outstanding as of october  and october   respectively  which is reflected in restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
these agreements and facilities require us to maintain specified amounts of cash as collateral in segregated accounts to support the letters of credit issued thereunder  which will affect the amount of cash we have available for other uses 
as of october  and october   the amount of cash collateral in these segregated accounts was million and million  respectively

the indentures governing the senior secured  senior  and senior subordinated notes do not contain any financial maintenance covenants but do contain restrictive covenants that limit  among other things  the company s ability and that of certain of its subsidiaries  including k 
hovnanian  the issuer of the senior secured  senior  and senior subordinated notes  to incur additional indebtedness other than certain permitted indebte dness  refinancing indebtedness and nonrecourse indebtedness  pay dividends and make distributions on common and preferred stock  repurchase senior and senior subordinated notes with respect to the senior secured first lien notes indenture  make other restricted payments  make investments  sell certain assets  incur liens  consolidate  merge  sell  or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets and enter into certain transactions with affiliates 
the indentures also contain events of default which would permit the holders of the senior secured  senior  and senior subordinated notes to declare those notes to be immediately due and payable if not cured within applicable grace periods  including the failure to make timely payments on the notes or other material indebtedness  the failure to comply with agreements and covenants and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency and  with respect to the indentures governing the senior secured notes  the failure of the documents granting security for the senior secured notes to be in full force and effect and the failure of the liens on any material portion of the collateral securing the senior secured notes to be valid and perfected 
as of october   we believe we were in compliance with the covenants of the indentures governing our outstanding notes 
under the terms of the indentures  we have the right to make certain redemptions and  depending on market conditions and covenant restrictions  may do so from time to time 
we also continue to evaluate our capital structure and may continue to make debt purchases and or exchanges from time to time  through tender offers  open market purchases  private transactions  or otherwise  or seek to raise additional debt or equity capital  depending on market conditions and covenant restrictions 
if our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the indentures governing our senior secured  senior and senior subordinated notes  is less than to  we are restricted from making certain payments  including dividends  and from incurring indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness  refinancing indebtedness and nonrecourse indebtedness 
as a result of this restriction  we are currently restricted from paying dividends  which are not cumulative  on our series a preferred stock 
if current market trends continue or worsen  we will continue to be restricted from paying dividends for the foreseeable future 
our inability to pay dividends is in accordance with covenant restrictions and will not result in a default under our b ond indentures or otherwise affect compliance with any of the covenants contained in the bond indentures

downgrades in our credit ratings do not accelerate the scheduled maturity dates of our debt or affect the interest rates charged on any of our debt issues or our debt covenant requirements or cause any other operating issue 
the only potential risk from negative changes in our credit ratings is that they may make it more difficult or costly for us to access capital

total inventory decreased million  excluding inventory not owned  during the year ended october  total inventory  excluding inventory not owned  for fiscal decreased in the northeast million  in the mid atlantic million  in the midwest million  which decreases were offset by increases in the southeast million  in the southwest million  and in the west million 
during fiscal  we incurred million in write downs primarily attributable to impairments as a result of a continued decline in sales pace  sales price and general market conditions 
in addition  we wrote off costs in the amount of million during fiscal  related to land options that expired or that we terminated 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional information 
despite these write downs and inventory reductions due to deliveries  total inventory only decreased million  excluding inventory not owned  because we purchased million of land during fiscal we have recently been able to identify new land parcels at prices that we believe will generate reasonable returns under current homebuilding market conditions 
substantially all homes under construction or completed and included in inventory at october  are expected to be closed during the next months 
most inventory completed or under development was is partially financed through our line of credit and debt and equity issuances 
the total inventory decreases discussed above excluded the decrease in consolidated inventory not owned of million consisting of specific performance options  options with variable interest entities  and other options that were added to our balance sheet in accordance with asc  debt product financing arrangements  and asc  leases sales leaseback transactions  and variable interest entities in accordance with asc see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional information on asc specific performance options inventory decreased million for the year ended october  this decrease was primarily due to the fact that certain lots previously recorded as a future obligation in the northeast were taken down during the first quarter of fiscal variable interest entity options inventory decreased million as we continue to take down land or walk away from deals previously consolidated under asc other options inventory decreased million for the year ended october  other options consist of inventory financed via a model home program and structured lot option agreements 
model home inventory financed through the model lease program decreased million because we have terminated the use of models in certain communities where models were no longer needed and in conjunction therewith also terminated the option to purchase those models 
structured lot option inventory decreased million 
this decrease was primarily in the mid atlantic where we walked away from a land purchase transaction during the first quarter of fiscal we usually option property for development prior to acquisition 
by optioning property  we are only subject to the loss of the cost of the option and predevelopment costs if we choose not to exercise the option 
as a result  our commitment for major land acquisitions is reduced 
our inventory representing land and land options held for future development or sale at october   on the consolidated balance sheets  decreased by million compared to october  the decrease is due to additional impairments taken in the northeast and the west in fiscal  offset by an increase due to the acquisition of new land in the southeast  southwest and west segments as land prices became more attractive during fiscal included in land and land options held for future development or sale inventory are amounts associated with inventory in mothballed communities 
we mothball or stop development on certain communities when we determine the current performance does not justify further investment at this time 
that is  we believe we will generate higher returns if we avoid spending money to improve land today and save the raw land until such times as the markets improve 
as of october   we have mothballed land in communities 
the book value associated with these communities at october  was million  net of impairment charges of million 
we continually review communities to determine if mothballing is appropriate or to re activate previously mothballed communities as we did with communities in the twelve months ended october  the following table summarizes home sites included in our total residential real estate 
the increase in total home sites available in compared to is attributable to the new communities that have been controlled via option or purchased during  partially offset by delivering homes in existing communities

investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million during the fiscal year ended october  the decrease is primarily due to distributions received from joint ventures during fiscal this is partially offset by increases resulting from additional investments in joint ventures 
as of october   we have investments in eight homebuilding joint ventures and five land development joint ventures 
other than guarantees limited only to completion of development  environmental indemnification and standard indemnification for fraud and misrepresentation including voluntary bankruptcy  we have no guarantees associated with unconsolidated joint ventures 
receivables  deposits and notes increased million since october  to million at october  the increase is primarily due to a note receivable that is secured by land  as well as an increase in receivables for home closings as a result of cash in transit from various title companies at the end of the respective periods 
property  plant and equipment decreased million during the twelve months ended october  primarily due to depreciation and a small amount of disposals  which were offset by minor additions for leasehold improvements during the period 
prepaid expenses and other assets were as follows as of in thousands october  october  dollar change prepaid insurance prepaid project costs senior residential rental properties other prepaids other assets total prepaid insurance decreased due to the timing of payments for insurance premium costs and related amortization of these costs  as they are amortized over the life of the associated insurance policy  which can be one to three years 
prepaid project costs decreased for homes delivered faster than by spending on new communities 
prepaid project costs consist of community specific expenditures that are used over the life of the community 
such prepaids are expensed as homes are delivered 
other prepaids decreased mainly due to the amortization of the remaining prepaid debt costs 
also contributing to the decrease were debt repurchases during fiscal  which resulted in the write off of portions of the associated prepaid debt costs 
financial services mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of residential mortgages receivable held for sale of which million and million at october  and october   respectively  were being temporarily warehoused and are awaiting sale in the secondary mortgage market 
also included are residential mortgages receivable held for sale of million and million at october  and october   respectively  which represent loans that cannot currently be sold at reasonable terms in the secondary mortgage market 
we may incur losses with respect to mortgages that were previously sold that are delinquent  but only to the extent the losses are not covered by mortgage insurance or resale value of the house 
historically  we have incurred minimal credit losses 
the increase in mortgage loans held for sale from october  is a result of an increase in the time it has taken for loan purchasers to process and settle the loans  which we believe is due to more rigorous pre funding reviews implemented by the industry 
nonrecourse land mortgages were million at october  and zero at october  the increase is due to two new purchase money mortgages for properties in our southwest and west segments during fiscal accounts payable and other liabilities are as follows as of in thousands october  october  dollar change accounts payable reserves accrued expenses accrued compensation other liabilities total the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the lower volume of deliveries in the fourth quarter of compared to the prior year 
the increase in the reserves is the result of an accrual for a letter of credit related to an option walk away that will be funded in fiscal and also for increased legal reserves related to post development completion in the northeast and west 
the decrease in accrued expenses is due to the amortization of abandoned lease space accruals  along with a decrease for property taxes accrued at october  compared to october  the increase in accrued compensation is due to increased bonus payments for associates in certain markets that generated profits in fiscal  along with severance accruals in the northeast and mid atlantic markets  and also a change from quarterly to annual bonus payments in one of our markets in the southwest  where a full year s bonus is accrued at october  compared to only one quarter s bonus at october  the decrease in other liabilities is primarily due to the payoff of a note in the first quarter of fiscal associated with a community in the northeast 
customer deposits decreased to million at october  from million at october  the decrease was primarily due to lower contracts in backlog and the impact of the use of a third party escrow agent to hold deposits in the northeast 
mortgage warehouse line of credit under our secured master repurchase agreements increased million from million at october   to million at october  the increase is directly correlated to the increase in mortgage loans held for sale from october  to october  liabilities from inventory not owned decreased million to million at october  from million at october  because inventory not owned decreased as discussed previously

average price per home also decreased to  for from  in and from  in  as a result of price declines and geographic community mix of our deliveries

myers  florida division in the first quarter of fiscal the decrease in housing revenues during the years ended october  and october  was primarily due to the continued weak market conditions in most of our markets

in our homebuilding segments  homes delivered decreased     and in the northeast  mid atlantic  midwest  southeast  southwest and west  respectively 
another reason for reduced sales in was hr  enacted into law in  which includes the american housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act of among other provisions  this law eliminated seller funded down payment assistance on fha insured loans approved on or after october  of our total home closings utilizing k 
hovnanian mortgage for the mortgage loans in fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  approximately and  respectively  were funded with mortgage loans whereby the homebuyer used a seller financed down payment assistance program 
these programs were ended during the first quarter of fiscal  which resulted in none of our homebuyers utilizing them after the first quarter of fiscal  this issue was partially mitigated by federal government purchases of fha va loans and the increase in loan limits for these types of loans 
quarterly housing revenues and net sales contracts by segment  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  for the years ending october   and are set forth below quarter ended in thousands october  july  april  january  housing revenues northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total sales contracts net of cancellations northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total quarter ended in thousands october  july  april  january  housing revenues northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total sales contracts net of cancellations northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total quarter ended in thousands october  july  april  january  housing revenues northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total sales contracts net of cancellations northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total our reported level of sales contracts net of cancellations has been impacted by a slowdown in the pace of sales in all of the company s segments  due to weakening market conditions and tighter mortgage loan underwriting criteria 
contracts per average active selling community in were compared to fiscal of  demonstrating a decrease in sales pace 
cancellation rates represent the number of cancelled contracts in the quarter divided by the number of gross sales contracts executed in the quarter 
for comparison  the following are historical cancellation rates  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures 
quarter first second third fourth another common and meaningful way to analyze our cancellation trends is to compare the number of contract cancellations as a percentage of the beginning backlog 
the following table provides this historical comparison  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures 
quarter first second third fourth historically  most cancellations occur within the legal rescission period  which varies by state but is generally less than two weeks after the signing of the contract 
cancellations also occur as a result of a buyer s failure to qualify for a mortgage  which generally occurs during the first few weeks after signing 
however  beginning in fiscal year  we have been experiencing higher than normal numbers of cancellations later in the construction process 
these cancellations are related primarily to falling prices  sometimes due to new discounts offered by us and other builders  leading the buyer to lose confidence in their contract price and due to tighter mortgage underwriting criteria leading to some customers inability to be approved for a mortgage loan 
in some cases  the buyer will walk away from a significant nonrefundable deposit that we recognize as other revenues 
while our cancellation rate based on gross sales contracts since the second quarter of fiscal has been lower than it has been for several years  and closer to more normalized levels  it is difficult to predict if this trend will continue 
however  for the fourth quarter of fiscal  the cancellation rate as a percentage of beginning backlog increased compared to other fiscal periods and is higher than historical periods 
an important indicator of our future results is recently signed contracts and our home contract backlog for future deliveries 
our consolidated contract backlog  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures using base sales prices by segment is set forth below dollars in thousands october  october  october  northeast total contract backlog number of homes mid atlantic total contract backlog number of homes midwest total contract backlog number of homes southeast total contract backlog number of homes southwest total contract backlog number of homes west total contract backlog number of homes totals total consolidated contract backlog number of homes the decline in our backlog for the years ended october  and october  is a direct result of a fall off in our contract pace 
our net contracts for the full years of fiscal and  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  declined and  respectively 
in the month of november  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  we signed an additional net contracts amounting to million in contract value 
cost of sales includes expenses for consolidated housing and land and lot sales  including inventory impairment loss and land option write offs defined as land charges in the tables below 
a breakout of such expenses for consolidated housing sales and housing gross margin is set forth below year ended dollars in thousands october  october  october  sale of homes cost of sales  net of impairment reversals and excluding interest expense homebuilding gross margin  before cost of sales interest expense and land charges cost of sales interest expense  excluding land sales interest expense homebuilding gross margin  after cost of sales interest expense  before land charges land charges homebuilding gross margin  after cost of sales interest expense and land charges gross margin percentage  before cost of sales interest expense and land charges gross margin percentage  after cost of sales interest expense  before land charges gross margin percentage after cost of sales interest expense and land charges cost of sales expenses as a percentage of consolidated home sales revenues are presented below year ended october  october  october  sale of homes cost of sales  net of impairment reversals and excluding interest housing  land and development costs commissions financing concessions overheads total cost of sales  before interest expense and land charges gross margin percentage  before cost of sales interest expense and land charges cost of sales interest gross margin percentage  after cost of sales interest expense and before land charges we sell a variety of home types in various communities  each yielding a different gross margin 
as a result  depending on the mix of communities delivering homes  consolidated gross margin may fluctuate up or down 
total homebuilding gross margins  before interest expense and land impairment and option write off charges increased to for the year ended october  compared to for the same period last year 
the declining pace of sales in our markets in   and has led to intense competition in many of our specific community locations 
in order to attempt to maintain a reasonable pace of absorption  we have increased incentives  reduced lot location premiums  as well as lowered some base prices  all of which have impacted our margins significantly and resulted in s ignificant inventory impairments 
however  the rate of the decline has slowed in most of our segments and in a few locations we have been able to raise prices without adversely impacting sales pace 
in addition  during fiscal we delivered the final homes in some older communities where margins were lower and in fiscal we have increased the number of deliveries from new communities where we have acquired the land at more reasonable prices  resulting in higher gross margins 
also  we have recorded impairment reversals as homes previously impaired are delivered 
this has resulted in the improvement in our gross margins before cost of sales interest and land charges 
reflected as inventory impairment loss and land option write offs in cost of sales land charges  we have written off or written down certain inventories totaling million  million  and million during the years ended october    and  respectively  to their estimated fair value 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for an additional discussion 
during the years ended october    and  we wrote off residential land options and approval and engineering costs amounting to million  million  and million  respectively  which are included in the total write offs mentioned above 
when a community is redesigned  abandoned engineering costs are written off 
option  approval and engineering costs are written off when a community s pro forma profitability is not projected to produce adequate returns on the investment commensurate with the risk and we believe it is probable we will cancel the option 
such write offs were located in all of our segments 
the inventory impairments amounting to million  million  and million for the years ending october   and  respectively  were incurred because of continued downward pressure on prices in order to maintain sales pace in many of our markets 
in  the majority of the impairments were in the northeast and west segments 
impairments in the northeast were primarily due to communities now classified as held for sale and thus adjusted to fair value 
in the west  where we have significant competition from foreclosures  we have had to continue to reduce prices in order to maintain sales pace 
this is especially true in some of the more fringe markets in ou r west segment 
inventory impairments were lower than they have been in several years  as we have begun to see some stabilization in prices and sales pace in some of our segments 
it is difficult to predict if this trend will continue  and should it become necessary to further lower prices  or should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated cash flows or fair value decrease or differ from current estimates in the future  we may need to recognize additional impairments 
below is a break down of our lot option walk aways and impairments by segment for fiscal in  in total  we walked away from of all the lots we controlled under option contracts 
the remaining of our option lots are in communities that remain economically feasible  including a substantial number that were successfully renegotiated in the past few years 
the following table represents lot option walk aways by segment for the year ended october  in millions dollar amount of walk away number of walk away lots of walk away lots total option lots walk away lots as a of total option lots northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west total includes lots optioned at october  and lots optioned that the company walked away from in the year ended october  the following table represents impairments by segment for the year ended october  in millions dollar amount of impairment of impairments pre impairment value of pre impairment value northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west total homebuilding selling  general  and administrative sga expenses decreased to million for the year ended october   and decreased to million for the year ended october  from million for the year ended october  these decreases in sga expenses are the result of reduced costs through headcount reduction  administrative consolidation and other cost saving measures 
land sales and other revenues land sales and other revenues consist primarily of land and lot sales

profits from land sales for the year ended october  were less than for the year ended october  although we budget land sales  they are often dependent upon receiving approvals and entitlements  the timing of which can be uncertain 
as a result  projecting the amount and timing of land sales is difficult 
there were several larger land sales in the prior year compared to only a few in the current year  which resulted in the significant decrease of land sales revenue 
land sales and other revenues decreased million and million for the years ended october  and october   respectively 
other revenues include income from contract cancellations  where the deposit has been forfeited due to contract terminations  interest income  cash discounts  buyer walk aways and miscellaneous one time receipts 
in fiscal  the primary reason for the decrease in other revenue by million was a reduction in interest income due to lower excess cash in interest bearing accounts as well as lower interest rates in compared to in addition  as cancellation rates have come down during the year  income from forfeited customer deposits has declined

financial services financial services consist primarily of originating mortgages from our homebuyers  selling such mortgages in the secondary market  and title insurance activities 
we use mandatory investor commitments and forward sales of mortgage backed securities mbs to hedge our mortgage related interest rate exposure on agency and government loans 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk 
credit risk associated with mbs forward commitments and loan sales transactions is managed by limiting our counterparties to investment banks  federally regulated bank affiliates and other investors meeting our credit standards 
our risk  in the event of default by the purchaser  is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the mbs forwa rd commitments 
in an effort to reduce our exposure to the marketability and disposal of nonagency and nongovernmental loans  including alt a fico scores below and depending on credit criteria and sub prime loans fico scores below and depending on credit criteria  we require our financial services segment to either presell or broker all of these loans  on an individual loan basis as soon as they are committed to by the customer 
however  because of tightening standards by mortgage lenders  none of the loans we originated during fiscal and were alt a or sub prime as compared to of our originated loans being alt a loans and of our originated loans being sub prime loans for fiscal as alt a and sub prime originations declined  we have seen an increase in our level of federal housing administration and veterans administration fha va loan origination 
for the years ended october   and  fha va loans represented   and  respecti vely  of our total loans 
profits and losses relating to the sale of mortgage loans are recognized when legal control passes to the buyer of the mortgage and the sales price is collected 
during the years ended october    and  financial services provided an million  million  and million pretax profit  respectively 
in fiscal  financial services revenue decreased million to million due to a decrease in the number of mortgage settlements offset by a slight increase in the average loan amount 
in fiscal  we recorded expense of million for abandoned lease space  which contributed to the increase in pretax profit from october  to october   as this expense did not recur in revenues from october  to october  decreased million to million consistent with our reduction in mortgage settlements and the decrease in the average loan amount 
in the market areas serve d by our wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiaries  approximately   and of our noncash homebuyers obtained mortgages originated by these subsidiaries during the years ended october    and  respectively 
servicing rights on new mortgages originated by us will be sold with the loans 
corporate general and administrative corporate general and administrative expenses include the operations at our headquarters in red bank  new jersey 
these expenses include payroll  stock compensation  facility and other costs associated with our executive offices  information services  human resources  corporate accounting  training  treasury  process redesign  internal audit  construction services  and administration of insurance  quality  and safety 
corporate general and administrative expenses declined million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october   and declined million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  the reduction in expenses in fiscal was primarily due to the expense of million taken in fi scal for the cancellation of stock options  which did not recur in fiscal during fiscal  the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  each of the nonexecutive members of the board of directors and certain other senior executives of the company consented to the cancellation of certain of their options with the full understanding that the company made no commitment to provide them with any other form of consideration in respect of the cancelled options in order to reduce a portion of the equity reserve overhang under the company s equity compensation plans represented by the number of shares of the company s common stock remaining available for future issuance under such plans including shares that may be issued upon the exercise or vesting of outstanding options and other rights 
the million charge to operations was a noncash charge that increased paid in capital by the same amount 
excluding this option cancellation expense  corporate  general and administrative expenses decreased million and million for the year ended october  compared to october  and october  compared to october   respectively 
these decreases are primarily due to reduced salaries resulting from headcount reduction and continued tightening of variable spending 
other interest other interest increased million to million for the year ended october  for fiscal  other interest increased million to million 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  our assets that qualify for interest capitalization inventory under development no longer exceed our debt  and therefore a portion of interest not covered by qualifying assets must be directly expensed 
as our inventory balances have continued to decrease  the amount of interest required to be directly expensed has increased 
other operations other operations consist primarily of miscellaneous residential housing operations expenses  senior rental residential property operations  rent expense for commercial office space  amortization of prepaid bond fees  minority interest relating to consolidated joint ventures  and corporate owned life insurance 
compared to the previous year  other operations decreased million to million for the year ended october   and increased million to million for the year ended october  the decrease in other operations from october  to october  is primarily due to an million accrual for abandoned commercial lease space that occurred in fiscal and did not recur in fiscal this expense was offset by income of million du e to the reversal of an accrual related to litigation in the fourth quarter of fiscal  when it was determined that payment was no longer probable 
these two items  which were recorded in  were also the cause for the increase in other operations from october  to october  goodwill and intangible amortization and impairments we amortized our finite lived intangibles over their expected useful life  ranging from one to four years 
at the end of fiscal year  we wrote off all of our remaining intangible assets 
as a result  there was no amortization or other expense in fiscal and in fiscal  this expense includes the impairment of the remaining million balance of finite lived intangibles and million of goodwill 
gain on extinguishment of debt during the year ended october   we repurchased in the open market a total of million principal amount of various issues of our unsecured senior and senior subordinated notes due through for an aggregate purchase price of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we recognized a gain of million net of the write off of unamortized discounts and fees related to these purchases  which represents the difference between the aggregate principal amounts of the notes purchased and the total purchase price 
during the year ended october   we repurchased in the open market a total of million principal amount of various issues of our unsecured senior and senior subordinated notes due through for an aggregate purchase price of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we recognized a gain of million net of the write off of unamortized discounts and fees  related to these purchases  which represents the difference between the aggregate principal amounts of the notes purchased and the total purchase price 
in addition  on december   we exchanged a total of million principal amount of various issues of our unsecured senior notes due through for million in senior secured notes due this exchange resulted in a recognized gain of million 
during the year ended october   we completed cash tender offers whereby we purchased an aggregate of approximately million principal amount of various issues of our secured and unsecured senior and senior subordinated notes due through for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  plus accrued unpaid interest 
as a result of the tender offers we recognized a gain of million in the third quarter of fiscal  net of the write off of unamortized discounts and fees and a loss of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the fourth quarter loss was offset by gains from open market repurchases resulting in a net loss of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal we may continue to make additional debt purchases and or exchanges through tender offers  open market purchases  private transactions or otherwise from time to time depending on market conditions and covenant restrictions 
income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures consists of our share of the earnings or losses of the joint venture 
the loss decreased million to income of million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  the income in is mainly due to our two newest joint ventures that have been delivering homes and reporting profits during fiscal we also recognized income from one of our land development joint ventures that sold a parcel of land for a profit 
our loss increased million from the year ended october  to a loss of million for the year ended october  the increased loss in was mainly due to the write down of our investment in one of our joint ventures where the full investment was determined to be impaired  as well as for our share of the losses from inventory impairments from two other joint ventures 
these losses were offset by the fact that we are no longer recording any loss related to a fourth joint venture because we wrote off our investment in that joint venture in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and have no further funding commitments to this entity 
total taxes the total income tax benefit was million for the twelve months ended october   primarily due to the benefit recognized for a federal net operating loss carryback 
on november   president obama signed the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  under which the company was able to carryback its net operating loss five years to previously profitable years that were not available to the company for carryback prior to this tax legislation 
we recorded the benefit for the carryback of million in the first quarter of fiscal the remaining tax benefit for the twelve months ended october  was primarily due to the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions where the statute of limitation s for those items has lapsed 
we received million of the federal income tax refund in the second quarter of and we received the remaining million in the first quarter of fiscal deferred federal and state income tax assets primarily represent the deferred tax benefits arising from temporary differences between book and tax income which will be recognized in future years as an offset against future taxable income 
if the combination of future years income or loss and the reversal of the timing differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried forward to future years to recover the deferred tax assets 
in accordance with asc  we evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required 
asc requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
given the c ontinued downturn in the homebuilding industry during  and  resulting in additional inventory and intangible impairments  we are in a three year cumulative loss position as of october  according to asc  a three year cumulative loss is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
our valuation allowance for current and deferred taxes amounted to million and at october  and  respectively 
the valuation allowance decreased during the twelve months ended october  primarily due to the impact of the federal net operating loss carryback recorded in the first quarter of  partially offset by additional reserves recorded for the federal tax benefits for the losses incurred during fiscal the valuation allowance increased during the twelve months ended october  to reserve for the tax benefit created by the losses during fiscal off balance sheet financing in the ordinary course of business  we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes 
lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development 
at october   we had million in option deposits in cash and letters of credit to purchase land and lots with a total purchase price of million 
our liability is generally limited to forfeiture of the nonrefundable deposits  letters of credit and other nonrefundable amounts incurred 
we have no material third party guarantees 
however  million of the million in land and lot option purchase contracts contain specific performance clauses which require us to purchase the land or lots upon satisfaction of certain requirements by both the sellers and the company 
therefore  this specific performance obligation of million  which is the purchase price for these lots net of cash deposits already paid  is recorded on the balance sheet in liabilities from inventory not owned 
pursuant to asc  consolidation asc  we consolidated million of inventory not owned at october   representing the fair value of the optioned property 
additionally  to reflect the fair value of the inventory consolidated under asc  we eliminated million of its related cash deposits for lot option contracts  which are included in consolidated inventory not owned 
since we do not own an equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities vie that we must consolidate pursuant to asc  we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners 
when our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers  certain assumpt ions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required 
in most cases  the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities has been based on the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing 
in these cases  it is assumed that the entities have funded the acquisition of the property with debt and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset for the assumed third party financing of the variable interest entity 
at october   we had cash deposits and letters of credit totaling million  representing our current maximum exposure associated with the consolidation of lot option contracts 
creditors of these vies  if any  have no recourse against us 
in addition  see note to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure related to our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our aggregate contractual commitments at october  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total represents our senior secured  senior  and senior subordinated notes  other notes payable and related interest payments for the life of the debt of million 
interest on variable rate obligations is based on rates effective as of october  represents obligations under option contracts with specific performance provisions  net of cash deposits 
total contractual obligations exclude our accrual for uncertain tax positions recorded for financial reporting purposes as of october  because we were unable to make reasonable estimates as to the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
does not include the mortgage warehouse lines of credit made under our secured master repurchase agreements 
we had outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds of approximately million and million  respectively  at october   related principally to our obligations to local governments to construct roads and other improvements in various developments 
we do not believe that any such letters of credit or bonds are likely to be drawn upon 
inflation inflation has a long term effect  because increasing costs of land  materials  and labor result in increasing sale prices of our homes 
in general  these price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in our housing markets and have not had a significant adverse effect on the sale of our homes 
a significant risk faced by the housing industry generally is that rising house construction costs  including land and interest costs  will substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers 
inflation has a lesser short term effect  because we generally negotiate fixed price contracts with many  but not all  of our subcontractors and material suppliers for the construction of our homes 
these prices usually are applicable for a specified number of residential buildings or for a time period of between three to twelve months 
construction costs for residential buildings represent approximately of our homebuilding cost of sales

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a primary market risk facing us is interest rate risk on our long term debt 
in connection with our mortgage operations  mortgage loans held for sale  and the associated mortgage warehouse lines of credit under our secured master repurchase agreements are subject to interest rate risk  however  such obligations reprice frequently and are short term in duration 
in addition  we hedge the interest rate risk on mortgage loans by obtaining forward commitments from private investors 
accordingly  the risk from mortgage loans is not material 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk except with respect to mortgage loans 
we are also subject to foreign currency risk but we do not believe this risk is material
