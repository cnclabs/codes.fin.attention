overview we develop and distribute software and hosted solutions  and provide associated services  for individuals and business users to securely exchange information over the internet and within other network environments 
our software is used worldwide across a wide range of industries  including us and foreign government organizations 
through the end of  we had distributed over million software licenses to our customer base which includes individual consumers  small to medium sized businesses  and some of the largest corporations in the world  including of the fortune our solution portfolio facilitates delivery of critical information such as financial data  medical records  customer files and other similar documents while supporting a range of information protection approaches to meet privacy and other security requirements 
in addition  these solutions ensure compliance with government regulations relating to the protection of information while allowing users to reduce it costs  increase efficiency  track and audit transactions and automate processes 
our products also provide data replication  acceleration of file transfer  sharing collaboration and continuous data backup and recovery to our customers 
we believe that we are strongly positioned to provide secure transfer  sharing  and replication of files that need to be transmitted inside the user s firewall to distributed offices  or outside the user s firewall to business and trading partners 

table of contents our initial product  cuteftp  a file transfer protocol client program used mostly by individuals and small business  was first distributed in over the internet and has achieved significant success and popularity 
we built on this success by steadily adding complementary products  such as the standard and enterprise versions of our enhanced file transfer server software  and establishing an internal sales organization and reseller distribution network 
our capabilities have evolved from personal and server based file transfer software to include managed e mail attachment and software as a service  or saas  information sharing solutions 
we have also developed wide area file services wafs  and continuous data protection cdp software which further enhance the ability to share and backup files within the infrastructure of a company s wide and local area networks wan and lan  at wan and lan speeds 
we believe the secure information exchange aspects of our mft products provide a basis for us to address customer needs in adjacent markets such as business to business bb  data loss prevention  and endpoint security where our mft solutions may be directly applicable or interoperate with other products offered by partners  acquired by globalscape  or developed internally 
the following is a brief description of our products and solutions file management products our file management products are best known for the cuteftp product line 
they primarily consist of products that help users securely move and copy files on the internet 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from licensing our file management products 
some of our products encrypt the transfers for security using technology similar to a web browser 
the products consist of three product categories  client  server and compression transfer 
our file management product line includes enhanced file transfer eft server  cuteftp pro  cuteftp home  and cuteftp lite 
wide area file services and continuous data protection products our wafs products provide a file sharing  collaboration  and replication solution over multiple sites 
by keeping all data updated on each location s file server  each site has instant access to the very latest version 
wafs guarantees total file concurrency across multiple servers deployed around the world 
changes made to data on any server are mirrored on all other servers 
wafs efficiently utilizes network bandwidth by intelligently communicating only compressed and encrypted file changes between locations 
wafs technology can have cdp added to it to provide enterprises with a file access and data protection combination that centralizes data storage and it administration facilities but doesn t compromise data sharing and protection 
as files change  file servers backup in real time to the customer s backup site which can be at the same or a remote location 
the backup server can keep any number of past versions of each file and deleted files which gives the customer immediate restore  as well as the ability to perform point in time snapshots 
managed e mail attachment solutions our managed e mail attachment solution  mail express  addresses the needs of businesses that prefer to use their legacy e mail infrastructure to deliver and manage e mail attachments 
e mail traditionally has been ill suited to delivery of certain attachments due to typical infrastructure and administrator defined limitations on e mail attachment size 
in many cases  these limitations preclude sending or receiving e mail attachments larger than even or mb 
the mail express solution allows delivery of multi gb files as e mail attachments by seamlessly replacing the attachments with links to the files 
this approach can ease the load on the e mail infrastructure and the long term storage requirements associated with e mail attachments 
mail express also allows enhanced tracking and auditing of the file attachments through read receipts and log files 
software as a service solution our saas solution  cutesendit  is a file transfer service for individuals  professionals  and businesses 
cutesendit uses cloud computing approaches to deliver files through a hosted web portal 
this solution approach meets the needs of users who do not have  or wish to invest in  file transfer infrastructure such as ftp servers or even client application software 
users access the cutesendit application over the internet using a standard web browser  securely upload files up to multi gb through the portal  and compose a brief message to accompany the file delivery 
cutesendit 
table of contents then sends the message to the recipients as the body of an e mail message 
this e mail message also includes links to the files uploaded through the cutesendit web portal 
anyone with an internet connection can access this service at www 
cutesendit 
com 
there is no software to install with cutesendit and no specific knowledge of file transfer is needed to use it 
cutesendit currently is free to use for a limited number of transfers  and offers various monthly and yearly fee based plans that meet specific file transfer requirements 
endpoint security endpoint security solutions include antivirus  anti spyware  application whitelisting  data and file encryption  and other product categories 
whitelisting is a relatively new entrant into this security market 
unlike traditional blacklisting solutions which rely on detecting and defeating millions of malicious software applications and unique malware executables  whitelisting allows users to lock servers  personal computers  and other devices into a known  trusted state and allows only approved applications to run 
in december  we announced a strategic investment in coretrace corporation  a privately held software company based in austin  texas 
coretrace develops and sells a leading enterprise application whitelisting solution  bouncer by coretrace 
in  we entered into a reseller agreement with coretrace for this product 
outlook we believe that the future success of our business will be dependent upon our ability to continue enhancing our file transfer products  expand into adjacent markets  increase our market visibility and recognition  and increase government sales 
continue enhancing and developing our existing solutions products 
our future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products  product upgrades  and services on a timely basis 
we have in the past incurred  and we believe that we will continue to incur  significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive 
innovation  new product development  and go to market activities involve a significant commitment of time and resources and are subject to a number of risks and challenges 
expand our solution portfolio 
the company s primary market is for managed file transfer products which according to gartner is a million per year market which is growing to year over year 
this market is significantly smaller than potential adjacent markets 
however  our entry into such markets will require that we effectively define and then develop  acquire  or partner for viable solutions applicable to these markets 
we also must market  sell  and support these solutions effectively 
each of these success factors has inherent risks due to  for example  our limited corporate expertise in the adjacent markets and the possibility that the specific buyers of solutions in these adjacent markets may be different from the buyers with whom we interact throughout our current mft sales cycle 
in addition  entry into these markets will require investments that may adversely impact our financial results 
we intend to continue using strategic partnerships or acquisitions as necessary to further enhance our solution portfolio  expand our sales channels  and enter adjacent markets 
for example  during  we announced a partnership with carahsoft technology corporation  a government it solutions provider with headquarters in reston  virginia 
carahsoft added globalscape s solutions to its general services administration gsa schedule and provided proactive sales and marketing support to drive demand for globalscape s solutions within the federal  state  and local government markets 
with the carahsoft partnership  government wide customers can order globalscape solutions directly from the carahsoft gsa schedule or through the gsa advantage online shopping and ordering system 
our largest single contract in  a million order from the us army  was processed using the carahsoft gsa schedule 
other partnerships announced in included intelligent decisions  inc  nubridges  and multiple small business program registrations 

table of contents in december  we announced a strategic investment in coretrace corporation  a privately held software company based in austin  texas 
coretrace develops and sells a leading enterprise application whitelisting solution  bouncer by coretrace and  in  we entered into a reseller agreement with coretrace  under which we will resell the bouncer solution 
increase our name recognition 
in order to grow our business  we believe that we must increase the recognition of globalscape as a provider of secure information exchange solutions 
we have continued to increase our market visibility through marketing communication activities such as press releases and media outreach 
we also have achieved substantial market recognition  in the form of certifications  validations  and analyst ranking  for our continued development of secure information exchange solutions 
for example  we have received federal information processing standards fips validation of the globalscape cryptographic module embedded in enhanced file transfer server 
enhanced file transfer server version and the latest version of cuteftp pro also received the certificate of networthiness con from the us army network technology command netcom during our receipt of this certificate enables army installations worldwide to install and operate these server and client based secure information exchange solutions 
overall  we have a very strong combination of capabilities which led to gartner s retaining globalscape in the market leader quadrant of the magic quadrant for managed file transfer during we believe our solutions will continue to provide the best value for businesses seeking to establish or enhance their secure information exchange capabilities 
we received other significant recognition during  in addition to analyst ranking and technical certifications and validations 
we were named to deloitte s technology fast  a ranking that recognizes the fastest growing technology  media  telecommunications  life sciences and clean technology companies in north america on the basis of five year revenue growth 
we also were ranked among the top workplaces in san antonio for by the san antonio express news 
the full list and ranking were noted in the express news special edition top workplaces publication on october  the companies were selected on the basis of a comprehensive analysis conducted by workplace dynamics  llc  in a survey of employees throughout san antonio 
qualities measured include company leadership  compensation and training  workplace flexibility  and diversity 
in addition  we received a technology superstar award from the satai network  a technology acceleration and commercialization foundation based in san antonio 
the annual technology superstar award recognizes companies that are poised to become leaders in the south texas technology community 
increase government sales 
sales to the us government have become an important aspect of our business 
government contracts typically have a long sales cycle and the funding of our programs is subject to the overall us government budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors  including geo political events and macroeconomic conditions  and are beyond our control 
in addition  us government contracts generally also permit the government to terminate the contract  in whole or in part  without prior notice  at the government s convenience or for default based on performance 
we intend to increase our government sales by leveraging our presence with the department of defense  expanding the number of our channel partners such as carahsoft and by positioning the company to work with large system integrators 
we also will continue to seek additional sales to federal agencies which are required to meet small business administration goals 
under sba auspices  of government business is set aside for small business concerns  like globalscape  as defined by government specified size standards 
access capital markets 
our primary sources of capital have been cash flow from operations and cash on hand 
however  if an acquisition or other opportunity requiring a significant capital investment were to arise  we would likely be required to seek capital from external sources such as a commercial bank or other lender or the sale of debt or equity securities 
we cannot assure you that such external capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  in the event such capital were debt  we would be required to utilize a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service and would also likely be required to comply with financial covenants which could limit our ability to continue to grow our business 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company has a strong working capital position resulting from net profits from operations over of the last quarters 
at december   our net working capital position was approximately million 
we had cash available of million and we continue to generate cash from operating activities 
we rely on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to fund our operations 
our capital requirements principally relate to our need to enhance our existing products and to develop new products  which primarily consist of research and development expenses and expenses for people and the elements that support their work 
by comparison  we do not spend large sums on capital equipment 
over the past three years  we spent  in   in and  in for equipment 
capital expenditures were higher in primarily as a result of the move to new office space in san antonio 
because our principal sources of capital are cash on hand and cash flow from operations  to the extent that sales decline  our cash flow from operations will also decline 
if sales decline or if our liquidity is otherwise under duress  management could substantially reduce personnel and personnel related costs  reduce or substantially eliminate capital expenditures and or reduce or substantially eliminate research and development expenditures 
we may also sell equity or debt securities or enter into credit arrangements in order to finance future acquisitions or licensing activities  to the extent available 
net cash provided by operating activities was   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in was largely due to an increase in net income and an increase in deferred revenue associated with pre paid maintenance and support contracts 
the company received a large order from the us army in april  which included a three year pre paid contract for maintenance and support 
significant non cash add backs in include the goodwill and long lived asset impairment  offset by a large non cash decrease in deferred taxes 
the remainder of the change in cash provided by operating activities was due to increases in deferred revenues  deferred compensation and a decrease in federal income tax receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in our investing activities in was due to an investment of  in coretrace  a  net investment in short term certificates of deposit  and  which was used for additional furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements as renovations were made to our office 
in and  cash used in investing activities was used for additional furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements as we moved into a new office 
our financing activities over the past three years have primarily related to the repurchase of shares of our common stock  funding the acquisition of availl  and proceeds received from the exercise of stock options 
the cash provided during was from the exercise of stock options 
we used our own cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock  in the amount of  and  in and  respectively 
in  we repaid the remaining million of the million term loan used to purchase availl from the cash generated from our operations and a stock offering completed in november at december   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases as well as royalty agreements with third parties  federal income tax and trade accounts payable 
the commitments related to royalty agreements are contingent on sales volumes 
we plan to continue to expend significant resources on product development in future periods and may also use our cash to acquire or license technology  intellectual property  products or businesses related to our current business strategy 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   consisting of future minimum payments under operating leases payments due by fiscal year and thereafter total contractual obligations building lease equipment leases new accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its guidance regarding the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
this guidance requires that hardware components of a tangible product containing software components always be excluded from the software revenue recognition 
this guidance also provides information on how to allocate consideration to deliverables in an arrangement that includes both tangible products and software 
this guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb amended its guidance regarding revenue recognition on multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance amends the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance also establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vsoe if available  third party evidence if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
this amendment also replaces the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant 
this guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the guidance also requires the best estimate of selling price be determined in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis 
finally  this guidance significantly expands the disclosures related to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we have not yet evaluated the effect of the adoption of this guidance on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  impairment of goodwill  impairment of long lived assets  accounting for research and development costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for income taxes  and accounting for stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable 
in making these judgments  we evaluate these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider a non cancelable written agreement signed by us and the customer to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement 

table of contents delivery has occurred 
we consider delivery to have occurred when a compact disc or other medium containing the licensed software is provided to a common carrier or in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given electronic access to the licensed software 
if an arrangement includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 
fixed or determinable fee 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within normal payment terms 
if the fee is subject to refund or adjustment  we recognize revenue when the refund or adjustment right lapses or the return is estimable 
for arrangements with extended payment terms  we recognize revenue as amounts become due and payable or as cash is collected 
we grant a limited right of return to our customers 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review for all transactions at the inception of an arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if  based upon our evaluation  we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  revenue is deferred and recognized upon cash collection 
in arrangements that include multiple elements  including perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services  and packaged products with content updates  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of the undelivered elements  and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue 
our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance  consumer product support  and arrangements where vsoe does not exist 
deferred revenue totaled approximately million as of december   of which approximately million was classified as other long term liabilities in the balance sheets 
vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately 
we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements 
when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance  then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period 
while the above noted accounting standards govern the basis for revenue recognition  judgment and the use of estimates are required in connection with the allocation of revenue between software license revenue and maintenance and support revenue  as well as the amount of deferred revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill 
we assess goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite life for impairment within our reporting units annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
a two step impairment test is to be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the equity assigned to that unit  goodwill is not considered to be impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the equity assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of that reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess 
to determine the reporting units fair value in the current year evaluation  we use the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit 
our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs  growth rates and other relevant factors 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there 
table of contents are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our goodwill could change significantly 
such change could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 
in  during the performance of our annual impairment test and in conjunction with our budgeting process a review of the projected future sales of our wafs cdp products showed a significant decrease in expected future revenues 
this decrease was a significant contributing factor in the goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
in december  the company performed its annual impairment analysis 
for this analysis  we estimated the fair value of goodwill using the discounted cash flows methodology 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment were the projected results of operations  weighted average cost of capital wacc  working capital requirements  and terminal value assumptions 
this analysis required the input of several critical assumptions including future growth rates  cash flow projections  wacc  rate of return  and terminal value assumptions 
the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company s capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital 
the results of the analysis show a carrying value of  as of december   compared to a fair value of  the fair value exceeds the carrying value by less than  however given the recent stabilization of product sales and our plans for the product  we did not believe that further analysis was required and did not perform the second step of the impairment test 
thus no impairment was recorded as of december  intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of other identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of long lived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many triggering factors which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition 
the availl purchase largely gained us rights to software  the value of the software on our books and goodwill are linked 
therefore the same analysis of future sales that led us to determine there was a goodwill impairment also led to an impairment of the acquired asset 
during fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million primarily for the write down of identified intangible assets related to the availl acquisition 
in december  the company performed its annual impairment analysis and determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets did not exceed the implied fair value and therefore no impairment charge was recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly assess the collectability of outstanding customer invoices and  in so doing  we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the non collection of customer receivables 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current creditworthiness  customer concentration  age of the receivable balance  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates and exceed our related loss allowance 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by measuring the fair value of the award at the grant date and recognizing expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends and measuring volatility 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

table of contents income taxes we recognize taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events in our financial statements 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  including uncertain tax positions and the realizability of deferred tax assets  which is dependent on the timing of the underlying deductions and the company s ability to generate future taxable income 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

we derive our revenues primarily from software sales 
revenue is comprised of the gross selling price of software  including shipping charges and the earned portion of maintenance and support agreements 
revenues increased from  in to  in the increase of approximately  or in revenues was largely due to the sale to the us army in april and increased sales of maintenance and support 
the following table reflects revenue by product including the related maintenance and support for each product revenue for the year ended december  product eft server enterprise eft server cuteftp professional cuteftp home wide area file services continuous data protection all others deferred revenue adjustment total revenues maintenance and support net of deferred revenues 
table of contents sales of our eft server and eft server enterprise products increased by  to million in from million in this increase in revenue was primarily attributable to several factors a sale to the us army for  units of the eft server software  with fips certified libraries and our ssh module plus related maintenance and support for a total contribution of million to revenue  an increase in eft server enterprise and eft server maintenance and support sales and an increase in units sold 
with the release of eft server in march of  customers were able to purchase additional individual add on modules 
with this new flexibility  customers of the lower end eft server product were able to purchase modules which were not available in the legacy secure ftp server solution 
the company also released the advanced workflow engine awe module in february  which contributed to the increase in unit sales 
in total  our eft server and eft server enterprise products represented approximately of our total revenues in as compared to in  before adjusting for deferred revenues 
revenues from cuteftp decreased by from million in to million in and accounted for approximately of total revenues in  before adjusting for deferred revenues  and in this decline continues the general reduction in cuteftp product revenues  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues  experienced since the consumer ftp product market has substantial low cost  and even free  solutions that have put increasing pressure on cuteftp product revenues 
additional pressure on this product line comes from social media companies and services that allow consumers to share images and video 
in addition  we believe the economic downturn has also reduced the spending capability of our customers 
while we are continuing development of cuteftp products  our reliance on these products likely will continue to decline 
wide area file services and continuous data protection product revenues decreased by from million in to million in and accounted for approximately and of total revenues in  before adjusting for deferred revenues  and  respectively 
the wide area file services and continuous data protection products are largely used by architecture  engineering and construction firms to transfer large documents between offices 
these firms have been significantly affected by the economic recession  and as a result sales of wide area file services and continuous data protection software decreased drastically at the beginning of the year as companies cut discretionary spending 
with some recovery in the economy and the release of wide area file services version in june  sales stabilized over the second half of the year 
because of the more complex nature of the eft server  eft server enterprise  wide area file services and continuous data protection products  purchasers of those products require increased maintenance and support 
our maintenance and support revenues increased by from  in to  in approximately  of the increase in maintenance and support revenue was related to the sale to the us army in april which will continue into in addition  maintenance and support revenues increased due to an increase in sales support staff dedicated to selling maintenance and support renewals 
as our enterprise products become a larger portion of our total revenues  maintenance and support revenues will continue to increase  as well as represent a higher proportion of our total revenue as more enterprise product customers purchase support compared to our consumer product customers 
maintenance and support pricing is reflective of the license cost of the products and the additional support it takes to maintain and support the products and customers 
with higher maintenance and support revenues  we will recognize additional deferred revenue as we earn the revenue over the life of the maintenance and support agreement 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of royalties  a portion of our bandwidth costs as well as production  packaging and shipping costs for boxed copies of software products 
cost of revenues increased by approximately between periods from  in to  in this increase was largely caused by an increase in royalty payments and bandwidth costs  offset by a decrease in payments made to the us general services administration gsa 
the approximate  increase in royalties was due to the addition of royalty payments to two new companies 
the approximate  increase in bandwidth costs was due to a larger portion of these costs being recorded in cost of revenues as opposed to selling  general and administrative expenses 
in  all internet fees were recorded as a selling expense  however  as a significant portion of our revenues are from online sales  the company determined that a portion of those costs should be recognized as a cost of revenue 
the approximate  decrease in gsa payments was due to the company s not making sales on a gsa schedule during 
table of contents selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses  marketing  customer support  facility costs  bad debt and professional fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately from  in to  in as a percentage of revenue  sg a decreased from of revenue in to of revenue in this decrease of approximately  was mainly due to the company s concentrated cost control measures in the current year 
accounts with notable decreases were commissions  recruiting expense  business insurance  office rent expense  transition costs  service fees  billing fees  advertising expense  marketing expense and bad debt 
these decreases were offset by increases in several accounts including salaries  bonuses  stock compensation expense  professional fees  consulting fees  public relation fees and product development allocations 
the increase of approximately  in salaries was mainly attributable to the addition of a ceo and coo late in these positions were filled on an interim basis by one officer during approximately seven of the twelve months of bonus expense increased approximately  from the prior year due to the adoption of a new bonus structure in the increase of approximately  in stock compensation expense was due to several large option grants with high grant prices that were forfeited in the increase of approximately  in professional fees was due to a change in auditors and work performed on the goodwill impairment  as well as hiring an investor relations firm 
the increase of approximately  in consulting fees was due to the hiring of a consultant to specifically drive sales in the government industry 
public relations fees increased approximately  due to the hiring of a marketing communications firm earlier in finally  in   of software development costs were capitalized  no amounts were capitalized in because there were no projects that were eligible for capitalization 
commission expense decreased approximately  from the prior year due to a change in commission policy 
in january  additional commissions were paid to account for this change in policy 
this decrease was offset by the commissions on the us army order as well as a higher percentage paid on maintenance and support renewals 
recruiting expense was approximately  higher in due to the hiring of a senior accountant and several software engineers as well as fees paid for the search for a ceo 
the company was charged approximately  in for business insurance 
in the charges for business insurance were not repeated and the company received a credit of approximately  related to the prior year amount 
the activity resulted in a net decrease to business insurance expense of  with the closing of the andover  ma office in december a reserve was established at that time for all expenses related to the closing 
the rent for that office was charged against the reserve established  and therefore  resulted in an approximate  decrease in rent expense for year as compared to year this decrease in rent expense was offset by an increase of approximately  due to rent expense paid in for the final payment on the prior office rental space in san antonio 
restructuring costs were approximately  higher in due to the closing of the andover  massachusetts office in december the reduction of approximately  in service fees was due to a larger portion of internet costs being classified in cost of revenues  as well as reduced fees with the closing of the andover office 
the reduction of billing fees of approximately  was due to fewer online sales 
advertising expense decreased by approximately  due to the optimization of google search ads 
the decrease of approximately  in marketing expense was due to the discontinued use of several marketing firms

depreciation expense increased by approximately  due to more property additions in the current year 
impairment 
during we performed an analysis of the future expected cash flows from the sale of the wafs and cdp products 
this analysis revealed a significant decrease in cash flows as compared to original expectations when availl was purchased in therefore in accordance with us gaap an impairment charge of million was recorded against the goodwill and an impairment charge of million was recorded against the software intangible asset 
we performed the same analysis in and no impairment was recorded 
other income expense  net

we derive our revenues primarily from software sales 
revenue is comprised of the gross selling price of software  including shipping charges and the earned portion of maintenance and support agreements 
revenues decreased from  in to  in the decrease of approximately million or approximately in revenues was attributable to a million sale to the us army in excluding this sale  revenues increased by  in or of revenues as compared to we believe this revenue performance  while positive  reflects the economic turmoil experienced during the second half of

excluding this single order  sales of secureftp server and eft server increased by in when compared to in total  our secure ftp server and enhanced file transfer products represented approximately of our total revenues in as compared to in revenues from cuteftp decreased by from million in to million in and accounted for approximately and of total revenues in and  respectively 
this decrease was the result of the continuing maturity of the cuteftp product line and the availability of low cost alternatives to occasional users 
we believe that our reliance on the cuteftp products  and the percentage of revenue derived from these products  will continue to decline as we continue to grow sales of our enterprise products 
in addition  because of the more complex nature of secureftp server  enhanced file transfer  wafs and cdp compared to cuteftp  purchasers of those products require increased maintenance and support 
as a result  our maintenance and support revenues increased by from  in to  in  net of deferred revenue 
maintenance and support pricing is reflective of the license cost of the products and the additional support it takes to maintain and support the products and customers 
with higher maintenance and support revenues  we will recognize additional deferred revenue as we earn the revenue over the life of the maintenance and support agreement 
wide area file services and continuous data protection products accounted for approximately of total revenue for  approximately the same percentage of revenue as in the wide area file services continuous data protection revenues have not increased as originally anticipated due to continued development activity necessary to position the product for broader market adoption 
the amount of time required to make improvements to our wide area file services and continuous data protection products that we believe are necessary have been greater than originally expected 
we plan to release an upgraded version of the wide area file services software in the first half of and expect this version will solidify the revenue for this product line and provide a platform for further development 
we introduced our managed e mail attachment solution mail express late in and expect to gain market traction with this product during similarly  we launched cutesendit as a saas solution in mid and believe it will contribute synergistically to additional sales of our other solutions 
cost of revenues

cost of revenues decreased 
table of contents by approximately between periods from  in to  in royalty expenses  the major component of cost of revenues  declined primarily as the result of the non renewal of the third party software distribution agreements with beehive  hannon hill  g k  and visicom

research and development expenses increased by approximately from  in to  in based on a strategic decision to focus on product development 
this increase was largely due to the addition of employees in the engineering department 
overall  we have grown our research and development capability to deliver enhanced versions of our legacy products while defining  developing  and launching new solutions
