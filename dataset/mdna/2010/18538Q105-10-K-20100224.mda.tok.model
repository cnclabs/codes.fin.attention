recent developments and overview as of december   we operated in markets in the united states and europe  covering an estimated million people 
we had approximately  retail and  wholesale subscribers as of december  we are the first mobile broadband service provider to launch a g mobile broadband network in the united states based on the e standard  which we refer to as mobile wimax 
the mobile wimax standard facilitates fourth generation wireless services  which are commonly referred to in the wireless industry as g mobile broadband services 
we operated g mobile broadband networks in of our markets in the united states as of december   covering an estimated population of million people 
these markets include  among others  atlanta  baltimore  charlotte  chicago  dallas  honolulu  las vegas  philadelphia  portland  oregon  san antonio  and seattle 
as of december   our other markets continued to operate with a legacy network technology 
our legacy network technology is based on a proprietary set of technical standards offered by a subsidiary of motorola 
this pre g technology offers higher broadband speeds than traditional wireless carriers  but lacks the mobile functionality of our current g technology 
in  we converted of our legacy markets in the united states to g mobile broadband under the clear tm brand  and we intend to upgrade the majority of our remaining legacy markets in the united states to g technology over the next year 
during november  we entered into agreements to raise a total of billion  which included a billion equity investment from the participating equityholders and gross proceeds of billion from a debt issuance 
the debt issuance allowed us to retire our existing indebtedness under our senior term loan facility and extend our debt maturity into we intend to use the net proceeds of this new financing to continue the expansion of our g mobile broadband networks 
our current plan is to expand our g mobile broadband networks 
table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued to reach up to million mhz pops by the end of and launch our g mobile broadband network in several new markets during  including new york  boston  washington dc  houston  and the san francisco bay area 
our actual network coverage by the end of will largely be determined by our ability to successfully manage ongoing development activities and our performance in our launched markets 
business segments operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker  which we refer to as the codm  in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
operating segments can be aggregated for segment reporting purposes so long as certain aggregation criteria are met 
we define the codm as our chief executive officer 
as our business continues to mature  we assess how we view and operate our business 
based on the nature of our operations  we market a product that is basically the same product across our united states and international markets 
our codm assesses and reviews the company s performance and makes resource allocation decisions at the domestic and international levels 
for the years ended december  and  we have identified two reportable segments the united states and the international business 
in  we only had one reportable business segment the united states  as we had no international operations prior to the completion of the transactions on november   when old clearwire and the sprint wimax business combined their next generation wireless broadband businesses to form clearwire 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates used  including those related to long lived assets and intangible assets  including spectrum  share based compensation  and deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
our accounting policies require management to make complex and subjective judgments 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
these factors could have a material impact on our financial statements  the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
we have identified the following accounting policies and estimates that involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and that we believe are key to an understanding of our financial statements spectrum licenses  impairments of long lived assets  share based compensation  accounting for property  plant equipment  and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
spectrum licenses we have three types of arrangements for spectrum licenses owned spectrum licenses with indefinite lives  owned spectrum licenses with definite lives and spectrum leases 
while owned spectrum licenses in the united states are issued for a fixed time  renewals of these licenses have occurred routinely and at nominal cost 
moreover  management has determined that there are currently no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our owned spectrum licenses and therefore  the licenses are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite lives 
changes in these factors may have a significant effect on our assessment of the useful lives of our owned spectrum licenses 

table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we assess the impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  consisting primarily of spectrum licenses  at least annually  or whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of such asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
our annual impairment testing is performed as of each october st and we perform a review of the existence of events or changes in circumstances related to the recoverability of our intangible assets with indefinite useful lives on a quarterly basis 
factors we consider important  any of which could trigger an impairment review  include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
our spectrum licenses in the united states are combined into a single unit of account for purposes of testing impairment because management believes that utilizing these licenses as a group represents the highest and best use of the assets and is consistent with the management s strategy of utilizing our spectrum licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide network 
the impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
we performed our test of the fair value of spectrum using a discounted cash flow model the greenfield approach  which approximates value by assuming a company is started owning only the spectrum licenses  and then makes investments required to build an operation comparable to the one in which the licenses are presently utilized 
we utilized a year discrete period to isolate cash flows attributable to the licenses including modeling the hypothetical build out 
assumptions key in estimating fair value under this method include  but are not limited to  revenue and subscriber growth rates  operating expenditures  capital expenditures  availability of adequate funding  market share achieved  terminal value growth rate  tax rates and discount rate 
the assumptions which underlie the development of the network  subscriber base and other critical inputs of the discounted cash flow model were based on a combination of average marketplace participant data and our historical results and business plans 
the discount rate used in the model represents a weighted average cost of capital taking into account our cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in our target capital structure and the perceived risk associated with an intangible asset such as our spectrum licenses 
the terminal value growth rate represents our estimate of the marketplace s long term growth rate 
we had no impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets in any of the periods presented 
if the projected rate of growth of revenues and capital expenditures were to decline by  the fair values of the licenses  while less than currently projected  would still be higher than their book values 
the accounting estimates for our intangible assets with indefinite useful lives require management to make significant assumptions about fair value based on forecasted cash flows that consider our business and technology strategy  management s views of growth rates for the business  anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability 
if there is a substantial adverse decline in the operating profitability of the wireless service industry  we could have material impairment charges in future years which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
impairments of long lived assets we review our long lived assets to be held and used  including property  plant and equipment  which we refer to as pp e  and intangible assets with definite useful lives  which consists primarily of spectrum licenses with definite lives  for recoverability whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of such long lived asset or group of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
such circumstances include  but are not limited to the following a significant decrease in the market price of the asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used  
table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued a significant change in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  a current period loss combined with projections of continuing losses associated with use of the asset  a significant change in our business or technology strategy  a significant change in our management s views of growth rates for our business  and a significant change in the anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability 
we evaluate quarterly  or as needed  whether such events and circumstances have occurred 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining the occurrence of an indicator of impairment that requires an evaluation of the recoverability of our long lived assets 
when such events or circumstances exist  we would determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value by estimating the undiscounted future net cash flows cash inflows less associated cash outflows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the asset 
recoverability analyses  when performed  are based on forecasted cash flows that consider our business and technology strategy  management s views of growth rates for the business  anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability 
for purposes of recognition and measurement  we group our long lived assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and we test for impairment on an aggregate basis for assets in the united states consistent with the management of the business on a national scope 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss  if any  is recognized for the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
during the year ended december   there were no triggering events requiring us to perform an impairment test for long lived assets 
in addition to the analyses described above  we periodically assess certain assets that have not yet been deployed in our network  including network equipment and cell site development costs 
this assessment includes the write off of network equipment for estimated shrinkage experienced during the deployment process and the write off of network equipment and cell site development costs whenever events or changes in circumstances cause us to conclude that such assets are no longer needed to meet management s strategic network plans and will not be deployed 
share based compensation we account for our share based compensation by measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all share based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we recognize compensation costs  net of estimated forfeitures  for those shares expected to vest on a graded vesting schedule over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term of four years 
we issue incentive awards to our employees through stock based compensation consisting of stock options and restricted stock units  which we refer to as rsus 
the value of rsus is determined using the fair value method  which in this case  is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of class a common stock on the date of grant 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which we refer to as bsm  to estimate the fair value of stock options which requires complex and judgmental assumptions including estimated stock price volatility and employee exercise patterns expected life of the option 
the computation of expected volatility is based on an average historical volatility from common shares of a group of our peers as well as our own volatility 
the expected life of options granted is based on the simplified calculation of expected life due to lack of option exercise history 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially for future grants as compared to the current period 

table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of stock options or rsus that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply an estimated forfeiture rate that is derived from historical employee termination behavior 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  adjustments to stock based compensation expense may be required in future periods 
property  plant equipment as we continue to deploy our network  a significant portion of our total assets is pp e 
pp e represented billion of our billion in total assets as of december  we generally calculate depreciation on these assets using the straight line method based on estimated economic useful lives 
the estimated useful life of equipment is determined based on historical usage of identical or similar equipment  with consideration given to technological changes and industry trends that could impact the network architecture and asset utilization 
since changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets  as well as changes in broad economic or industry factors  may cause the estimated period of use of these assets to change  we periodically review these factors to assess the remaining life of our asset base 
when these factors indicate that an asset s useful life is different from the previous assessment  we depreciate the remaining book values prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life 
we capitalize certain direct costs incurred to prepare the asset for its intended use 
we also capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or construction of network related assets 
capitalized interest and direct costs are reported as part of the cost of the network related assets and as a reduction in the related expense in the statement of operations 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our limited operating history  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income loss  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 

table of contents clearwire corporation and subsidiaries results of operations within this results of operations section  we disclose results of operations on both an as reported and a pro forma basis 
the reported results for and are not necessarily representative of our ongoing operations as old clearwire s results are included only for the period of time after the november  closing 
prior to that date  the reported results reflect only the sprint wimax business results 
therefore  to facilitate an understanding of our trends and on going performance  we have presented pro forma results in addition to the reported results 
the unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations were prepared in accordance with article pro forma financial information of securities and exchange commission regulation s x 
the pro forma results include both the sprint wimax business and old clearwire for and  as adjusted for certain pro forma purchase accounting adjustments and other non recurring charges  and give effect to the transactions as though the closing had occurred as of january  a reconciliation of pro forma amounts to reported amounts has been included under the heading pro forma reconciliation 
the unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations do not give effect to the offering of the senior secured notes and the additional private placement or the rights offering or the application of the net proceeds from these transactions 
the following table sets forth as reported operating data for the periods presented in thousands  except per share data 
as reported results year ended december  compared to the years ended december  and consolidated statements of operations year ended december  revenues operating expenses cost of goods and services and network costs exclusive of items shown separately below selling  general and administrative expense depreciation and amortization spectrum lease expense transaction related expenses total operating expenses operating loss other income expense interest income interest expense other income expense  net total other income expense  net loss before income taxes income tax provision net loss less non controlling interests in net loss of consolidated subsidiaries net loss attributable to clearwire corporation net loss attributable to clearwire corporation per class a common share basic diluted 
table of contents year ended december  weighted average clearwire class a common shares outstanding basic diluted prior to the closing  we had no equity as we were a wholly owned division of sprint 
as such  we did not calculate or present net loss per share for the period from january  to november  we have calculated and presented basic and diluted net loss per share for the period from november  through december  and for the year ended december  revenues revenues are primarily generated from subscription and modem lease fees for our g and pre g services  as well as from activation fees and fees for other services such as email  voip  and web hosting services 
year ended percentage percentage december  change change in thousands  except percentages versus versus revenues   n m the increase in revenues for compared to is primarily due to twelve months of revenues received from our operation of markets in  compared to one month for following the closing on november   when we acquired all of the old clearwire markets and subscribers 
we launched new g markets in and began offering our services through wholesale partners in all of our g markets 
revenues in the united states represented and international represented of total revenues for the year ended december   compared to for the united states and for international for the year ended december  as of december   we operated our services in domestic and international markets  compared to domestic and international markets as of december  total subscribers in all markets were approximately  as of december   compared to  as of december  the increase in revenues for compared to is primarily due to the revenues received from operations of clearwire following the closing on november   when we acquired all of the old clearwire markets and subscribers 
there were no subscribers as of december  we expect revenues to continue to increase due to the roll out of new g markets  which will increase the markets we serve and our subscriber base  and as a result of increased adoption of new services by our customers 
in addition  we expect that average revenue per user  which we refer to as arpu  to remain stable in compared to as increases resulting from multiple service offerings per customer will likely be offset by the impact of promotional pricing 
cost of goods and services and network costs exclusive of depreciation and amortization cost of goods and services includes costs associated with tower rents  direct internet access and backhaul  which is the transporting of data traffic between distributed sites and a central point in the market or point of presence 
cost of goods and services also includes certain network equipment  site costs  facilities costs  software licensing and certain office equipment 
network costs primarily consist of external services and internal payroll incurred in connection with the design  development and construction of the network 
the external services include consulting fees  contractor fees and project based fees that are not capitalizable 
year ended percentage percentage december  change change in thousands  except percentages versus versus cost of goods and services and network costs 
table of contents cost of goods and services and network costs increased million in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in tower lease and backhaul expenses resulting from the launch of new g markets 
we incurred twelve months of tower lease and backhaul expense during  compared to one month for following the closing on november   when we acquired all of the old clearwire tower leases and backhaul agreements 
during  we incurred approximately million related to write offs of cpe and network and base station equipment and an increase in our obsolescence and shrinkage allowance 
also  we incurred approximately million for cost abandonments associated with market redesigns 
cost of goods and services and network costs increased million in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in tower lease and backhaul expenses due to our acquisition of old clearwire on november  we expect costs of goods and services and network costs to continue to increase in as we expand our network 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses include all of the following costs associated with advertising  trade shows  public relations  promotions and other market development programs  third party professional service fees  salaries and benefits  sales commissions  travel expenses and related facilities costs for sales  marketing  network development  executive  finance and accounting  it  customer care  human resource and legal personnel  network deployment expenses representing non capitalizable costs on network builds in markets prior to launch  rather than costs related to our markets after launch  which are included in cost of goods and services and network costs  and human resources  treasury services and other shared services 
year ended percentage percentage december  change change in thousands  except percentages versus versus selling  general and administrative expense the increase in compared to is consistent with the additional resources  headcount and shared services that we have utilized as we continue to build and launch our g mobile broadband services in additional markets  especially the higher sales and marketing and customer care expenses in support of the launch of new markets 
employee headcount increased at december  to approximately  employees compared to approximately  employees at december  the increase in compared to is due to higher employee compensation and related costs  which includes facilities costs  resulting from the acquisition of old clearwire and all of its employees and higher sales and marketing and customer care expenses in support of the launch of the baltimore market 
our focus in will be on development and expansion of our wireless g network 
we expect that cost per gross addition will remain stable in compared to as new markets are launched  consistent with our past operating experiences 
depreciation and amortization year ended percentage percentage december  change change in thousands  except percentages versus versus depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense primarily represents the depreciation recorded on pp e and amortization of intangible assets and definite lived owned spectrum 
the increase in is primarily a result of new network assets placed into service to support our launches and continued network expansion 
the increase is also due to months depreciation and amortization expense recorded on assets acquired in connection with our 
table of contents acquisition of old clearwire  compared to approximately one month in for the period after the closing on november  during the year ended december   substantially all of the capital expenditures by the sprint wimax business represented construction work in progress and therefore very little depreciation was recorded 
we expect depreciation and amortization will continue to increase as additional g markets are launched and placed into service during spectrum lease expense year ended percentage percentage december  change change in thousands  except percentages versus versus spectrum lease expense total spectrum lease expense increased in compared to as a direct result of a significant increase in the number of spectrum leases held by us 
we doubled the number of leased call signs when we acquired all of the old clearwire leases 
the increase is also due to months spectrum lease expense recorded on leases in for spectrum leases acquired from old clearwire  compared to approximately one month in for the period after the closing on november  many of the leases were entered into before and the periodic payments before january  were funded by sprint 
with the significant number of new spectrum leases and the increasing cost of these leases  we expect our spectrum lease expense to increase 
as we renegotiate these leases  they are replaced with new leases  usually at a higher lease cost per month  but with longer terms 
transaction related expenses year ended percentage percentage december  change change in thousands  except percentages versus versus transaction related expenses  n m n m transaction related expenses in include a one time million settlement loss resulting from the termination of spectrum lease agreements under which sprint leased spectrum to old clearwire prior to the closing 
as part of the closing  sprint contributed both the spectrum lease agreements and the spectrum assets underlying those agreements to our business 
as a result of the closing  the spectrum lease agreements were effectively terminated  and the settlement of those agreements was accounted for as a separate element apart from the business combination 
the settlement loss recognized from the termination was valued based on the amount by which the agreements were favorable or unfavorable to our business as compared to current market rates 
interest expense year ended percentage percentage december  change change in thousands  except percentages versus versus interest expense   n m we incurred twelve months of interest costs totaling million  which were partially offset by capitalized interest of million for the year ended december  interest expense for also includes an adjustment to accrete the debt to par value 
interest expense for included million of interest expense recorded on the note payable to sprint for the repayment of an obligation to reimburse sprint for financing the sprint wimax business between april  and the closing  which we refer to as the sprint pre closing financing amount  and one month of interest expense totaling million on the long term debt acquired from old clearwire 

table of contents we acquired our debt as a result of the acquisition of old clearwire on november   therefore we did not incur any interest expense during other income expense  net year ended percentage percentage december  change change in thousands  except percentages versus versus other than temporary impairment loss on investments   n m loss on undesignated swap contracts  net   n m gain on debt extinguishment  n m n m other total during  we recorded an other than temporary impairment loss of million on our auction rate securities 
during the year ended december   we incurred other than temporary impairment losses of million related to these securities 
we acquired our auction rate securities as a result of the acquisition of old clearwire on november   therefore we did not incur any other than temporary impairment losses during during november  we recorded a gain of million in connection with the retirement of our senior term loan facility and terminated the swap contracts 
income tax provision year ended percentage percentage december  change change in thousands  except percentages versus versus income tax provision the decrease in the income tax provision for compared to is primarily due to the change in our deferred tax position as a result of the closing 
prior to the closing  the income tax provision was primarily due to increased deferred liabilities from additional amortization taken for federal income tax purposes by the sprint wimax business on certain indefinite lived licensed spectrum 
as a result of the closing  the only united states temporary difference is the basis difference associated with our investment in clearwire communications  a partnership for united states income tax purposes 
the increase in the income tax provision for compared to is primarily due to increased deferred tax liabilities from additional amortization taken for federal income tax purposes by the sprint wimax business on certain indefinite lived licensed spectrum prior to the closing 
the ongoing difference between book and tax amortization resulted in an additional deferred income tax provision of million in prior to the closing 
we project that the partnership will have additional losses in the united states in we do not believe such losses will be realizable at a more likely than not level and accordingly  the projected additional losses allocated to us in will not result in a united states tax provision or benefit for non controlling interests in net loss of consolidated subsidiaries year ended percentage percentage december  change change in thousands  except percentages versus versus non controlling interests in net loss of consolidated subsidiaries   n m 
table of contents the non controlling interests in net loss represent the allocation of a portion of the consolidated net loss to the non controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries based on the ownership by sprint  comcast  time warner cable  intel and bright house of clearwire communications class b common interests 
the increase in is primarily due to allocating months of losses to the non controlling interests in as compared to approximately one month in prior to the closing  there were no non controlling interests

table of contents sprint nextel corporation entered into an agreement with old clearwire to combine both of their next generation wireless broadband businesses to form a new independent company 
on closing  old clearwire and the sprint wimax business completed the combination to form clearwire 
the transactions were accounted for as a reverse acquisition with the sprint wimax business deemed to be the accounting acquirer 
at the closing  the investors made an aggregate billion capital contribution to clearwire and its subsidiary  clearwire communications 
in exchange for the contribution of the sprint wimax business and their investments  as applicable  google initially received  shares of class a common stock and sprint and the other investors received in aggregate  shares of class b common stock and an equivalent amount of clearwire communications class b common interests 
the number of shares of class a and b common stock and clearwire communications class b common interests  as applicable  that the investors were entitled to receive under the transaction agreement was subject to a post closing adjustment based on the trading price of class a common stock on nasdaq over randomly selected trading days during the day period ending on the th day after the closing  or february   which we refer to as the adjustment date  with a floor of per share and a cap of per share 
during the measurement period  class a common stock traded below per share on nasdaq  so on the adjustment date  we issued to the investors an additional  shares of class a common stock and  shares of class b common stock and clearwire communications class b common interests to reflect the final price per share 
additionally  in accordance with the subscription agreement  on february   cw investment holdings llc purchased  shares of class a common stock at per share for a total investment of million 
for the purpose of determining the number of shares outstanding within the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations  we assumed that the additional shares and common interests issued to the investors and cw investment holdings llc on the adjustment date and february   respectively  were issued as of the closing and that the closing was consummated on january  in connection with the integration of the sprint wimax business and old clearwire operations  we expect that certain non recurring charges will be incurred 
we also expect that certain synergies might be realized due to operating efficiencies or future revenue synergies expected to result from the transactions 
however  in preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations  which give effect to the transactions as if they were consummated on january   no pro forma adjustments have been reflected to consider any such costs or benefits 
pro forma adjustments related to purchase accounting and other non recurring charges for the years ended december  and the pro forma adjustments related to purchase accounting have been derived from the allocation of the purchase consideration to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed of old clearwire  including the allocation of the excess of the estimated fair value of net assets acquired over the purchase price 
article of regulation s x requires that pro forma adjustments reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations are directly related to the transaction for which pro forma financial information is presented and have a continuing impact on the results of operations 
certain charges have been excluded in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations as such charges were incurred in direct connection with or at the time of the transactions and are not expected to have an ongoing impact on the results of operations after the closing 
a represents the accelerated vesting of stock options for certain members of management upon the closing  which resulted in a one time charge of approximately million recorded by old clearwire in its historical financial statements for the months ended november  as these are non recurring charges directly attributable to the transactions  they are excluded from the unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the year ended december  b represents adjustments in the depreciation expense on a pro forma basis related to items of old clearwire pp e that are being depreciated over their estimated remaining useful lives on a straight line basis 
the reduction in depreciation expense results from a decrease in the carrying value of old clearwire pp e 
table of contents due to the allocation of the excess of the estimated fair value of net assets acquired over the purchase price used in purchase accounting for the transactions 
c represents adjustments to record amortization on a pro forma basis related to old clearwire spectrum lease contracts and other intangible assets over their estimated weighted average remaining useful lives on a straight line basis 
the increase in the amortization expense results from an increase in the carrying value of the old clearwire spectrum lease contracts and other intangible assets resulting from purchase accounting 
d represents the elimination of intercompany other income and related expenses associated with the historical agreements pre closing between the sprint wimax business and old clearwire  where old clearwire leased spectrum licenses from the sprint wimax business 
the other income and related expenses were million and million for twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
e represents the reversal of transaction costs of million for the year ended december   comprised of million of investment banking fees and million of other professional fees  recorded in the old clearwire historical financial statements for the year ended december  as these are non recurring charges directly attributable to the transactions  they are excluded from the unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the year ended december  f prior to the closing  sprint leased spectrum to old clearwire through various spectrum lease agreements 
as part of the transactions  sprint contributed both the spectrum lease agreements and the spectrum assets underlying those agreements 
as a result of the transactions  the spectrum lease agreements were effectively terminated  and the settlement of those agreements was accounted for as a separate element from the business combination 
a settlement loss of million resulted from the termination as the agreements were considered to be unfavorable to clearwire relative to current market rates 
this one time charge recorded by clearwire at the closing is excluded from the unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations 
g prior to the closing  old clearwire refinanced the senior term loan facility and renegotiated the loan terms 
historical interest expense related to the senior term loan facility before the refinancing and amortization of the deferred financing fees recorded by old clearwire  in the amounts of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  have been reversed as if the transactions were consummated on january  additionally  the loss on extinguishment of debt of million recorded for the year ended december  was reversed in the unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations 
h represents the adjustment to record pro forma interest expense assuming the senior term loan facility  including the sprint pre closing financing as defined in the transaction agreement under the amended credit agreement as defined below  was outstanding as of january  the closing would have resulted in an event of default under the terms of the credit agreement underlying the senior term loan facility unless the consent of the lenders was obtained 
on november   old clearwire entered into the amended and restated credit agreement with the lenders to obtain their consent and to satisfy other conditions to closing under the transaction agreement  which we refer to as the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement resulted in additional fees to be paid and adjustments to the underlying interest rates 
the sprint pre closing financing was assumed by clearwire on the closing  as a result of the financing of the sprint wimax business operations by sprint for the period from april   through the closing  and added as an additional tranche of term loans under the amended credit agreement 
pro forma interest expense was calculated over the period using the effective interest method resulting in an adjustment of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  based on an effective interest rate of approximately percent 
pro forma interest expense also reflects an adjustment to accrete the debt to par value 
pro forma interest expense was calculated based on the contractual terms under the amended credit agreement  assuming a term equal to its 
table of contents contractual maturity of months and the underlying interest rate was the libor loan base rate of percent  as the month libor rate in effect at the closing was less than the base rate  plus the applicable margin 
the calculation assumed an applicable margin of percent and additional rate increases as specified in the amended credit agreement over the term of the loan 
a one eighth percentage change in the interest rate would increase or decrease interest expense by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total interest expense on a pro forma basis does not include an adjustment for capitalized interest 
i represents the adjustment to reflect the pro forma income tax expense for the years ended december  and  which was determined by computing the pro forma effective tax rates for the years ended december  and  giving effect to the transactions 
clearwire expects to generate net operating losses into the foreseeable future and thus has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets not expected to be realized 
therefore  for years ended december  and  no tax benefit was recognized 
j represents the allocation of a portion of the pro forma combined net loss to the non controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries based on sprint s and the investors other than google ownership of the clearwire communications class b common interests upon closing of the transactions and reflects the contributions by cw investment holdings llc and the investors at per share following the post closing adjustment 
this adjustment is based on pre tax loss since income tax consequences associated with any loss allocated to the clearwire communications class b common interests will be incurred directly by sprint and the investors other than google and cw investment holdings llc 
pro forma net loss per share the clearwire combined pro forma net loss per share presented below assumes the closing of the transactions and that the class a and b common stock and clearwire communications class b common interests issued to sprint  the investors and cw investment holdings llc were outstanding from january   and reflects the resolution of the post closing price adjustment at per share 
the shares of class b common stock have nominal equity rights 
these shares have no right to dividends of clearwire and no right to any proceeds on liquidation other than the par value of class b common stock 
the following table presents the pro forma number of clearwire shares outstanding as if the transactions had been consummated on january  in thousands basic diluted class a common stock held by existing stockholders i class a common stock sold to google i class a common stock sold to cw investment holdings llc i class b common stock issued to sprint ii class b common stock sold to comcast ii class b common stock sold to intel ii class b common stock sold to time warner cable ii class b common stock sold to bright house ii weighted average class a common stock outstanding i shares outstanding related to class a common stock held by clearwire stockholders has been derived from the sum of the number of shares of old clearwire class a common stock and old clearwire class b common stock issued and outstanding at november   and subject to conversion of each share of old clearwire class a common stock and old clearwire class b common stock into the right to receive one share of class a common stock 
the basic weighted average shares outstanding related to class a common stock are the shares issued in the transactions and assumed to be outstanding for the entire period for which loss per share is being calculated 
the computation of pro forma diluted class a common stock did not include the effects of 
table of contents the following options  restricted stock units and warrants as the inclusion of these securities would have been anti dilutive in thousands as of november  stock options warrants restricted stock units ii holders of class b common stock will be entitled at any time to exchange one share of class b common stock  in combination with one clearwire communications class b common interest  for one share of class a common stock 
shares of class b common stock have no impact on pro forma basic net loss per share because they do not participate in net income loss or distributions 
however  the hypothetical exchange of clearwire communications class b common interests together with class b common stock for class a common stock may have a dilutive effect on pro forma diluted loss per share due to certain tax effects 
as previously mentioned  that exchange would result in a decrease to the non controlling interests and a corresponding increase in net loss attributable to the class a common stock 
further  to the extent that all of the clearwire communications class b common interests and class b common stock are converted to class a common stock on a pro forma basis  the partnership structure is assumed to no longer exist and clearwire would be required to recognize a tax charge related to indefinite lived intangible assets 
net loss attributable to holders of class a common stock  assuming conversion of the clearwire communications class b common interests and class b common stock  is as follows in thousands year ended december  pro forma net loss non controlling interests in net loss of consolidated subsidiaries less pro forma tax adjustment resulting from dissolution of clearwire communications net loss attributable to class a common stockholders  assuming the exchange of class b common stock and clearwire communications class b common interests to class a common stock the pro forma net loss per share attributable to holders of class a common stock on a basic and diluted basis is calculated as follows in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  basic diluted basic diluted pro forma net loss attributable to class a common stockholders weighted average clearwire class a common stock outstanding basic and diluted pro forma net loss per share of class a common stock 
table of contents liquidity and capital resource requirements we are currently engaged in the development and deployment of g mobile broadband networks throughout the united states 
in  we plan to develop and launch g mobile broadband networks in large metropolitan areas in the united states  including boston  houston  new york  san francisco and washington  dc we expect that the combination of our existing g markets  new market deployments and existing market conversions will allow us to cover as many as million people with our g mobile broadband networks by the end of however  our actual network coverage by the end of will largely be determined by our ability to successfully manage ongoing development activities and our performance in launched markets 
we currently expect a full year cash spend of billion to billion 
at the closing  we received an aggregate of billion of cash proceeds from the investors 
we have used and we expect to continue to use the proceeds from this investment primarily to expand our g mobile broadband networks in the united states  for spectrum acquisitions and for general corporate purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  we secured financing of billion as the result of the private placement and the issuance of the senior secured notes 
we received aggregate proceeds of billion in the fourth quarter of  and the third investment closing for an additional million is expected to occur by early march the debt issuance allowed us to retire our existing senior term loan facility and to extend the maturity of our debt until we expect the remaining net cash proceeds of approximately billion from this investment and debt financing to primarily be used to expand our g mobile broadband networks in the united states  for spectrum acquisitions and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   we had available cash and short term investments of approximately billion 
as of december   we believe that we held sufficient cash and short term investments to provide us with our required liquidity for at least months 
the amount of capital that we will require to fully implement our current plans depends on a number of factors  many of which are difficult to predict and outside of our control 
in preparing our plans  we were required to make certain assumptions as to the future performance of our business 
if any of the assumptions underlying our plans prove to be incorrect and  as a result  our business fails to perform as we expect  we may require additional capital in the near and long term to fund operating losses  network expansion plans and spectrum acquisitions 
further  we regularly evaluate our plans  and these evaluations often result in changes  some of which may be material and may significantly increase or decrease our capital requirements in the near and or long term 
these changes may include  among other things  modifying the pace at which we build our g mobile broadband networks  augmenting our network coverage in markets we launch  changing our sales and marketing strategy and or acquiring additional spectrum 
we also may elect to deploy alternative technologies to mobile wimax  if and when they become available  on our networks either in place of  or together with  mobile wimax if we determine it is necessary to cause the g mobile broadband services we offer to remain competitive or to expand the number and types of devices that may be used to access our services 
alternatively  if we determine that we need additional capital for our business  but are unsuccessful in obtaining additional financing  we may elect to curtail our current plans to reduce the capital needed 
the amount and timing of any additional financings to satisfy these additional capital needs  if any  are difficult to estimate at this time 
to raise additional capital  we may be required to issue additional equity securities in public or private offerings 
we may seek significant additional debt financing 
our existing level of debt may make it more difficult for us to obtain this debt financing 
we also may decide to sell additional debt or equity securities in our domestic or international subsidiaries  which may dilute our ownership interest in  or reduce or eliminate our income  if any  from  those entities 
lastly  recent distress in the financial markets has resulted in extreme volatility in security prices  diminished liquidity and credit availability and declining valuations of certain investments 
we have assessed the implications of these factors on our current business and determined that there has not been a significant impact to our financial position or liquidity during if the national or global economy or credit market conditions in general were to deteriorate further in the future  it is possible that such changes could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional external financing 

table of contents cash flow analysis the following analysis includes the sources and uses of cash for the sprint wimax business for the first eleven months of prior to the closing and for  and the sources and uses of cash for clearwire subsequent to the closing 
the statement of cash flows includes the activities that were paid by sprint on behalf of us prior to the closing 
financing activities include funding advances from sprint through november  further  the net cash used in operating activities and the net cash used in investing activities for capital expenditures and acquisitions of spectrum licenses and patents represent transfers of expenses or assets paid for by other sprint subsidiaries

this is partially offset by million in cash received from customers  which increased as we grew our subscribers and launched additional markets 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december  and was due primarily to payments for operating expenses  as we continue to expand and operate our business 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities also included interest payments to service debt 
the net cash used is partially offset by million in cash received from customers 
investing activities during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was billion 
the net cash used in investing activities was due primarily to billion in cash paid for pp e  million in net purchases of available for sale securities and million in payments for acquisition of spectrum licenses and other intangibles 
during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was billion 
the net cash used in investing activities was due primarily to billion in purchases of available for sale securities following the billion cash investment from the investors  million in cash paid for pp e and million in payments for acquisition of spectrum licenses and other intangibles 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million of cash acquired from old clearwire as a result of the closing 
during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million 
the net cash used in investing activities is due to million in payments for acquisition of spectrum licenses and other intangibles and million in cash paid for pp e 

table of contents financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was billion for the year ended december  this is primarily due to billion of cash received from the private placement  billion received from the issuance of the senior secured notes and the rollover notes and million in proceeds from the issuance of shares of class a common stock to cw investments holdings llc and proceeds from exercises of class a common stock options 
these are partially offset by payments of billion on our senior term loan facility  which was retired on november  our payment obligations under the senior secured notes and rollover notes are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries on a senior basis and secured by certain assets of such subsidiaries on a first priority lien 
the senior secured notes and rollover notes contain limitations on our activities  which among other things include incurring additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness  making distributions or payment of dividends or certain other restricted payments or investments  making certain payments on indebtedness  entering into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries  selling or otherwise disposing of assets  merger  consolidation or sales of substantially all of our assets  entering transactions with affiliates  creating liens  issuing certain preferred stock or similar equity securities and making investments and acquiring assets 
at december   we were in compliance with our debt covenants 
net cash provided by financing activities was billion for the year ended december  this is primarily due to billion of cash received from the investors  million pre transaction funding from sprint and million from the sprint pre closing financing amount  up through the closing 
these are partially offset by million paid to sprint for partial reimbursement of the pre closing financing  a million debt financing fee and a million payment on our senior term loan facility 
net cash provided by financing activities was billion for the year ended december  this was due to advances from sprint 
contractual obligations the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments as of december  changes in our business needs or interest rates  as well as actions by third parties and other factors  may cause these estimates to change 
because these estimates are complex and necessarily subjective  our actual payments in future periods are likely to vary from those presented in the table 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations including principal and interest payments under our debt obligations  payments under our spectrum lease obligations  and other contractual obligations as of december  in thousands less than contractual obligations total year years years over years long term debt obligations interest payments operating lease obligations spectrum lease obligations spectrum service credits signed spectrum agreements network equipment purchase obligations other purchase obligations total our interest payment obligations are calculated for all years on debt obligations outstanding as of december   using an interest rate of a 

table of contents network equipment purchase obligations represent purchase commitments with take or pay obligations and or volume commitments for equipment that are non cancelable and outstanding purchase orders for network equipment for which we believe delivery is likely to occur 
other purchase obligations include minimum purchases we have committed to purchase from suppliers over time and or unconditional purchase obligations where we guarantee to make a minimum payment to suppliers for goods and services regardless of whether suppliers fully deliver them 
they include  among other things  agreements for backhaul  customer devices and it related and other services 
the amounts actually paid under some of these other agreements will likely be higher than the minimum commitments due to variable components of these agreements 
the more significant variable components that determine the ultimate obligation owed include hours contracted  subscribers and other factors 
in addition  we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and create an obligation to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as the actual delivery and acceptance of products or services 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
the table above also excludes blanket purchase order amounts where the orders are subject to cancellation or termination at our discretion or where the quantity of goods or services to be purchased or the payment terms are unknown because such purchase orders are not firm commitments 
we do not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june and december  the financial accounting standards board  which we refer to as the fasb  issued new accounting guidance that amends the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities 
the amendments will affect the overall consolidation analysis under the current accounting guidance 
the new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our financial condition and results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of liabilities when a quoted price in an active market is not available 
we adopted the new accounting guidance on october  the adoption did not have any impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued new accounting guidance that amends the revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements and expands the disclosure requirements related to such arrangements 
the new guidance amends the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements  establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  eliminates the residual method of allocation  and requires the application of relative selling price method in allocating the arrangement consideration to all deliverables 
the new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our financial condition and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued new accounting guidance that requires new disclosures related to fair value measurements 
the new guidance requires separate disclosure for transfers between level and and the activities in level reconciliation on a gross basis 
the new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december   except for the new disclosures related to level activities  which are effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  the new accounting guidance only amended the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements  therefore we do not expect the adoption to have any impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the market value of investments due to credit risk 

table of contents interest rate risk our primary interest rate risk is associated with our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of money market mutual funds  united states government and agency issues and other debt securities 
our investment portfolio has a weighted average maturity of months and a market yield of as of december  our primary interest rate risk exposure is to a decline in interest rates which would result in a decline in interest income 
due to the current market yield  a further decline in interest rates would have a de minimis impact on earnings 
foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as it relates to our international operations 
we currently do not hedge our currency exchange rate risk and  as such  we are exposed to fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar against other currencies 
our international subsidiaries and equity investees generally use the currency of the jurisdiction in which they reside  or local currency  as their functional currency 
assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and the resulting translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the reporting period 
the effects of changes in exchange rates between the designated functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated are recorded as foreign currency transaction gains losses and recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we believe that the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
credit risk at december   we held available for sale short term and long term investments with a fair value and carrying value of billion and a cost of billion  comprised of united states government and agency issues and other debt securities 
we regularly review the carrying value of our short term and long term investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary 
the estimated fair values of certain of our investments are subject to significant fluctuations due to volatility of the credit markets in general  company specific circumstances  changes in general economic conditions and use of management judgment when observable market prices and parameters are not fully available 
other debt securities are variable rate debt instruments whose interest rates are normally reset approximately every or days through an auction process 
a portion of our investments in other debt securities represent interests in collateralized debt obligations  which we refer to as cdos  supported by preferred equity securities of insurance companies and financial institutions with stated final maturity dates in and as of december  the total fair value and carrying value of our security interests in cdos was million and our cost was million 
we also own other debt securities that are auction rate market preferred securities issued by a monoline insurance company and these securities are perpetual and do not have a final stated maturity 
in july  the issuer s credit rating was downgraded to cc and caa by standard poor s and moody s rating services  respectively  and the total fair value and carrying value of our auction rate market preferred securities was written down to as of december  current market conditions do not allow us to estimate when the auctions for our other debt securities will resume  if ever  or if a secondary market will develop for these securities 
as a result  our other debt securities are classified as long term investments
