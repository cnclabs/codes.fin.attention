our institutional sales efforts include further developing relationships with institutional consultants  and also establishing direct relationships with institutional clients 
we manage sub advisory mandates that provide access to market segments that we would not otherwise serve 
for example  we currently serve as sub advisor to mutual funds offered by major financial institutions in retail channels 
such mandates are attractive to us as we have chosen not to build the large team of sales professionals typically required to service those channels 
we approach the servicing of those sub advisory relationships in a manner similar to our approach with other large institutional account clients 
we service the high net worth channel both directly and through third party intermediaries  such as wealth advisers who utilize our investment strategies in investment programs they construct for their clients 
during the current fiscal year  the company raised the minimum separate account size substantially for this channel

each former epoch fund is now co branded as a mainstay epoch fund 
in addition to an existing sub advisory relationship between eip and new york life investments for certain funds  and the adoption of the epoch funds indicated above  eip and new york life investments have entered into an arrangement wherein  among other things  eip and an affiliate of new york life investments have established a distribution and administration relationship with respect to certain separately managed account and unified managed account products  and for a period of three years new york life investments agrees to pay certain additional base fees and meet minimum distribution targets 
for the fiscal year ended june   new york life investment management  through the mainstay epoch funds and other funds sub advised by eip  accounted for approximately of consolidated operating revenues

table of contents compete with a large number of global and us investment advisors  commercial banks  broker dealers  insurance companies and other financial institutions 
according to pensions investments  a publication covering the money management industry  the company ranked as the nd largest asset management firm worldwide as of december   up from a ranking of rd at december  the company competes primarily on the basis of investment philosophy  performance  product features  range of products  and client service 
we believe that our investment style  investment products  and distribution channels enable us to compete effectively in our industry 
we also believe that being an independent asset management firm is a competitive advantage  enabling our business model to avoid conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both distribute and manage investment products 
while the company believes it will continue to be successful in growing its aum  it may be necessary to expend additional resources to compete effectively 
growth strategy as the company enters its seventh full year of operations  it remains focused on generating superior risk adjusted performance returns  providing the highest level of client service  and continuing to generate operating margins consistent with leading firms within our industry

while the company continues to actively seek such opportunities  there can be no assurance that acquisitions will be identified and consummated on terms that are favorable to the company  its business and its stockholders 
management believes that opportunities are available  but will only act on opportunities that it believes are accretive to the company s long term business strategy 
the company s ability to attract and retain key employees is paramount to the continued success of the business

risk factors 
as an investment management firm  risk is an inherent part of our business 
capital markets  by their nature  are prone to uncertainty and expose participants to a variety of risks 
while we devote significant resources across all of our operations to identify  measure  monitor  manage and analyze market and operating risk  our business  financial condition  operating results  or share price could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks 
additionally  other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect us in the future 
you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
risks related to our business our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by negative performance of the securities markets 
our investment advisory and investment management business would be expected to generate lower revenues in a market or general economic downturn 
under our asset management business arrangements  investment advisory fees we receive typically are based on the market value of aum 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities would be expected to cause our revenue and net income to decline by causing the value of our aum to decrease  which would result in lower investment advisory fees  and or causing some of our clients to withdraw funds from our asset management business in favor of investments they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk  which also would result in lower investment advisory fees 
because of market fluctuations  there may not be a consistent pattern in our financial results from period to period 
this may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we may experience significant fluctuations in revenue and profits 
because our revenues are based on the value of aum  a decline in the value of aum would adversely affect our revenues 
because of 
table of contents market fluctuations  it may be difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis  which could lead to large adverse movements in the price of our common stock or increased volatility in our stock price 
investment performance affects our aum related to existing clients and is one of the most important factors in retaining clients and competing for new asset management business 
poor investment performance could impair our revenue and growth because existing clients might withdraw funds from our asset management business in favor of better performing products  which would result in lower investment advisory fees  third party financial intermediaries  advisers or consultants may rate our products poorly  which may result in client withdrawals and reduced asset flows from these third parties or their clients  or firms with which we have strategic alliances may terminate such relationships with us  and future strategic alliances may be unavailable 
our investment style in the asset management business may underperform other investment approaches  which may result in significant client or asset departures or a reduction in aum 
even when securities prices are rising  performance can be affected by investment style 
many of the equity investment strategies in our asset management business share a common investment orientation towards fundamental security selection 
our overall investment philosophy is focused on achieving a superior risk adjusted return by investing in companies that generate free cash flow 
we believe this style tends to outperform the market in some market environments and underperform it in others 
in particular  a prolonged growth environment ie  a prolonged period whereby growth stocks outperform value stocks may cause our investment strategy to go out of favor with some clients  consultants or third party intermediaries 
in combination with poor performance relative to peers  any changes in personnel  extensive periods in particular market environments  or other difficulties  may result in significant client or asset departures or a reduction in aum 
the significant growth we have experienced since inception may not be indicative of future growth 
our assets under management have increased from approximately billion at june  to approximately billion at june   and represents a significant rate of growth that may be difficult to sustain 
the growth of our business will depend on  among other things  our success in producing attractive returns in our investment strategies  our ability to expand our distribution capabilities  overall performance of the equity markets  our ability to deal with changing market conditions  our ability to maintain adequate financial and business controls  and our ability to comply with new legal and regulatory requirements 
because our clients can remove the assets we manage on short notice  we may experience unexpected declines in revenue and profitability 
our investment advisory and sub advisory contracts are generally cancellable upon very short notice 
institutional and individual clients  and firms with which we have strategic alliances  can terminate their relationship with use  reduce the aggregate amount of aum or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for a number of reasons including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market performance 
poor performance relative to other investment management firms may result in decreased inflows into our investment products  increased withdrawals from our investment products  and the loss of institutional or individual accounts or strategic alliances 
in addition  the ability to terminate relationships may allow clients to renegotiate for lower fees paid for asset management services 

table of contents in addition  in the us  as required by the investment advisers act  each of our investment advisory contracts with the mutual funds we advise or sub advise automatically terminates upon its assignment  or transfer of our responsibility for fund management 
each of our other investment advisory contracts subject to the provisions of the investment advisers act  as required by this act  provides that the contract may not be assigned without the consent of the customer 
a sale of a sufficiently large block of shares of our voting securities or other transactions could be deemed an assignment in certain circumstances 
an assignment  actual or constructive  will trigger these termination provisions and could adversely affect our ability to continue managing these client accounts 
to the extent that a technical assignment of investment advisory contracts arises  we will take the necessary steps to provide clients an opportunity to consent to the continuation of their advisory agreements 
such new agreements may need approval by the stockholders of the respective funds 
in the event that any of these clients do not consent to a renewal of their agreement  we could lose aum  which would result in a loss of revenue 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could lower our net income or negatively impact the portfolios of our clients and may affect the levels of our aum 
although most portfolios are in us dollar base currency  certain client portfolios are invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign currency fluctuations can adversely impact investment performance for a client s portfolio 
accordingly  foreign currency fluctuations may affect the levels of our aum 
as our aum includes assets that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to those non us currencies may result in a decrease in the dollar value of our aum  which  in turn  would result in lower us dollar denominated revenue in our business 
additionally  while this risk could be limited by foreign currency hedging  some risks cannot be hedged and there is no guarantee that our hedging activity would be successful 
access to clients through intermediaries is important to our asset management business  and reductions in referrals from such intermediaries or poor reviews of our products or our organization by such intermediaries could materially reduce our revenue and impair our ability to attract new clients 
our ability to market its services relies  in part  on receiving mandates from the client base of international and regional securities firms  banks  insurance companies  defined contribution plan administrators  investment consultants and other intermediaries 
to an increasing extent  our business uses referrals from accountants  lawyers  financial planners and other professional advisers 
the inability to have this access could materially adversely affect our business 
in addition  these intermediaries review and evaluate our products and our organization 
poor reviews or evaluations of either the particular products or of our company may result in client withdrawals or an inability to attract new assets through such intermediaries 
some members of management are critical to our success  and the inability to attract and retain key employees could compromise our future success 
if key employees were to leave the firm  whether to join a competitor or otherwise  we may experience a decline in revenue or earnings  which may have an adverse effect on our financial position 
loss of key employees may occur due to perceived opportunity for promotion  increased compensation  work environment or other individual reasons  some of which may be beyond our control 
except for our ceo  there are no employment agreements with any other key employees 
the loss of services of one or more key employees  or failure to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
table of contents could negatively impact the business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
as with other asset management businesses  future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of certain officers  portfolio managers and other key marketing  client service and management personnel 
there is substantial competition for these types of skilled personnel 
in order to attract or retain key personnel  we may be required to increase compensation 
compensation levels in the investment management industry are highly competitive and can fluctuate significantly from year to year 
our reputation is critical to our success 
as a financial services firm  we depend  to a large extent  on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for integrity and high caliber professional services 
any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel  and lead to a reduction in the amount of our assets under management 
additionally  there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry  and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur in our business  as well 
for example  misconduct by employees could involve the improper use or disclosure of confidential information  which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm 
in our business  we have discretion to trade client assets on the client s behalf and must do so acting in the best interest of the client 
as a result  we are subject to a number of obligations and standards  and the violation of those obligations or standards may adversely affect the company s clients and the company 
we have adopted and implemented a number of insider trading  code of ethics  and other related policies and procedures to address such obligations and standards 
it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct  and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases 
we derive more than of its operating revenue from one client 
pursuant to a strategic relationship with new york life investment management  eip is the sub advisor of several mutual funds within new york life investment management s mainstay group of funds 
as such  new york life investment management accounted for approximately of revenues for fy a loss of this client could negatively impact our operating revenues 
changes in fee levels or asset mix could reduce revenues and margins 
our profit margins and net income are dependent  in significant part  on our ability to maintain current fee levels for the products that we offer 
there has been a trend towards lower fees in some segments of the asset management industry and no assurances can be given that we will be able to maintain our current fee structure 
although our investment management fees vary from product to product  we compete primarily on the basis of our performance and not on the level of our investment management fees relative to those of our competitors 
in order to maintain our fee structure in a competitive environment  we must be able to continue to provide clients with investment returns and client service that incentivize our clients to pay our fees 
additionally  a shift in the mix in our assets under management from higher revenue generating assets to lower revenue generating assets may result in a decrease in revenues even if our aggregate level of assets under management remains unchanged or increases 
other operational risks may disrupt our business  result in regulatory action against us  or limit our growth 
our business is dependent on communications and information systems  including those of our vendors 
any failure or interruption of these systems  whether caused by fire  other natural disaster  power or telecommunications failure  act of terrorism or war or otherwise  could materially adversely 
table of contents affect our operating results 
although we have back up systems in place  our back up procedures and capabilities in the event of a failure or interruption may not be adequate 
we rely heavily on our financial  accounting  trading  compliance and other data processing systems 
if any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled  we could suffer financial loss  a disruption of our business  liability to its clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses 
we expect that we will need to continue to upgrade and expand these capabilities in the future to avoid disruption of  or constraints on  our operations 
we may be exposed to data security risks 
a failure to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of client data from the infiltration by an unauthorized user that is either stored on or transmitted between our information systems or to other third party service provider systems may lead to modifications or theft of critical and sensitive data pertaining to our clients 
the costs incurred to correct client data and prevent further unauthorized access could be extensive 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
various factors may prevent the declaration and payment of common stock dividends 
we began to pay a quarterly cash dividend  commencing in the quarter ended december  however  the payment of dividends in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors  and various other factors may prevent us from paying dividends 
our board of directors will take into account such matters as general business conditions  our financial results  and legal or regulatory restrictions 
we may pursue acquisitions or joint ventures that could present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs and could dilute the stock ownership of our stockholders 
we routinely assess our strategic position and may seek acquisitions or other transactions to further enhance our competitive position 
as part of our long term business strategy  we may pursue joint ventures and other transactions aimed at expanding the geography and scope of our operations 
we expect to explore partnership opportunities that we believe to be attractive 
if we are not correct when we assess the value  strengths and weaknesses  liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates or are not successful in integrating the operations of the acquired business  the success of the combined business could be compromised 
acquisitions and joint ventures involve a number of risks and present financial  managerial and operational challenges  including potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  difficulty with integrating personnel and financial and other systems  hiring additional management and other critical personnel and increasing the scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
our clients may react unfavorably to our acquisition and joint venture strategy  we may not realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions  and may be exposed to additional liabilities of any acquired business or joint venture  any of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
in addition  future acquisitions or joint ventures may involve the issuance of additional shares of our common stock  which would dilute our existing ownership 

table of contents certain changes in accounting and or financial reporting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  the sec or other standard setting bodies could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we are subject to the application of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which periodically are revised and or expanded 
as such  we periodically are required to adopt new or revised accounting and or financial reporting standards issued by recognized accounting standard setters or regulators  including the fasb and the sec 
it is possible that future requirements  including the recently proposed implementation of international financial reporting standards ifrs  could change our current application of gaap  resulting in a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
risks related to our industry we face strong competition from financial services firms  many of whom have the ability to offer clients a wider range of products and services than we can offer  which could lead to pricing pressures that could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
the financial services industry is intensely competitive and we expect it to remain so 
in addition to performance  we compete on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of our employees  transaction execution  our products and services  innovation  reputation and price 
we believe that we may experience pricing pressures in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain increased market share by reducing fees 
any event that negatively affects the asset management industry could have a material adverse impact on us 
any event affecting the asset management industry that results in a general decrease in aum or a significant general decline in the number of advisory clients or accounts could negatively impact revenues 
future growth and success depends  in part  upon favorable market conditions and the growth of the asset management industry 
extensive regulation of our business limits our activities and results in ongoing exposure to the potential for significant penalties  including fines or limitations on our ability to conduct its business 
the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation 
we are subject to regulation by governmental and self regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world 
many of these regulators  including us and us government agencies and self regulatory organizations  as well as state securities commissions in the us  are empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure  fine  the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of an investment adviser 
the requirements imposed by our regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with us and are not designed to protect our stockholders 
consequently  these regulations often serve to limit our activities  including customer protection and market conduct requirements 
we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities  including extended investigation and surveillance activity  adoption of costly or restrictive new regulations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties 
in addition  the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to modifications and further regulation 
new laws  regulations  or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our company and our clients may also adversely affect our business  and our ability to function in this environment will depend on our ability to constantly monitor and react to these changes 
in addition  the regulatory environment in which our clients operate may impact our business 
for example  changes in antitrust 
table of contents laws or the enforcement of antitrust laws could affect the level of mergers and acquisitions activity and changes in state laws may limit investment activities of state pension plans 
instances of criminal activity and fraud by participants in the asset management industry  disclosures of trading and other abuses by participants in the financial services industry  and the recent massive governmental intervention and investment in the financial markets and financial firms have lead the us government and regulators to increase the rules and regulations governing  and oversight of  the us financial system 
the cumulative effect of these actions may result in increased expenses  or lower management fees  and therefore  adversely affect the revenues or profitability of our business 
in addition  financial services firms are subject to numerous conflicts of interests or perceived conflicts  have adopted various policies  controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts and regularly seeks to review and update our policies  controls and procedures 
these policies and procedures may result in increased costs  additional operational personnel  and increased regulatory risk 
failure to adhere to our policies and procedures could result in regulatory sanctions or client litigation 
specific regulatory changes may also have a direct impact on the revenue of our asset management business 
in addition to regulatory scrutiny and potential fines and sanctions  regulators continue to examine different aspects of the asset management industry 
these regulatory changes and other proposed or potential changes may result in a reduction of revenue associated with asset management 
the financial services industry faces substantial litigation and regulatory risks 
in recent years  the volume of claims and amount of damages claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial advisers has been increasing 
in our business  we make investment decisions on behalf of our clients which could result in substantial losses 
this may subject us to the risk of legal liabilities or actions alleging negligent misconduct  breach of fiduciary duty or breach of contract 
these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
our engagements typically include broad indemnities from our clients and provisions designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services  but these provisions may not protect us or may not be adhered to in all cases 
we may also be subject to claims arising from disputes with employees for alleged discrimination or harassment  among other things 
these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify  and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
as a result  we may incur significant legal expenses in defending against litigation 
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us  which could seriously harm our business 
due to the extensive laws and regulations to which we are subject  management is required to devote substantial time and effort to legal and regulatory compliance issues 
in addition  the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change 
we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations
