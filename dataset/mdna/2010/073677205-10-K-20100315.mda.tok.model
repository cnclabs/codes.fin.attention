overview we completed the move to the tyngsboro facility in january  and we have completed the first phase build out of our manufacturing facility 
we now have a facility capable of producing up to flywheels per year 
we have a second phase manufacturing build out planned which will increase the annual manufacturing capacity to more than  flywheels 
on november   we began to provide mw of frequency regulation service through the iso ne pilot program 
we added a second mw of capacity in july  and third in december our flywheel system has been on line for of the time  on average  since january   and is earning revenue from frequency regulation services 
during  we plan to hire approximately new employees at our tyngsboro  massachusetts  headquarters  including hardware engineers  project managers  market data analysts  and sales directors both us and international  as well as positions in purchasing  finance  site development  manufacturing and production 
this workforce expansion will enable us to ramp up production of our grid scale flywheel energy storage systems  which will be installed in our mw plant in stephentown  new york  now under construction 
a portion of this plant is expected to begin earning revenue by providing frequency regulation in the fourth quarter of the decision to expand our workforce comes following a series of positive events in  including more than a full year of operation on the new england grid  a million conditional loan guarantee commitment from the us department of energy doe  and the award of a million doe smart grid stimulus grant 
we also raised million in equity investment in december  a portion of which will provide the remaining capital required to close the doe loan 
from inception through december   we have incurred losses of approximately million 
we currently do not expect to become cash flow positive until we have deployed a sufficient number of merchant plants and or sold turnkey systems 
revenue our revenue during came primarily from three sources research and development contracts from government agencies  for which revenue has been recognized using the percentage of completion method frequency regulation service revenue from the iso ne pilot program sales of inverters and accessories 
our business plan anticipates earning revenue primarily from the provision of frequency regulation service and the sale of turnkey flywheel systems 
however  in the past  we have earned revenue from research and development contracts with government agencies 
in  we derived approximately of our revenue from our research and development contracts  two of those contracts accounted for of our total revenue 
in  since most of our development contracts were completed in  our revenue was substantially less than in  and less than of our revenue was derived from our research and development contracts 
in  of our revenue was from our research and development contracts and from the iso ne pilot program 
we also earned approximately  from the sale of aps clean energy credits in  and we expect to continue to earn limited revenues from the sale of aps certificates or similar credits in the future 
in addition  we have a small inventory of inverters and accessories that we sell  although that revenue is insignificant 
the revenue earned from frequency regulation services from the pilot program in was lower than would be expected in the future for three reasons the revenues we are currently receiving from this pilot program are less than those that we expect to receive under permanent market rules because  under iso ne s pilot program market rules  we are not eligible for marginal unit opportunity cost payments  which represent approximately one third of the revenue received by conventional regulating generators 
we believe that when iso ne adopts its permanent market rules for storage resources  they will either adjust the rules to include the marginal unit s opportunity cost in the clearing price or include a payment component for regulation pricing approximately equal to opportunity cost 
this change is consistent with all other iso markets  and would send the correct market signals to operators with lower cost technologies  such as flywheels 
the initial flywheels ran hotter than specification limits and during operation needed to be taken offline until they were back in normal operating range 
this reduced our effective capacity and revenue 
during  we redesigned and replaced the motor generators in our flywheels to resolve the temperature issue 
the more recent flywheels operate with no overheating and do not negatively impact our capacity 
until april  the pilot resource was sent a regulation signal that was similar to one for a traditional generator and therefore did not recognize that our technology provides regulation in a different manner than a traditional generator 
the traditional generator signal led to long periods of constant injections or withdrawals because it did not incorporate the amount of energy stored in the device in the dispatch algorithm 
after discussions with iso ne  in may  we convinced the iso to implement a regulation dispatch signal for our pilot project that better recognizes our system s unique capabilities and is similar to the dispatch method developed by nyiso which incorporates our energy level in the dispatch signal 
we are continuing to work with iso ne to implement a nyiso style dispatch signal in the permanent rules at the conclusion of the pilot program 
all iso s either will allow us to dispatch our resource based on its stored energy level nyiso  miso  pjm  or are considering incorporating this feature in their permanent market design caiso 
this new dispatch signal has improved the economics of our energy storage resources  but still does not give us the same capacity utilization that we expect under the nyiso dispatch system 
the lower capacity for the current assets is a combination of the iso ne pilot signal and our current operational strategy in new england 
iso ne is the only market with a pay for performance aspect to their compensation formula 
in order to maximize our total revenue and offset for the lower price from iso ne we have selected dispatch parameters that results in a low regulation capacity value but increases the amount of regulation service provided 
this trade off between capacity and mileage payments is unique to iso ne 
new york s compensation mechanism is completely based off of the regulation capacity value  and we will pursue an operational strategy to maximize that value at our stephentown plant 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold on fixed price research and development contracts is predominantly being recorded on the percentage of completion method and consists primarily of direct labor and material  subcontracting and associated overhead costs 
cost of goods sold for frequency regulation services consists of the cost of energy 
cost of goods sold does not reflect the true cost of any inverter sales  because our inverter inventory was fully written off during a prior year 
although our gross margin for regulation services for the iso ne pilot program for the months ended december   is negative  we earned a positive margin of approximately for the second half of our connection to the grid was made through national grid distribution lines  rather than directly to the iso through transmission lines  due to cost and time factors 
consequently  from november through april  we paid the retail price for our gross withdrawals from the grid  instead of paying the wholesale price only for the net electricity used  plus retail transmission and distribution charges 
in late april  iso ne and our local distribution company implemented a change which reduced our commodity cost of electricity by netting the electricity withdrawn and injected into the grid  and billing for that net usage at the wholesale rate 
in addition  a new regulation dispatch signal implemented by iso ne in may has reduced the amount of net electricity we need to purchase 
we are still paying retail transmission and distribution charges 
the cost of electricity will be even further reduced for our mw facilities  as we plan to be connected to transmission level rather than to distribution level power lines  and thus will not be subject to transmission and distribution fees 
those fees have represented approximately of our cost of energy for the last half of pro forma gross margin for the second half of  calculated without transmission or distribution charges  would have been approximately selling  general and administrative expenses our selling expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  related business development expenses and regulatory compliance efforts 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits related to our corporate staff  professional fees  insurance and travel 
in  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately over in  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately over  primarily due to increased legal and professional fees associated with regulatory activity and continued work on the doe loan program  higher compensation costs due in part to the hiring of a director of regulatory and market affairs and a director of human resources  higher equity based compensation costs and increased use of subcontractors and consultants 
overall  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal to be higher than in primarily due to increased staffing as we ramp up to construct and operate the stephentown site  replace our enterprise resource planning erp system and identify and develop additional sites 
research and development operations and maintenance in and prior years  amounts reported as research and development r d included not only the cost of our engineering staff  but also the cost of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead  since most of our activities related to development of the smart energy flywheel and smart energy matrix 
in  we substantially completed development of the smart energy matrix and began limited production of commercial units and building our first frequency regulation installations 
as of january   we have split the cost of operations and maintenance o m from the cost of our r d functions 
since our current production levels are still well below our facility s full capacity  o m costs for the year ended december   include a significant amount of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead 
in addition  costs associated with running the mw resource for the iso ne pilot program  and certain non fungible costs associated with certain smart energy matrix installations  are also included in o m 
r d represents the cost of compensation and benefits for research and development staff  as well as materials and supplies used in the engineering design and development process 
on a combined basis consistent with reporting in prior years  total o m and r d costs for were approximately  or lower than during the decrease is primarily due to lower legal costs  and reduced material expenses  subcontractor costs and stock compensation expense 
in  we substantially completed development of the smart energy matrix and began limited production of commercial units and building our first frequency regulation installations 
r d costs during were approximately higher than during the same period in  due to legal and professional fees  higher material costs  higher salary and benefit costs related to headcount increases to support engineering development and testing as well as manufacturing  higher facility costs and moving expenses and increased use of consultants and contractors 
in  we worked to develop at least two suppliers capable of producing each component of the smart energy matrix  and consequently  we incurred substantial tooling and material costs  some of which was paid on a best efforts basis to suppliers who were unable to meet our specifications 
these costs were expensed 
we also expensed approximately  for material  outside contractors  labor  overhead and interest related to the construction of the non fungible portions of the system at our tyngsboro location for the iso ne pilot program 
we expect r d expenses in to be higher than in due to efforts to reduce the cost of the smart energy matrix and modify our systems to operate at hz for use outside the united states 
likewise  o m expenses will increase in as we ramp up our production capacity and begin to operate and maintain the stephentown facility 
although installation of the full mw capacity in stephentown is not expected to be completed until the end of the second quarter of  we expect to begin to generate revenue from a portion of that site during the fourth quarter of loss on contract commitments in  we completed all but one of our existing contracts at a lower cost than had been previously expected  and recorded a credit against previously recognized contract losses of approximately in april  we were awarded a subcontract to provide a flywheel energy storage system in support of a wind integration research and development project in tehachapi  california  sponsored by the california energy commission 
we will receive approximately  to offset r d expenses and will contribute an additional  of engineering resources for the project  bringing the r d total to approximately  accordingly  we recorded a charge of approximately  to the contract loss reserve during to reflect the expected cost share portion of the tehachapi contract 
during the first quarter of  we increased the loss reserve for the tehachapi contract by  bringing the total contract loss to  this increase is based on the difference between the overhead rate that was bid on this fixed price contract and our forecasted overhead rate 
during the fourth quarter of  we began work on the pacific northwest national laboratory pnnl contract 
according to the terms of the contract  we expect to incur r d costs of approximately  and to receive approximately  to offset those costs 
accordingly  we recorded a charge of approximately  for our cost share portion of this contract 
the pnnl contract expires on march  as of late february  caiso had not provided the control signal test data required to complete the project 
pnnl has requested a contract extension from the bpa 
if the extension is not granted  we may be unable to complete the scope of work included in the contract  and therefore both our revenue and our costs may be less than initially estimated 
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization is primarily related to depreciation on capital expenditures  the amortization of lease and leasehold costs related to our facilities and the amortization of deferred loan costs 
depreciation and amortization expense will increase substantially in future periods as we build and deploy our frequency regulation installations 
interest and other income expense  net in  and  non operating income consisted primarily of interest income resulting from cash on hand 
interest income for was substantially lower than in due to lower cash balances available for investing and substantially lower interest rates 
approximately and  were received in and  respectively  in settlement of a class action suit relating to unfair practices engaged in by certain insurance brokerage firms 
losses of approximately  and and a gain of approximately  related to the sales of fixed assets were recognized in  and  respectively 
in addition  we had a gain of approximately  in from a freight claim  which was partially offset by a currency exchange loss of approximately  interest expense in and related to the massdev loan 
interest expense includes the amortization of warrants that were issued in conjunction with the loan of approximately  in addition  we capitalized approximately  in interest 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates our estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  asset impairments  inventory valuation  warranty reserves and other assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition although we have shipped products and recorded contract and frequency regulation service revenues  our operations have not yet reached a level that would qualify us to emerge from the development stage 
therefore we continue to be accounted for as a development stage company under financial accounting standards board s fasb s accounting standards codification asc topic  development stage entities 
frequency regulation service revenue revenue from service transactions is recognized when it has been earned and is realized or realizable 
revenue from services is earned either as the services are performed or when they are complete  and is considered realizable once the customer has committed to pay for the services and the customer s ability to pay is not in doubt 
frequency regulation service revenue is calculated on an hourly basis  as services are provided  based on formulas specific to the tariffs in effect at the applicable iso at bid award rates that are published by the iso 
in general  we recognize as revenue the amounts reported by the iso 
government contract revenue recognized on the percentage of completion method we recognize contract revenues using the percentage of completion method 
we use labor hours as the basis for the percentage of completion calculation  which is measured principally by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total labor hours for each contract at completion 
changes to total estimated contract costs or losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed are classified as current assets  and included in unbilled costs on contracts in process in our balance sheets 
amounts billed to clients in excess of revenues recognized to date are classified as current liabilities under advance billings on contracts 
changes in project performance and conditions  estimated profitability  and final contract settlements may result in future revisions to construction contract costs and revenue 
all of our research and development contracts are subject to cost review by the respective contracting agencies 
our reported results from these contracts could change adversely as a result of these reviews 
product sales we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
generally  revenue is recognized on transfer of title  typically when products are shipped  and all related costs are estimable 
for sales to distributors  we make an adjustment to defer revenue until products are subsequently sold by distributors to their customers 
loss on contract commitments our contracts have been primarily for the development of demonstration units of new products  the design of a frequency regulation facility or alternative uses for our flywheels 
as such  the work has supported our core research and development efforts 
we establish reserves for anticipated losses on contract commitments if  based on our cost estimates to complete the commitment  we determine that the cost to complete the contract will exceed the total expected contract revenue 
excluding the navsea contract  most of our contracts have been granted on a cost share basis  for which the expected cost share is recorded as a contract loss 
additionally  each quarter we perform an evaluation of expected costs to complete our in progress contracts and adjust the contract loss reserve accordingly 
inverter inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of actual cost or the current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
we have a limited amount of inventory related to our inverter product line  for which reserves were recorded in prior years 
these impairment charges were made due to the uncertainty of realizing any future value from the inventory due to the lack of substantial revenues to date from our inverter product line 
accordingly  for the years ended december  and  the value of our inverter product line inventory was fully offset by these reserves 
patent costs we capitalize external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents where we believe it is likely that the patent has a future economic value to us 
we monitor the legal costs incurred and the anticipated outcome of the legal action and  if changes in the anticipated outcome occur  capitalized costs will be adjusted in the period the change is determined 
patent costs are amortized over the remaining life of the patents 
we own intellectual property in the form of patents on our flywheel vacuum system  our heat pipe cooling systems  direct current output paralleling  metal hub  low loss motor  co mingled rims and earthquake tolerant bearings on our flywheel products  and anti islanding software  drawings  source code  and production know how on our inverter products  and expect to obtain other patents during and beyond 
in december  we recorded impairment charges to write down our capitalized patent costs to zero  due to the lack of substantial revenues to date and the uncertainty of realizing any future value from these patents 
accordingly  all costs incurred from through related to the development of intellectual property were expensed as incurred 
however  as we have now begun to commercialize our technology  as of  legal costs associated with obtaining patents which we expect to have future commercial value have been capitalized and will be amortized over the life of the patent 
we review our intangible assets periodically for impairment  and record impairment reserves as appropriate 
costs for patents that have not yet been issued are capitalized  but we do not begin to amortize them until such time as the patent is issued 
if we determine that a patent will not be issued  any previously capitalized costs are expensed 
warranty reserves the solar inverters we have sold carry warranties that require us to repair or replace defective products returned to us during the year warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs based on actual historical return rates  anticipated return rates and repair costs at the time of sale 
should we sell our smart energy matrix systems in the future  it is likely that the terms of sale will include a warranty 
in that event  we will estimate the repair costs under the terms of the warranty  and record an initial provision for warranty costs that we will adjust periodically based on actual results and anticipated future costs at that time 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reduce our current valuation allowance which could materially impact our tax provision 
we classify interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
property and equipment property and equipment in service is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
property and equipment are defined as tangible items with unit costs exceeding our capitalization threshold that are used in the operation of the business  are not intended for resale and which have a useful life of one year or more 
the cost of fixed assets is defined as the purchase price of the item  as well as all of the costs necessary to bring it to the condition and location necessary for its intended use 
these costs include such items as labor  overhead  capitalized interest and  if applicable  exit costs 
exit costs for which we are obligated are accounted for in accordance with asc topic  asset retirement and environmental obligations 
no overhead is generally applied for internally constructed projects not directly related to our core business eg  leasehold improvements 
interest costs incurred during the construction of major capital projects such as the construction of our frequency regulation plants are capitalized in accordance with asc topic  subtopic  interest capitalization of interest 
the interest is capitalized until the underlying asset is ready for its intended use  and is considered an integral part of the total cost of acquiring a qualifying asset 
thus  the capitalized interest costs are included in the calculation of depreciation expense once the constructed assets are in service 
repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
materials used in our development efforts are considered research and development materials  and are expensed as incurred in accordance with asc topic  research and development 
capital assets are classified as construction in progress cip when initially acquired  and reclassified to the appropriate asset account when placed into service  with the exception of land  which is capitalized upon purchase 
depreciation expense is not recorded on assets not yet placed into service 
materials purchased to build flywheels  power electronics and other components used in our frequency regulation installations are classified as cip  along with the related labor and overhead costs 
some components of the smart energy matrix  such as the flywheels and power electronics  are considered fungible in that they can be moved and redeployed at a different location 
other costs are sunk costs which would not be recovered if we redeployed the system or portions thereof 
in some cases  we may elect to deploy a smart energy matrix system at a location for the purpose of demonstrating our technology or gaining experience operating in that particular market 
in these instances  the costs of the fungible components are capitalized  and the remaining costs  which may include such costs as site preparation  interconnection costs  capitalized interest and estimated exit costs  are expensed 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with asc topic  property  plant and equipment  long lived assets are reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the conditions to be considered include whether or not the asset is in service  has become obsolete  is damaged  or whether external market circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when appropriate  we recognize a loss for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset and the carrying amount  or the cost to repair the asset 
the fair value of the asset is measured using either available market prices or estimated discounted cash flows 
in certain instances  we may determine that it is in the best interest of the company to re deploy all or part of a smart energy matrix system installed at a given location 
when such a determination has been made  we will determine which costs are associated with the movable fungible components  and which costs are non fungible 
we will record a period expense for the net book value not associated with the fungible components 
based on our annual analysis  no asset impairment charges were considered necessary for  or other assets and deferred financing costs we will defer our direct costs incurred to raise capital 
direct costs include only out of pocket or incremental costs directly related to the effort  such as a finder s fee and fees paid to outside consultants for accounting  legal or engineering investigations or for appraisals 
these costs will be charged to additional paid in capital when the efforts are successful  or expensed when unsuccessful 
indirect costs are expensed as incurred 
advance billings on contracts we may receive performance based payments and progress payments from customers which may exceed costs incurred on certain contracts  including contracts with agencies of the us government 
such advances are classified as current liabilities
