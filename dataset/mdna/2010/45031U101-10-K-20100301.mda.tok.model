these historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance 
we reclassified certain items in our consolidated financial statements of prior years to conform to our current year s presentation 
introduction istar financial inc is a publicly traded finance company focused on the commercial real estate industry 
we primarily provide custom tailored financing to high end private and corporate owners of real estate  including senior and mezzanine real estate debt  senior and mezzanine corporate capital  as well as corporate net lease financing and equity 
we are taxed as a real estate investment trust  or reit and provide innovative and value added financing solutions to our customers 
we deliver customized financial products to sophisticated real estate borrowers and corporate customers who require a high level of flexibility and service 
our two primary lines of business are lending and corporate tenant leasing 
the lending business is primarily comprised of senior and mezzanine real estate loans that typically range in size from million to million and have original terms generally ranging from three to ten years 
these loans may be either fixed rate based on the us treasury rate plus a spread or variable rate based on libor plus a spread and are structured to meet the specific financing needs of the borrowers 
we also provide senior and subordinated capital to corporations  particularly those engaged in real estate or real estate related businesses 
these financings may be either secured or unsecured  typically range in size from million to million and have initial maturities generally ranging from three to ten years 
as part of the lending business  we also acquire whole loans  loan participations and debt securities which present attractive risk reward opportunities 
our corporate tenant leasing business provides capital to corporations and other owners who control facilities leased to single creditworthy customers 
our net leased assets are generally mission critical headquarters or distribution facilities that are subject to long term leases with public companies  many of which are rated corporate credits 
most of the leases provide for expenses at the facility to be paid by the 
table of contents corporate customer on a triple net lease basis 
corporate tenant lease  or ctl  transactions have initial terms generally ranging from to years and typically range in size from million to million 
our primary sources of revenues are interest income  which is the interest that borrowers pay on loans  and operating lease income  which is the rent that corporate customers pay to lease our ctl properties 
we primarily generate income through the spread or margin  which is the difference between the revenues generated from loans and leases and interest expense and the cost of ctl operations 
we began our business in through private investment funds and became publicly traded in since that time  we have grown through the origination of new lending and leasing transactions  as well as through corporate acquisitions  including the acquisition of trinet corporate realty trust  inc in  the acquisitions of falcon financial investment trust and of a significant non controlling interest in oak hill advisors  lp and affiliates in  and the acquisition of the commercial real estate lending business and loan portfolio which we refer to as the fremont cre  of fremont investment and loan  or fremont  a division of fremont general corporation  in executive overview the financial market conditions that began in late  including the economic recession and tightening of credit markets  continued to significantly impact the commercial real estate market and financial services industry in the severe economic downturn led to a decline in commercial real estate values  which  combined with a lack of available debt financing for commercial and residential real estate assets  limited borrowers ability to repay or refinance their loans 
further  the ability of many of our borrowers to sell units in residential projects has been adversely impacted by current economic conditions and the lack of end loan financing available to residential unit purchasers 
the combination of these factors adversely affected our business  financial condition and operating performance in  resulting in significant additions to non performing assets  increases in the related provision for loan losses and a reduction in the level of liquidity available to finance our operations 
these economic factors and their effect on our operations have resulted in increases in our financing costs  a continuing inability to access the unsecured debt markets  depressed prices for our common stock  the continued suspension of quarterly common stock dividends and has narrowed our margin of compliance with debt covenants 
during the year ended  we incurred a net loss of million on million of revenue 
these financial results primarily resulted from a provision for loan losses of billion and impairments of other assets of million  which were recognized during the year 
the provision for loan losses was driven by an increase in non performing loans to billion  or of managed loan value as defined below in risk management as of december   compared to billion  or of managed loan value at december  the increase in non performing loans resulted from the continued deterioration in the commercial and residential real estate markets and weakened economic conditions impacting our borrowers  who continue to have difficulty servicing their debt and refinancing or selling their projects in order to repay their loans in a timely manner 
in addition  the balance of our real estate held for investment rehi and other real estate owned oreo assets have increased from million as of december  to billion as of december   as we have obtained title to properties through foreclosure or through deed in lieu of foreclosure as part of our effort to resolve non performing loans 
the losses were partially offset by the repurchase of billion par value of senior unsecured notes resulting in the recognition of million in net gains on the early extinguishment of debt 
our primary recourse debt instruments include our secured and unsecured bank credit facilities and our secured and unsecured public debt securities 
we believe we are in full compliance with all the covenants in those debt instruments as of december   however  our recent financial results have put pressure on our ability to maintain compliance with certain of the debt covenants in our secured bank credit facilities 
in particular  our tangible net worth at december  is not significantly above the 
table of contents financial covenant minimum requirement 
we intend to operate our business in order to remain in compliance with the covenants in our debt instruments  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
a failure by us to satisfy a financial covenant in a debt instrument could trigger a default under that debt instrument and could give the lenders the ability to accelerate the debt if the default is not waived or cured 
most of our recourse debt instruments contain cross default and or cross acceleration provisions that may be triggered by defaults or accelerations of our recourse debt above specified thresholds 
from a liquidity perspective  we expect to continue to experience significant uncertainty with respect to our sources of funds 
our cash flow may be affected by a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control  including volatility in the financial markets  our borrowers ability to repay their obligations and other general business conditions 
as of december   we had million of unrestricted cash 
for the upcoming year  we will require significant capital to repay million of our debt maturities and to fund our investment activities and operating expenses  including approximately million of unfunded commitments primarily associated with our construction loan portfolio 
in addition  under the terms of our first priority credit agreement  if we do not pay down the outstanding balance of that loan by million by september   payments of principal and net sale proceeds received by us in respect of assets constituting collateral for our obligations under this agreement must be applied toward the mandatory prepayment of the loan and commitment reductions under the agreement 
we expect to need additional liquidity over the coming year to supplement expected loan repayments and cash generated from operations in order to meet our debt maturities and funding obligations 
during  we utilized our unencumbered assets to generate additional liquidity through secured financing transactions and a secured note exchange transaction  and also sold various assets 
in addition  we have significantly curtailed our asset origination activities  reduced operating expenses and focused on asset management in order to maximize recoveries from existing asset resolutions 
we intend to utilize all available sources of funds in today s financing environment  which could include additional financings secured by our assets  increased levels of asset sales  joint ventures and other third party capital to meet our liquidity requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will possess sufficient liquidity to meet all of our debt service requirements in in addition we are exploring various alternatives to enable us to meet our significant debt maturities 
the failure to execute such alternatives successfully prior to debt maturities would have material adverse consequences on us 
we have reacted to market conditions and liquidity and debt covenant pressures by implementing various initiatives that we believe will guide us through the difficult business conditions which we expect to persist through our public debt securities continue to trade at significant discounts to par 
we have been able to partially mitigate the impact of the decline in operating results through the recognition of gains associated with the repurchase and retirement of debt at a discount  which has contributed to our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and has enabled us to reduce outstanding indebtedness at discounts to par 
we expect to continue to use available funds and other strategies to seek to retire our debt at a discount  however  there can be no assurance that our efforts in this regard will be successful 
our plan is dynamic and we expect to adjust our plan as market conditions change 
if we are unable to successfully implement our plan  our cash flows  debt covenant compliance  financial position and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

table of contents results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  change change in thousands interest income operating lease income other income total revenue interest expense operating costs corporate tenant lease assets depreciation and amortization general and administrative provision for loan losses impairment of other assets impairment of goodwill other expense total costs and expenses gain on early extinguishment of debt gain on sale of joint venture interest earnings from equity method investments income loss from discontinued operations gain from discontinued operations net loss revenue the significant decline in interest income year over year is primarily a result of a decrease in the carrying value of performing loans to billion at the end of from billion at the end of in addition to having assets move from performing to non performing status see risk management for additional discussion of non performing loans  we also had loan repayments and sales that contributed to the decline in income generating loans 
lower interest rates also contributed to the decline in interest income with one month libor averaging in versus in the impact of declining rates on loans has been tempered by interest rate floors  resulting in a weighted average interest rate of in effect on approximately billion of loans at december  the year over year change in other income was primarily driven by certain one time transactions in including million of income recognized from the redemption of a participation interest in a lending investment and million of income recognized when we exchanged a cost method equity investment for a loan receivable 
additionally  other loan related income  such as prepayment penalties  declined by million from to slightly offsetting this increase were million of realized and unrealized gains on trading securities held in our other investment portfolio 
operating lease income from our ctl assets has remained relatively consistent year over year 
costs and expenses increases in provisions for loan losses and other expenses were more than offset by fewer asset impairments and lower interest expense and general and administrative expenses to result in an overall decrease in costs and expenses 
as noted above and discussed further in risk management and executive overview  increases in our provisions for loan losses were caused by the continued deterioration in the commercial real estate market and weakened economic conditions that have negatively impacted our borrowers ability to service their debt and refinance their loans at maturity 
this has resulted in additional asset specific reserves due 
table of contents to the increasing level of non performing loans within the portfolio along with declining values of real estate collateral that secure such loans 
impairment charges relating to certain of our securities and equity investments were million lower in as compared to these assets include available for sale and held to maturity investments that were determined to be other than temporarily impaired based on having trading prices below our carrying values 
also included in were million of impairments of finite lived intangible assets  to reduce their carrying values to their revised estimated fair values 
these decreases were offset by million of higher ctl impairments of which million was reclassified to income from discontinued operations caused by deteriorating sub market conditions and lower than expected rents in certain areas 
impairments of oreo assets also increased by million to reduce certain assets to their revised estimated fair values less costs to sell 
deteriorating market conditions also led to impairment charges related to goodwill 
in  we recorded a million impairment charge to eliminate the goodwill in our real estate lending reporting unit 
in  we recorded million further impairments to reduce the goodwill related to our corporate tenant leasing reporting unit to zero 
the significant decline in interest expense year over year is primarily a result of reducing our outstanding debt balances from repurchases and repayments 
in an effort to generate gains on certain of our debt securities which have traded at discounts to par  as discussed further below  we repurchased billion par value of our senior unsecured notes during and we also repaid an additional million at maturity 
in addition  we completed an exchange of senior unsecured notes for new second lien senior secured notes in may  further described in liquidity and capital resources 
this exchange resulted in a million deferred gain reflected as a premium to the new notes which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the terms of the new notes 
in  we recognized million in amortization of this premium as a reduction to interest expense 
lower libor rates also contributed to our decrease in interest expense  with our average borrowing rates decreasing to in from in general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll and employee related costs from reductions in headcount 
other expense was higher primarily due to a million charge incurred during pursuant to a settlement agreement under which we terminated a long term lease for new headquarters space and settled all disputes with a landlord 
the remaining increase in other expense primarily relates to additional holding costs associated with the increasing number of oreo and rehi properties during the year 
gain on early extinguishment of debt in  we retired billion par value of our senior unsecured notes though open market repurchases at discounts to par and recognized million in gain on early extinguishment of debt 
additionally we completed our secured note exchange transactions and purchased million of our outstanding senior floating rates notes in a cash tender offer  which resulted in an aggregate net gain on early extinguishment of debt of million 
during  we retired million par value of our senior unsecured notes through open market repurchases at discounts to par which resulted in an aggregate net gain on early extinguishment of debt of million 
gain on sale of joint venture interest in april  we closed on the sale of our timberstar southwest joint venture for a gross sales price of billion  including the assumption of debt 
we received net proceeds of million for our interest in the venture and recorded a gain of million 
income loss from discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations in included impairment charges of million on ctl assets sold during the year or held for sale at the end of the year 
in  income loss from discontinued operations included higher operating results for ctl and timberstar assets sold or classified as held for sale in and 
table of contents gain from discontinued operations during  we sold four ctl assets and recognized gains of million 
during  we sold several ctl assets and our maine timber property for gains of million 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the years ended december  change change in thousands interest income operating lease income other income total revenue interest expense operating costs corporate tenant lease assets depreciation and amortization general and administrative provision for loan losses impairment of other assets impairment of goodwill other expense total costs and expenses gain on early extinguishment of debt gain on sale of joint venture interest earnings from equity method investments income from discontinued operations gain from discontinued operations net income loss revenue we experienced a decline in interest income in as compared to primarily relating to increased non performing loans  which was partially offset by the inclusion of a full year of interest income in from the loans acquired from fremont  compared to only six months of income in at the end of  the carrying value of performing loans declined to billion from billion at the end of  primarily as a result of assets moving to non performing status 
this was a result of the deterioration in the commercial real estate market and weakened economic conditions impacting our borrowers  who had difficulty servicing their debt and refinancing or selling their projects in order to repay their loans in a timely manner 
lower interest rates also contributed to the decline in interest income with an average one month libor of in versus in while other income was relatively flat year over year  certain one time transactions in resulted in higher income offset by a decrease in other loan related income  such as prepayment penalties 
in we recognized million of income from the redemption of a participation interest in a lending investment and million when we exchanged a cost method equity investment for a loan receivable 
operating lease income from our ctl assets has remained relatively consistent year over year 
costs and expenses total costs and expenses increased primarily due to significant provisions for loan losses and other asset impairment charges 

table of contents the increase in our provision for loan losses was primarily due to additional asset specific reserves that were required as a result of the significant increase in non performing loans during this significant increase  particularly in our residential land development and condominium construction portfolios  was driven by the weakening economy and the dislocation of the credit markets  which adversely impacted the ability of our borrowers to service their debt and refinance their loans at maturity 
impairment charges relating to certain of our securities and equity investments were million in as compared to million in these assets include available for sale and held to maturity investments that were determined to be other than temporarily impaired based on having trading prices below our carrying values 
other asset impairments in  which did not occur in the prior year  included million on oreo assets  million on finite lived intangible assets including assets acquired in the fremont acquisition  and million on ctl assets 
oreo and ctl asset impairments were also caused by deteriorating sub market conditions and lower than expected rents in surrounding areas 
deteriorating market conditions also led to the million impairment charge to eliminate goodwill in our real estate lending reporting unit in interest expense increased primarily due to higher average outstanding borrowings during  partially offset by decreased interest rates on our borrowings 
our average outstanding debt balance increased to billion in from billion in through new bond issuances in and  increased borrowings on our unsecured and secured revolving credit facilities as well as the new secured term loans 
higher borrowings were partially offset by lower average rates  which decreased to in as compared to in  primarily as a result of lower libor rates 
in relation to our ctl portfolio  depreciation and amortization increased as a result of the acquisition and construction of new ctl assets in while operating costs corporate tenant lease assets decreased primarily due to increased property expense recoveries from tenants leasing our properties 
other expense in included million primarily related to ineffectiveness associated with our various derivative instruments 
the remaining million related to costs associated with oreo properties that we took title to through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure in and the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to lower payroll and employee related costs resulting from a reduction in headcount from as of december  to as of december  gain on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december   we retired million par value of our senior unsecured notes through open market repurchases at discounts to par  resulting in an aggregate net gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately million 
gain on sale of joint venture interest in april  we closed on the sale of our timberstar southwest joint venture for a gross sales price of billion  including the assumption of debt 
we received net proceeds of approximately million for our interest in the venture and recorded a gain of million 
earnings from equity method investments during  losses were recorded on several of our equity method investments due to volatility in the financial markets and deteriorating economic conditions 
this was partially offset by the sale of our timberstar southwest joint venture  as described above 
our share of losses from this venture prior to the sale were million for the year ended december  compared to losses of million during the same period in income from discontinued operations for the years ended december  and  operating results for ctl and timberstar assets sold during the period through december  or assets held for sale at the end of are classified as discontinued operations 
the decrease in income from discontinued operations is primarily due to the inclusion of more income in for ctl and timberstar assets sold in  and 
table of contents gain from discontinued operations during the year ended december   we sold a portfolio of ctl assets to one buyer and also seventeen ctl assets to different buyers for net aggregate proceeds of million  and recognized gains of approximately million 
in addition  we also closed on the sale of our maine timber property for net proceeds of million resulting in a gain of million 
adjusted earnings we measure our performance using adjusted earnings in addition to net income 
adjusted earnings represent net income attributable to istar financial inc and allocable to common shareholders  hpu holders and participating security holders computed in accordance with gaap  before depreciation  depletion  amortization  gain from discontinued operations  ineffectiveness on interest rate hedges  impairments of goodwill and intangible assets and extraordinary items 
adjustments for joint ventures reflect our share of adjusted earnings calculated on the same basis 
we believe that adjusted earnings is a helpful measure to consider  in addition to net income  because this measure helps us to evaluate how our commercial real estate finance business is performing compared to other commercial finance companies  without the effects of certain gaap adjustments that are not necessarily indicative of current operating performance 
the most significant gaap adjustments that we exclude in determining adjusted earnings are depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets  which are typically non cash charges 
we do not exclude non cash impairment charges on tangible assets or provisions for loan loss reserves 
as a commercial finance company that focuses on real estate lending and corporate tenant leasing  we record significant depreciation on our real estate assets  and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our borrowings 
depreciation  depletion and amortization do not affect our daily operations  but they do impact financial results under gaap 
adjusted earnings is not an alternative or substitute for net income in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance 
rather  we believe that adjusted earnings is an additional measure that helps us analyze how our business is performing 
adjusted earnings should not be viewed as an alternative measure of either our operating liquidity or funds available for our cash needs or for distribution to our shareholders 
in addition  we may not calculate adjusted earnings in the same manner as other companies that use a similarly titled measure 
for the years ended december  in thousands adjusted earnings net income loss add depreciation  depletion and amortization add joint venture income add joint venture depreciation  depletion and amortization add amortization of deferred financing costs add impairment of goodwill and intangible assets less hedge ineffectiveness  net less gain from discontinued operations less gain on sale of joint venture interest less net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests less preferred dividend requirement adjusted diluted earnings loss attributable to istar financial  inc and allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders weighted average diluted common shares outstanding 
table of contents explanatory notes hpu holders are current or former company employees who purchased high performance common stock units under our high performance unit program 
participating security holders are company employees and directors who hold unvested restricted stock units and common stock equivalents granted under our long term incentive plan 
for the years ended december   and  adjusted diluted earnings loss attributable to istar financial inc and allocable to common shareholders  hpu holders and participating security holders includes   and  respectively  of adjusted earnings loss allocable to hpu holders 
for the years ended december  and  amounts exclude  and  respectively  of dividends paid to participating security holders 
risk management loan credit statistics the table below summarizes our non performing loans and details the reserve for loan losses associated with our loans as of december  non performing loans carrying value participated portion managed loan value as a percentage of managed loan value of total loans watch list loans carrying value participated portion managed loan value as a percentage of managed loan value of total loans reserve for loan losses as a percentage of managed loan value of total loans as a percentage of managed loan value of non performing loans other real estate owned carrying value real estate held for investment  net carrying value explanatory notes managed loan value of a loan is computed by adding our carrying value of the loan and the participation interest sold on the fremont cre portfolio 
the participation receives of all loan principal payments including principal that we have funded 
therefore we are in the first loss position and we believe that presentation of the managed loan value is more relevant than a presentation of our carrying value when discussing our risk of loss on the loans in the fremont cre portfolio 
managed loan value of total loans was  and  as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents as of december   non performing loans and oreo and rehi assets had the following collateral and property types in thousands collateral property type non performing loans oreo rehi total of total land condo construction completed construction in progress conversion mixed use mixed collateral entertainment leisure retail multifamily hotel office corporate real estate industrial r d other gross carrying value non performing loans we designate loans as non performing at such time as the loan becomes days delinquent  the loan has a maturity default  or management determines it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
all non performing loans are placed on non accrual status and income is only recognized in certain cases upon actual cash receipt 
as of december   we had non performing loans with an aggregate carrying value of billion and an aggregate managed loan value of billion  or of the managed loan value of total loans 
our non performing loans increased during  particularly in our residential land development and condominium construction portfolios  due to the weakened economy and the continued disruption in the credit markets  which adversely impacted the ability of many of our borrowers to service their debt and refinance our loans at maturity 
due to the continued deterioration of the commercial real estate market  the process of estimating collateral values and reserves will continue to require significant judgment on the part of management  which is inherently uncertain and subject to change 
management currently believes there is adequate collateral and reserves to support the carrying values of the loans 
watch list assets we conduct a quarterly credit review  resulting in an individual risk rating being assigned to each asset in our portfolio 
this review is designed to enable management to evaluate and manage asset specific credit issues and identify credit trends on a portfolio wide basis 
as of december   we had assets on the watch list  excluding non performing loans  with an aggregate carrying value of million and an aggregate managed loan value of million  or of total managed loan value 
reserve for loan losses during the year ended december   the reserve for loan losses increased million  which was the result of billion of provisioning for loan losses reduced by million of charge offs 
the reserve is increased through the provision for loan losses  which reduces income in the period recorded and the reserve is reduced through charge offs 
the reserve for loan losses includes an asset specific component and a formula based component 
an asset specific reserve is established for an impaired loan when the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral less costs to sell is lower than the carrying value of the loan 
as of december   we had 
table of contents asset specific reserves of billion or of non performing loans compared to asset specific reserves of million or of non performing loans at december  the increase in asset specific reserves during the year ended december  was primarily due to the increase in non performing loans as previously discussed 
the increase was also due to additional reserves required for existing non performing loans further impacted by the continued deterioration in the commercial real estate market 
the formula based general reserve is derived from estimated probabilities of principal loss and loss given default severities assigned to the portfolio during our quarterly internal risk rating assessment 
probabilities of principal loss and severity factors are based on industry and or internal experience and may be adjusted for significant factors that  based on our judgment  impact the collectability of the loans as of the balance sheet date 
the general reserve was million or of performing loans as of december  compared to million or of performing loans at december  real estate held for investment  net and other real estate owned during the year ended december   we received title to properties in full or partial satisfaction of non performing mortgage loans with a carrying value of billion  for which the properties had served as collateral  and recorded charge offs totaling million related to these loans 
of this total  we recorded properties with a carrying value of million to rehi and million to oreo based on our strategy to either hold the properties over a longer period or to market them for sale 
during the year ended december   we sold oreo assets for net proceeds of million and recorded impairment charges totaling million due to changing market conditions  which were included in impairment of other assets on our consolidated statements of operations 
tenant credit characteristics as of december   our ctl assets had different tenants  of which were public companies and were private companies 
in addition  of the tenants were rated investment grade by one or more national rating agencies  were rated non investment grade and the remaining tenants were not rated 
liquidity and capital resources for the upcoming year  we will require significant capital to repay million of our debt maturities and to fund our investment activities and operating expenses  including approximately million of unfunded commitments primarily associated with our construction loan portfolio 
however  the timing of funding these commitments and the amounts of the individual fundings are largely dependent on construction projects meeting certain milestones  and therefore they are difficult to predict with certainty 
in addition  under the terms of our first priority credit agreement  as discussed below  if we do not pay down the outstanding balance of that loan by million by september   payments of principal and net sale proceeds received by us in respect of assets constituting collateral for our obligations under this agreement must be applied toward the mandatory prepayment of the loan and commitment reductions under the agreement 
our capital sources in today s financing environment include repayments from our loan assets  asset sales  financings secured by our assets  cash flow from operations and potential joint ventures 
from a liquidity perspective  we expect to continue to experience significant uncertainty with respect to our sources of funds 
historically we have also issued unsecured corporate debt  convertible debt and preferred and common equity  however  current market conditions have effectively eliminated our access to these sources of capital in the near term 
in march  we obtained additional financing and consummated a restructuring of our existing unsecured revolving credit facilities by entering into new secured credit facilities the secured credit facilities transaction 
in connection with this transaction  we entered into a billion first priority credit agreement maturing in june that is secured by a pool of collateral consisting of loan assets  corporate tenant lease assets  securities and other assets 
we also entered into a billion second 
table of contents priority credit agreement maturing in june and a million second priority credit agreement maturing in june with the same lenders participating in the first priority credit agreement  who have a second lien on the same collateral pool 
refer to the credit facilities restructuring section below for further details on these transactions 
in may  we completed a series of private offers through which billion aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured notes of various series were exchanged for million aggregate principal amount of new second lien senior secured notes issued by us and guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries 
the new second lien notes have a second lien on the same collateral pool as the first and second priority credit agreements described above 
concurrent with the exchange offer  we repurchased for cash million par value of our outstanding senior floating rate notes due september pursuant to a cash tender offer 
during  we received gross principal repayments from borrowers of billion and billion in proceeds from strategic asset sales 
we funded billion of loan commitments during the year and repaid outstanding debt of billion partially offset by new borrowings of billion 
we also repurchased billion par value of senior unsecured notes resulting in the recognition of million in net gains on the early extinguishment of debt during the year 
to date  we have been able to partially mitigate the impact of increased expenses associated with our loan loss reserves on some of our financial covenants through the recognition of gains associated with the discounted extinguishment of debt 
we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase additional outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges  which may take the form of open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise  however  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts in this regard can be successful 
as of december   we had million of unrestricted cash 
we will need additional liquidity over the coming year to supplement loan repayments and cash generated from operations in order to meet our debt maturities and funding obligations 
we actively manage our liquidity and continually work on initiatives to address both our debt covenants compliance and our liquidity needs 
we expect proceeds from asset sales to supplement loan repayments and intend to continue to analyze additional asset sales  secured financing alternatives and other strategic transactions in order to maintain adequate liquidity 
during the first quarter of  we began exploring a sale or other transaction involving a portfolio of corporate tenant leased assets totaling approximately million square feet and representing approximately of the company s total corporate tenant leased net operating income 
the portfolio is encumbered by secured  non recourse term debt that matures in april any decision by us to sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of the portfolio will be based primarily on the pricing terms offered by interested parties 
there can be no assurance that any transaction involving all or part of the portfolio will be consummated 
under the terms of our credit agreements  we can issue a total of up to billion of second priority secured notes in exchange or refinancing transactions involving our unsecured notes 
after giving effect to the private exchange offers in may  described above  we can issue up to million of new notes in exchange or refinancing transactions 
our liquidity plan is dynamic and we expect to monitor the markets and adjust our plan as market conditions change 
there is a risk that we will not be able to meet all of our funding and debt service obligations or maintain compliance with our debt covenants 
management s failure to successfully implement our liquidity plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and covenant compliance  results of operations and cash flows 
compliance with our debt covenants will also impact our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing 
in addition  any decision by our lenders and investors to provide us with additional financing may depend upon a number of other factors  such as our compliance with the terms of existing credit arrangements  our financial performance  our credit ratings  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders and investors resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities

this amount has been included in years based on its contractual maturity 
all variable rate debt assumes a day libor rate of the day libor rate at december  
see off balance sheet transactions below  for a discussion of certain unfunded commitments related to our lending and ctl business 
credit facilities restructuring in march  we entered into a billion first priority credit agreement with participating members of our existing bank lending group 
the first priority credit agreement will mature in june borrowings bear interest at the rate of libor per year  subject to adjustment based upon our corporate credit ratings see ratings triggers below and are collateralized by a first priority lien on a pool of collateral consisting of loans  debt securities  corporate tenant lease assets and other assets pledged under the first and second priority credit agreements and the second priority secured exchange notes see below 
as of december   the first priority credit agreement was fully drawn with billion of secured term loans outstanding 
we also restructured our two unsecured revolving credit facilities by entering into two second priority credit agreements  with billion maturing in and million maturing in  with the same lenders participating in the first priority credit agreement 
such lenders commitments under the company s unsecured facilities have been terminated and replaced by their commitments under the second priority credit agreements 
under these agreements  the participating lenders have a second 
table of contents priority lien on the same collateral pool securing the first priority credit agreement and the second priority secured exchange notes see unsecured secured notes exchange below 
as of december   outstanding borrowings under the second priority credit agreements include million and million of revolving loans due in june and june  respectively  as well as billion and million of term loans due in june and june  respectively 
borrowings bear interest at the rate of libor per year  subject to adjustment based upon our corporate credit ratings see ratings triggers below 
as of december  there was approximately million that was immediately available to draw under the second priority credit agreement 
at december   the total carrying value of assets pledged as collateral under the first and second priority credit agreements and the second priority secured exchange notes was billion 
concurrently  we entered into amendments to our billion and billion unsecured revolving credit facilities 
as of december   after giving effect to the amendments  outstanding balances on the unsecured credit facilities were million  which will expire in june  and million  which will expire in june the amendments eliminated certain covenants and events of default 
the unsecured revolving credit facilities may not be repaid prior to maturity while the first and second priority credit agreements remain outstanding 
these facilities remain unsecured and no changes were made to the pricing terms of these facilities in connection with these amendments 
unsecured secured notes exchange in may  we completed a series of private offers in which we issued million aggregate principal amount of our second priority senior secured guaranteed notes due notes and million aggregate principal amounts of our second priority senior secured guaranteed notes due notes and together with the notes  the second priority secured exchange notes in exchange for billion aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured notes of various series 
the second priority secured exchange notes are collateralized by a second priority lien on the same pool of collateral pledged under the first and second priority credit agreements 
in conjunction with the exchange  we also purchased million par value of our outstanding senior floating rate notes due september in a cash tender offer 
as a result of the secured note exchange  we recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of million at the time of the transaction as well as a deferred gain of million  reflected as a premium on the new secured notes which will be amortized to interest expense over the terms of the secured notes 
note repurchases during the year ended december   we repurchased  through open market and private transactions  billion par value of our senior unsecured notes with various maturities ranging from january to march in connection with these repurchases  we recorded an aggregate net gain on early extinguishment of debt of million for the year ended december  debt covenants our ability to borrow under our secured credit facilities depends on maintaining compliance with various covenants  including a minimum tangible net worth covenant and specified financial ratios  such as fixed charge coverage  unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness  eligible collateral coverage and leverage 
our recent financial results have put pressure on our ability to maintain compliance with certain of the debt covenants in our secured bank credit facilities 
in particular  our tangible net worth at december  was approximately billion  which is not significantly above the financial covenant minimum requirement in our secured credit facilities of billion 
we intend to operate our business in order to remain in compliance with the covenants in our debt instruments  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
further loan loss reserves and impairment charges will adversely impact our tangible net worth 
all of these covenants on our facilities are maintenance covenants and  if breached could result in an acceleration of our facilities if a waiver or modification is not agreed upon with the requisite percentage of the unsecured lending group and lenders on our other facilities 
our secured credit facilities also impose limitations on repayments  repurchases  refinancings and optional redemptions of our existing unsecured notes or secured exchange notes issued pursuant to our exchange offer  as well as limitations on repurchases of our common stock 
for so long as 
table of contents we maintain our qualification as a reit  the secured credit facilities permit us to distribute of our reit taxable income on an annual basis 
we may not pay common dividends if we cease to qualify as a reit 
our publicly held debt securities also contain covenants that include fixed charge coverage and unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness ratios and our secured debt securities have an eligible collateral coverage requirement 
the fixed charge coverage ratio in our publicly held securities is an incurrence test 
if we do not meet the fixed charge coverage ratio  our ability to incur additional indebtedness will be restricted 
the unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness covenant and the eligible collateral coverage covenant are maintenance covenants and  if breached and not cured within applicable cure periods  could result in acceleration of our publicly held debt unless a waiver or modification is agreed upon with the requisite percentage of the bondholders 
based on our unsecured credit ratings at december   the financial covenants in our publicly held debt securities  including the fixed charge coverage ratio and maintenance of unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness ratio  are operative 
our secured credit facilities and our public debt securities contain cross default provisions that would allow the lenders and the bondholders to declare an event of default and accelerate our indebtedness to them if we fail to pay amounts due in respect of our other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds 
in addition  our secured credit facilities  unsecured credit facilities and the indentures governing our public debt securities provide that the lenders and bondholders may declare an event of default and accelerate our indebtedness to them if there is a non payment default under our other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds and  if the holders of the other indebtedness are permitted to accelerate  in the case of the secured credit facilities  or accelerate  in the case of our unsecured credit facilities and the bond indentures  the other recourse indebtedness 
the first and second priority credit agreements and the indentures governing the second priority secured exchange notes contain a number of covenants  including that we maintain collateral coverage of at least x the aggregate borrowings and letters of credit outstanding under the first priority credit agreement  the second priority credit agreements and the second priority secured exchange notes 
under certain circumstances  the first and second priority credit agreements require that payments of principal and net sale proceeds received by us in respect of assets constituting collateral for our obligations under these agreements be applied toward the mandatory prepayment of loans and commitment reductions under them 
we would be required to make such prepayments i during any time that the ratio of our ebitda to fixed charges  as defined under the agreements  is less than to  ii if  after receiving a payment of principal or net sale proceeds in respect of collateral  the company has insufficient eligible assets available to pledge as replacement collateral or iii if  and for so long as  the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under the first priority credit agreement exceeds million at any time on or after september   or zero at any time on or after march  we believe we are in full compliance with all the covenants in our debt instruments as of december  ratings triggers our first and second priority secured credit agreements and unsecured credit agreements bear interest at libor based rates plus an applicable margin which varies between the credit agreements and is determined based on our corporate credit ratings 
our ability to borrow under our credit facilities is not dependent on the level of our credit ratings 
based on our current credit ratings  further downgrades in our credit ratings will have no effect on our borrowing rates under these facilities 
off balance sheet transactions we are not dependent on the use of any off balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity 
unfunded commitments we generally fund construction and development loans and build outs of ctl space over a period of time if and when the borrowers and tenants meet established milestones and

we refer to these arrangements as performance based commitments 
in addition  we sometimes establish a maximum amount of additional funding which we will make available to a borrower or tenant for an expansion or addition to a project if we approve of the expansion or addition in our sole discretion 
we refer to these arrangements as discretionary fundings 
finally  we have committed to invest capital in several real estate funds and other ventures 
these arrangements are referred to as strategic investments

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported as assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods  including any judgments made as part of such methods  are well controlled  reviewed and applied consistently from period to period 
we base our estimates on historical corporate and industry experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances 
for all of these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and  therefore  routinely require adjustment 
during  management reviewed and evaluated these critical accounting estimates and believes they are appropriate 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated 
table of contents financial statements 
the following is a summary of accounting policies that require more significant management estimates and judgments reserve for loan losses the reserve for loan losses is a valuation allowance that reflects management s estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the reserve is increased through the provision for loan losses on our consolidated statements of operations and is decreased by charge offs when losses are confirmed through the receipt of assets such as cash in a pre foreclosure sale or via ownership control of the underlying collateral in full satisfaction of the loan upon foreclosure or when significant collection efforts have ceased 
the reserve for loan losses includes a general  formula based component and an asset specific component 
the general  formula based reserve component covers performing loans and provisions for loan losses are recorded when i available information as of each balance sheet date indicates that it is probable a loss has occurred in the portfolio and ii the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
required reserve balances for the performing loan portfolio are derived from estimated probabilities of principal loss and loss given default severities 
estimated probabilities of principal loss and loss severities are assigned to each loan in the portfolio during our quarterly internal risk rating assessment 
probabilities of principal loss and severity factors are based on industry and or internal experience and may be adjusted for significant factors that  based on our judgment  impact the collectability of the loans as of the balance sheet date 
the asset specific reserve component relates to reserves for losses on impaired loans 
we consider a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  we believe that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
a reserve is established when the present value of payments expected to be received  observable market prices  or the estimated fair value of the collateral for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment of an impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
a loan is also considered impaired if its terms are modified in a troubled debt restructuring tdr 
a tdr occurs when the company grants a concession to a borrower in financial difficulty by modifying the original terms of the loan 
each of our non performing loans npl s and tdr loans are considered impaired and are evaluated individually to determine required asset specific reserves 
the provision for loan losses for the years ended december   and were billion  billion and million  respectively 
the increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to increased asset specific reserves required as a result of the increase in impaired loans 
the total reserve for loan losses at december  and  included asset specific reserves of billion and million  respectively  and general reserves of million and million  respectively 
impairment of available for sale and held to maturity debt securities for held to maturity and available for sale debt securities held in loans and other lending investments  management evaluates whether the asset is other than temporarily impaired when the fair market value is below carrying value 
we consider debt securities other than temporarily impaired if we have the intent to sell the security  it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery  or we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
if it is determined that an other than temporary impairment exists  the portion related to credit losses  where we do not expect to recover our entire amortized cost basis  will be recognized as an impairment of other assets on the our consolidated statements of operations 
if we do not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security  but the security has suffered a credit loss  the impairment charge will be separated 
the credit loss component of the impairment will be recorded as an impairment of other assets on our consolidated statements of operations  and the remainder will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
during the years ended december   and  we determined that unrealized credit related losses on certain held to maturity and available for sale debt securities were other than temporary 
table of contents and recorded impairment charges totaling million  million and million  respectively  in impairment of other assets on the consolidated statements of operations 
there are no other than temporary impairments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  other real estate owned oreo consists of properties acquired through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure in full or partial satisfaction of non performing loans that we intend to market for sale in the near term 
oreo is recorded at the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the excess of the carrying value of the loan over the fair value of the property less estimated costs to sell is charged off against the reserve for loan losses when title to the property is obtained 
significant property improvements may be capitalized to the extent that the carrying value of the property does not exceed the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the gain or loss on final disposition of an oreo is recorded in impairment of other assets on our consolidated statements of operations  and is considered income loss from continuing operations as it represents the final stage of our loan collection process 
we review the recoverability of an oreo asset s carrying value when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment of a property s value 
if impairment exists a loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property less cost to sell 
these impairments are recorded in impairment of other assets on the consolidated statements of operations 
during the years ended december   and  we received titles to properties in satisfaction of senior mortgage loans with cumulative carrying values of billion  million and million  respectively  for which those properties had served as collateral  and recorded charge offs totaling million  million and million  respectively  related to these loans 
subsequent to taking title to the properties  we determined certain oreo assets were impaired due to changing market conditions  and recorded impairment charges of million and million during the year ended december  and real estate held for investment  net rehi consists of properties acquired through foreclosure or through deed in lieu of foreclosure in full or partial satisfaction of non performing loans that management intends to hold  operate or develop for a period of at least twelve months 
rehi assets are initially recorded at their estimated fair value 
the excess of the carrying value of the loan over the fair value of the property is charged off against the reserve for loan losses when title to the property is obtained 
upon acquisition  tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their estimated fair values 
we consider rehi assets to be long lived and periodically review them for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment of rehi assets is measured in the same manner as long lived assets as described below 
long lived assets impairment test ctl assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell and are included in assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets 
the difference between the estimated fair value less costs to sell and the carrying value will be recorded as an impairment charge and included in income from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations 
once the asset is classified as held for sale  depreciation expense is no longer recorded and historical operating results are reclassified to income from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations 
we periodically review long lived assets to be held and used for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
a held for use long lived asset s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the asset taking into account the anticipated holding period of the asset is less than the carrying value 
such estimate of cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of 
table of contents demand  competition and other economic factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the asset and reflected as an adjustment to the basis of the asset 
impairments of ctl and rehi assets are recorded in impairment of other assets  on our consolidated statements of operations 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  due to changes in market conditions 
identified intangible assets and goodwill we record intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair values separate and apart from goodwill 
we determine whether such intangible assets have finite or indefinite lives 
as of december   all such acquired intangible assets have finite lives 
we amortize finite lived intangible assets based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired 
we review finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if we determine the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable we will record an impairment charge to the extent its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
impairments of intangibles are recorded in impairment of other assets on our consolidated statements of operations 
the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired including identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test is done at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
due to an overall deterioration in conditions within the commercial real estate market  we recorded impairment charges of million during and million during to write off the goodwill allocated to the ctl and real estate lending reporting segments  respectively 
these charges were recorded in impairment of goodwill on our consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended december   we also recorded non cash charges of million to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets related to the fremont cre acquisition and other acquisitions  based on their revised estimated fair values 
these charges were recorded in impairment of other assets on our consolidated statements of operations 
consolidation variable interest entities we invest in many entities in which we either own a minority interest or may have a majority interest  but do not have voting control of the entity 
we must evaluate these types of interests to determine if the entity is a variable interest entity vie  and if we are the primary beneficiary 
there is a significant amount of judgment required to determine if an entity is considered a vie and if we are the primary beneficiary  we first perform a qualitative analysis  which requires certain subjective decisions regarding our assessment  including  but not limited to  the nature and structure of the entity  the variability of the economic interests that the entity passes along to its interest holders  the rights of the parties and the purpose of the arrangement 
an iterative quantitative analysis is required if our qualitative analysis proves inconclusive as to whether the entity is a vie or we are the primary beneficiary and consolidation is required 
fair value of assets and liabilities the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters 
for financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters  there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value 
when observable market prices and parameters are not fully available  management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
in addition  changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data 
for example  reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in 
table of contents secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable 
therefore  when market data is not available  we would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion on our use of fair valuation of financial and non financial assets and financial liabilities and the related measurement techniques

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
in pursuing our business plan  the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
consistent with our liability management objectives  we have implemented an interest rate risk management policy based on match funding  with the objective that variable rate assets be primarily financed by variable rate liabilities and fixed rate assets be primarily financed by fixed rate liabilities 
we also seek to match fund our foreign denominated assets with foreign denominated debt so that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will have a minimal impact on earnings 
our operating results will depend in part on the difference between the interest and related income earned on our assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities 
competition from other providers of real estate financing may lead to a decrease in the interest rate earned on our interest bearing assets  which we may not be able to offset by obtaining lower interest costs on our borrowings 
changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
any significant compression of the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could  among other things  reduce the value of our interest bearing assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets  and a decrease in interest rates could reduce the average life of our interest earning assets if borrowers refinance our loans 
approximately of our loan investments are subject to prepayment protection in the form of lock outs  yield maintenance provisions or other prepayment premiums which provide substantial yield protection to us 
those assets generally not subject to prepayment penalties include variable rate loans based on libor  originated or acquired at par  which would not result in any gain or loss upon repayment  and discount loans and loan participations acquired at discounts to face values  which would result in gains upon repayment 
further  while we generally seek to enter into loan investments which provide for substantial prepayment protection  in the event of declining interest rates  we could receive such prepayments and may not be able to reinvest such proceeds at favorable returns 
such prepayments could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risks in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment or further economic downturn  defaults could increase and cause additional credit losses to us which adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
further  such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond our control 
as fully discussed in note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements  we seek to employ match funding based financing and hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations  including engaging in interest rate caps  swaps and other interest rate related derivative contracts 
these strategies are specifically designed to reduce our exposure  on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis  to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate movements in the market 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes or as a hedge against changes in our credit risk or the credit risk of our borrowers 

table of contents while a reit may utilize derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk on its liabilities incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets without generating non qualifying income  use of derivatives for other purposes will generate non qualified income for reit income test purposes 
this includes hedging asset related risks such as credit  foreign exchange and prepayment or interest rate exposure on our loan assets 
as a result our ability to hedge these types of risks is limited 
there can be no assurance that our profitability will not be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
in addition  hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  legal enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
with regard to loss of basis in a hedging contract  indices upon which contracts are based may be more or less variable than the indices upon which the hedged assets or liabilities are based  thereby making the hedge less effective 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
we are potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by these counterparties 
however  because of their high credit ratings  we do not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and that we will ultimately realize an economic benefit from any hedging contract we enter into which exceeds the related costs incurred in connection with engaging in such hedges 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net investment income should interest rates increase by or basis points and decrease by basis points  assuming no change in the shape of the yield curve ie  relative interest rates 
net investment income is calculated as revenue from loans and other lending investments and operating leases and earnings from equity method investments  less interest expense  operating costs on ctl assets and gain on early extinguishment of debt  for the year ended december  the base interest rate scenario assumes the one month libor rate of as of december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table

in addition  interest rate floors on certain of our loan assets further increase net investment income as rates decrease and vice versa
