item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the business the company franchises and operates mcdonald s restaurants 
of the  restaurants in countries at year end   were operated by franchisees including  operated by conventional franchisees   operated by developmental licensees and  operated by foreign affiliated markets affiliates primarily in japan and  were operated by the company 
under our conventional franchise arrangement  franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment  signs  seating and d cor of their restaurant businesses  and by reinvesting in the business over time 
the company owns the land and building or secures long term leases for both company operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites 
this maintains long term occupancy rights  helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees 
in certain circumstances  the company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants 
under our developmental license arrangement  licensees provide capital for the entire business  including the real estate interest  and the company has no capital invested 
in addition  the company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market 
we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great  locally relevant customer experiences and driving profitability 
however  directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing company personnel with restaurant operations experience 
in our company operated restaurants  and in collaboration with franchisees  we further develop and refine operating standards  marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies  so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced systemwide 
we continually review our mix of company operated and franchised conventional franchised  developmental licensed and affiliated restaurants to help maximize overall performance 
the company s revenues consist of sales by company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees 
revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments  and initial fees 
revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales  and may include initial fees 
fees vary by type of site  amount of company investment  if any  and local business conditions 
these fees  along with occupancy and operating rights  are stipulated in franchise license agreements that generally have year terms 
the business is managed as distinct geographic segments 
significant reportable segments include the united states us  europe  and asia pacific  middle east and africa apmea 
in addition  throughout this report we present other countries corporate that includes operations in canada and latin america  as well as corporate activities 
the us  europe and apmea segments account for  and of total revenues  respectively 
france  germany and the united kingdom uk  collectively  account for approximately of europe s revenues  and australia  china and japan a owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method  collectively  account for over of apmea s revenues 
these six markets along with the us and canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise over of total revenues 
the company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the mcdonald s restaurant business as we believe opportunities remain for long term growth 
accordingly  in  the company sold its minority ownership interest in redbox automated retail  llc redbox for total consideration of million 
in  the company sold its minority ownership interest in uk based pret a manger for cash proceeds of million 
in connection with both sales  the company recognized nonoperating gains 
during  the company sold its investment in boston market 
as a result of the disposal  boston market s results of operations and transaction gain are reflected as discontinued operations 
as of december   the company had disposed of all non mcdonald s restaurant businesses 
in analyzing business trends  management considers a variety of performance and financial measures  including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth  systemwide sales growth  restaurant margins and returns 
constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates 
management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the company s underlying business trends 
comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the company s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends 
increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions  respectively  from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants in operation at least thirteen months  including those temporarily closed 
some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling  rebuilding  road construction and natural disasters 
comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation 
mcdonald s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month  quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days 
the number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts 
the company refers to these impacts as calendar shift trading day adjustments 
in addition  the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts 
these impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal 
in  there was an incremental full day of sales and guest counts due to leap year 
systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants  whether operated by the company or by franchisees 
while franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company  management believes the information is important in understanding the company s financial performance because these sales are the 
table of contents basis on which the company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base 
return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units  the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital 
the return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization numerator by the adjusted cash used for investing activities denominator  primarily capital expenditures 
the calculation assumes a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation 
strategic direction and financial performance the strength of the alignment between the company  its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system has been key to mcdonald s success over the years 
this business model enables mcdonald s to consistently deliver locally relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve 
in addition  it facilitates our ability to identify  implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers changing needs and preferences 
mcdonald s customer focused plan to win which is centered around being better  not just bigger provides a common framework for our global business yet allows for local adaptation 
through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five key drivers of exceptional customer experiences people  products  place  price and promotion we have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown sales and customer visits in each of the last six years 
this plan  coupled with financial discipline  has delivered strong results for shareholders 
we have exceeded our long term  constant currency financial targets of average annual systemwide sales growth of to  average annual operating income growth of to  and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the plan s implementation in  after adjusting for the latin america developmental license transaction 
given the size and scope of our global business  we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable  while keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the long term benefit of shareholders 
in  we continued to elevate the customer experience by remaining focused on the company s key global success factors of branded affordability  menu variety and beverage choice  convenience and daypart expansion  ongoing restaurant reinvestment and operations excellence 
locally relevant initiatives around these factors successfully resonated with consumers driving increases in sales  customer visits and market share in many countries despite challenging global economies and a contracting informal eating out market 
as a result  each reportable segment contributed to global comparable sales and guest counts  which increased and  respectively 
in the us  we grew sales and market share with comparable sales up for the th consecutive year  rising in this performance was the result of a continued focus on classic menu favorites such as the big mac and quarter pounder  increased emphasis on everyday affordability  and the national marketing launch of the new mccaf premium coffees and premium angus third pounder 
complementing these efforts were our strategies related to convenient locations  extended hours  efficient drive thru service and value oriented local beverage promotions 
in conjunction with the introduction of the mccaf premium coffees  reinvestment was needed in many restaurants to accommodate the new equipment required to prepare these beverages as well as facilitate the national introduction of smoothies and frapp s in mid in most cases  this reinvestment involved expanding and optimizing the efficiency of the drive thru booth  enabling us to better serve even more customers faster 
in europe  comparable sales rose  marking the th consecutive year of comparable sales increases 
this performance reflected europe s strategic priorities to upgrade the customer and employee experience  enhance local relevance  and build brand transparency 
initiatives surrounding these priorities encompassed leveraging our tiered menu featuring locally relevant selections of premium  classic core and everyday affordable menu offerings as well as dessert and limited time food promotions  and reimaging nearly restaurants including adding about mccaf s an upscale area with coffeehouse style ambiance inside an existing mcdonald s restaurant 
in addition  we addressed growing interest in portable snack offerings with platforms such as the little tasters in the uk  launched breakfast in germany and increased our convenience with extended hours 
in order to support greater menu variety  we completed the roll out of a new more efficient kitchen operating system in substantially all of our european restaurants 
finally  we enhanced customer trust in our brand through communications that emphasized the quality and origin of mcdonald s food and our sustainable business practices 
in apmea  we continued to execute our four growth platforms of breakfast  convenience  core menu and value 
comparable sales rose primarily due to the ongoing momentum of our business in australia where multiple initiatives surrounding menu variety including the launch of the premium angus burger  greater convenience and reimaging further strengthened our brand relevance 
in addition  across the segment  we enhanced our convenience by increasing the number of restaurants open hours to over  expanding delivery service to more than  locations including about in china  and enhancing drive thru efficiency 
we sustained the momentum of our breakfast business  currently in about of our restaurants  by increasing customer awareness and visit frequency with the launch of premium roast coffee in key markets like japan and china and promoting it through successful sampling programs 
we continued to appeal to customers with branded affordability menus  especially our value lunch platforms  and highlighted classic menu favorites like the quarter pounder 
our customer centered strategies seek to optimize price  product mix and promotion as a means to drive sales and profits 
this approach is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and effectively managing restaurant level costs by leveraging our scale  supply chain infrastructure and risk management practices 
our ability to successfully execute our strategies in every area of the world contributed to improved profitability as measured by combined operating margin of in  an improvement of percentage points over strong global performance positively impacted cash from operations  which totaled billion in our substantial cash flow  strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us significant flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders 
about billion of cash 
table of contents from operations was invested in our business primarily to open restaurants net  after closings and reimage about  existing locations 
after these capital expenditures  we returned our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
in  we returned billion consisting of billion in dividends and billion in share repurchases 
this brought the total return to shareholders to billion under our billion to billion target for through cash from operations continues to benefit from our evolution toward a more heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owner operators is a very stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs  and is less capital intensive 
in addition  we believe locally owned and operated restaurants help us maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantage  making mcdonald s not just a global brand but also a locally relevant one 
to that end  for and combined  we refranchised about  restaurants  increasing the percent of restaurants franchised worldwide to 
refranchising impacts our consolidated financial statements as follows consolidated revenues are initially reduced because we collect rent and royalty as a percent of sales from a refranchised restaurant instead of of its sales 
company operated margin dollars decline while franchised margin dollars increase 
margin percentages are affected depending on the sales and cost structures of the restaurants refranchised 
other operating income expense fluctuates as we recognize gains and or losses resulting from sales of restaurants 
combined operating margin percent improves 
return on average assets increases primarily due to a decrease in average asset balances 
highlights from the year included comparable sales grew and guest counts rose  building on increases of and  respectively 
growth in combined operating margin of percentage points from in to in operating income increased in constant currencies 
net income per share was  an increase of in constant currencies 
cash provided by operations totaled billion 
the company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share to for the fourth quarter bringing the current annual dividend rate to per share 
one year roiic was and three year roiic was for the period ended december  outlook for we will continue to drive success in and beyond by remaining focused on our better  not just bigger strategy and the key drivers of exceptional customer experiences people  products  place  price and promotion 
our global system is energized by our ongoing momentum  strong competitive position and growth opportunities 
we intend to further differentiate our brand  increase customer visits and grow market share by pursuing initiatives in three key areas service enhancement  restaurant reimaging and menu innovation 
these efforts will include leveraging technology to make it easier for restaurant staff to quickly and accurately serve customers  accelerating our interior and exterior reimaging efforts and innovating at every tier of our menu to deliver great taste and value to customers 
as we execute along these priorities and remain disciplined in operations and financial management  we expect to increase mcdonald s brand relevance  widen our competitive lead and  in turn  grow sales  profits and returns 
as we do so  we are confident we can meet or exceed the long term constant currency financial targets previously discussed despite expectations for a continued challenging global economic environment in in the us  our strategies include strengthening our core menu and value offerings  aggressively pursuing new growth opportunities in chicken  breakfast  beverages and snacking options  and elevating the brand experience 
our initiatives include highlighting the enduring appeal of core menu classics such as the big mac  emphasizing the value our menu offers all day long including the new breakfast value menu  and encouraging the trial of new products with the mac snack wrap and by mid year frapp s and smoothies 
in addition  our plans to elevate the brand experience encompass updating our technology with a new point of sale system  enhancing restaurant manager and crew retention and productivity  and initiating a multi year program to contemporize the interiors and exteriors of our restaurants through reimaging  completing about in these efforts combined with the convenience of our locations  optimized drive thru service  free wireless service and longer operating hours will further reinforce mcdonald s position as an easy  enjoyable eating out experience 
our plans for europe are focused on building market share as we continue to execute along europe s three key priorities 
this includes upgrading our restaurant ambiance by reimaging approximately  restaurants  primarily in france and the uk  as we make progress toward our goal to reimage more than of our restaurants by the end of in addition  we expect to leverage technologies such as self order kiosks  hand held order devices and drive thru customer order displays to enhance the customer experience and help speed service 
we will further enhance our local relevance by complementing our tiered menu with limited time food events as well as new snack and dessert options 
finally  we will remain approachable and accessible as we continue to educate consumers about the quality and origin of our food and communicate our sustainable business practices 
in apmea  we will execute initiatives that best support our goal to be customers first choice for eating out convenience  core menu  branded affordability  improved operations and reimaging 
our convenience initiatives include leveraging the success of hour or extended operating hours  expanding delivery service and building drive thru traffic 
at the same time  we will continue to elevate the role of our classic core and breakfast menus  complementing both with locally relevant food news 
we will maximize the impact of our everyday affordability platforms with mid tier and value lunch programs and intensify our focus on operations to drive efficiencies 
in addition  we will accelerate our reimaging efforts using a set of standard interior and exterior designs 
finally  given its size and long term 
table of contents potential  we will continue to aggressively open new restaurants in china with a goal of opening about restaurants over the next three years 
we will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our mix of company operated and franchised restaurants and expect to refranchise restaurants when and where appropriate 
as previously discussed  our evolution toward a more heavily franchised  less capital intensive business model has favorable implications for the strength and stability of our cash flow  the amount of capital we invest and long term returns 
as a result  we expect free cash flow cash from operations less capital expenditures will continue to grow in the future 
we remain committed to returning all this cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases over the long term 
we will remain disciplined financially as we seek to maximize the impact of all of our spending from selling  general administrative expenses to capital expenditures 
in making capital allocation decisions  our goal is to elevate the mcdonald s experience to drive sustainable growth in sales and market share while earning strong returns 
to that end  about half of the billion of planned capital expenditures will be invested to reimage existing restaurants with the other half primarily used to build new locations 
mcdonald s does not provide specific guidance on net income per share 
the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the company s results changes in systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion 
the company expects net restaurant additions to add nearly percentage points to systemwide sales growth in constant currencies  most of which will be due to the net traditional restaurants added in the company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales 
however  as a perspective  assuming no change in cost structure  a percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the us or europe would increase annual net income per share by about cents 
with about of mcdonald s grocery bill comprised of different commodities  a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the company s commodity costs 
for the full year  the total basket of goods cost is expected to be relatively flat in the us and europe 
some volatility may be experienced between quarters in the normal course of business  with more favorable comparisons in the first half of the year 
the company expects full year selling  general administrative expenses to be relatively flat  in constant currencies  although fluctuations will be experienced between quarters due to certain items in such as the vancouver winter olympics and the biennial worldwide owner operator convention in april 
based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates  the company expects interest expense in to increase slightly compared with a significant part of the company s operating income is generated outside the us  and about of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the euro  british pound  australian dollar and canadian dollar 
collectively  these currencies represent approximately of the company s operating income outside the us if all four of these currencies moved by in the same direction compared with  the company s annual net income per share would change by about to cents 
at current foreign currency rates  the company expects foreign currency translation to positively impact full year revenues and net income per share  with most of the benefit occurring in the first half of the year 
the company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year to be approximately to 
some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range 
mcdonald s japan a owned affiliate announced plans to close approximately restaurants over the next months in conjunction with the strategic review of the market s real estate portfolio 
these actions are designed to enhance the customer experience  overall profitability and returns of the market 
as a result of these closures  mcdonald s corporation expects to record after tax impairment charges totaling approximately million to million  primarily in the first half of the year 
the company expects capital expenditures for to be approximately billion 
about half of this amount will be reinvested in existing restaurants  including the reimaging of over  locations worldwide 
the rest will primarily be used to open about  restaurants traditional and satellites 
these restaurant numbers include new unit openings about restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensed markets  such as japan and latin america  where the company does not fund any capital expenditures 
the company expects net additions of about restaurants net traditional additions and net satellite closings  which reflect the mcdonald s japan closings

in august  the company completed the sale of its businesses in brazil  argentina  mexico  puerto rico  venezuela and other countries in latin america and the caribbean  which totaled  restaurants  to a developmental licensee organization 
the company refers to these markets as latam 
as a result of the latam transaction  the company receives royalties in these markets instead of a combination of company operated sales and franchised rents and royalties 
based on approval by the company s board of directors on april   the company concluded latam was held for sale as of that date in accordance with guidance on the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of billion in  substantially all of which was noncash 
the charge included million for the difference between the net book value of the latam business and approximately million in cash proceeds received 
this loss in value was primarily due to a historically difficult economic environment coupled with volatility experienced in many of the markets included in this transaction 
the charges also included historical foreign currency translation losses of million recorded in shareholders equity 
the company recorded a tax benefit of million in in connection with this transaction

the company mitigates the currency impact to income of these foreign currency denominated liabilities through the use of forward foreign exchange agreements 
the buyers of the company s operations in latam entered into a year master franchise agreement that requires the buyers  among other obligations to i pay monthly royalties commencing at a rate of approximately of gross sales of the restaurants in these markets  substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements  ii commit to adding approximately new mcdonald s restaurants by the end of and pay an initial fee for each new restaurant opened  and iii commit to specified annual capital expenditures for existing restaurants

in most cases  franchising is the best way to achieve these goals  but as previously stated  company operated restaurants are also important to our success 
we report results for company operated restaurants based on their sales  less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs 
we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues  less associated occupancy costs 
for this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure  we do not specifically allocate selling  general administrative expenses and other operating income expenses to company operated or franchised restaurants 
other operating items that relate to the company operated restaurants generally include gains losses on sales of restaurant businesses and write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements 
we believe the following information about company operated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business 
management responsible for our company operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the company operated business on this basis to assess its performance 
management of the company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix  subject to other relevant considerations 
the following tables seek to illustrate the two components of our company operated margins 
the first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations  which we refer to as store operating margin 
the second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties 
we refer to this component as brand real estate margin 
both company operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties  although rent and royalties for company operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation 
rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales  and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of mcdonald s investment in the restaurant 
royalty rates may also vary by market 
as shown in the following tables  in disaggregating the components of our company operated margins  certain costs with respect to company operated restaurants are reflected in brand real estate margin 
those costs consist of rent payable by mcdonald s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy other operating expenses recorded in the consolidated statement of income

the company s key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table 
while the company targets these metrics for ease of focus  it also considers similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt 
total adjusted debt  a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above  includes debt outstanding on the company s balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases 
based on their most recent calculations  these agencies add between billion and billion to debt for lease capitalization purposes  which increases total debt as a percent of total capitalization and reduces cash provided by operations as a percent of total debt for credit rating purposes 
the company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments 
these adjustments include excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents  excluding certain company operated restaurant lease agreements outside the us that are cancelable with minimal penalties representing approximately of company operated restaurant minimum rents outside the us  based on the company s estimate  capitalizing non restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense  and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent 
table of contents payments due to the company from franchisees operating on leased sites 
based on this calculation  for credit analysis purposes  approximately billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized 
certain of the company s debt obligations contain cross acceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the long term debt of certain subsidiaries 
there are no provisions in the company s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company s business 
under existing authorization from the company s board of directors  at december   the company has billion of authority remaining to borrow funds  including through i public or private offering of debt securities  ii direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions  and iii other forms of indebtedness

debt maturing in is approximately million of long term corporate debt 
in  the company expects to issue commercial paper and long term debt to refinance this maturing debt 
the company also has million of foreign currency bank line borrowings outstanding at year end 
historically  the company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt 
although there are continued constraints in the overall financial markets on available credit  the company s ability to raise funding in the long term and short term debt capital markets has not been adversely affected

the company uses major capital markets  bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense 
the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring  redeeming and repurchasing debt  terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives 
the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes 
all exchange agreements are over the counter instruments 
in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations  the company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated 
the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties  intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates 
this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity 
total foreign currency denominated debt was billion for the years ended december  and in addition  where practical  the company s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges 
see summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives 
the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements 
certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below  or aggregate exposures exceed  certain contractual limits 
at december   neither the company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position  other than on hedges of certain of the company s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position 
the company s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies 
the company s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities at year end were as follows foreign currency net asset exposures in millions of us dollars euro australian dollars canadian dollars british pounds sterling russian ruble the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company s results of operations  cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments 
the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments  however  the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues  local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company s financial instruments  neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from levels nor a adverse change in foreign currency rates from levels would materially affect the company s results of operations  cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 
contractual obligations and commitments the company has long term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations related to both company operated and franchised restaurants and debt obligations 
in addition  the company has long term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements 
cash provided by operations including cash provided by these franchise arrangements along with the company s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of 
table of contents december  see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details

the company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to i make tax deferred contributions and ii receive company provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of irs limitations 
the investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market rate investment alternatives under the company s qualified profit sharing and savings plan 
total liabilities for the supplemental plans were million at december  and are reflected on mcdonald s consolidated balance sheet as follows other long term liabilities million  and accrued payroll and other liabilities million 
total liabilities for international retirement plans at december  were million and were primarily reflected in other long term liabilities 
the company has also recorded million of gross unrecognized tax benefits at december   of which million is included in other long term liabilities and million is included in deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet 
other matters critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 
the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity property and equipment property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property 
the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets  taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors  economic factors and industry trends 
if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment  or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future periods 
share based compensation the company has a share based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors 
the expense for these equity based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period 
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form pricing model 
the pricing model requires assumptions  such as the expected life of the stock option  the risk free interest rate and expected volatility of the company s stock over the expected life  which significantly impact the assumed fair value 
the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants  share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 
the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 
long lived assets impairment review long lived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company s experience and knowledge of its operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation  competition  and consumer and demographic trends 
a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales 
if the company s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges 
based on the annual goodwill impairment test  conducted in the fourth quarter  the company does not have any reporting units defined as each individual country with goodwill currently at risk of impairment 
when the company sells an existing business to a developmental licensee  it determines when these businesses are held for sale in accordance with guidance on the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
impairment charges on assets held for sale are recognized when management and  if required  the company s board of directors have approved and committed to a 
table of contents plan to dispose of the assets  the assets are available for disposal  the disposal is probable of occurring within months  and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than the assets net book value  among other factors 
an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the net book value of the business including foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and the estimated cash sales price  less costs of disposal 
an alternative accounting policy would be to recharacterize some or all of any loss as an intangible asset and amortize it to expense over future periods based on the term of the relevant licensing arrangement and as revenue is recognized for royalties and initial fees 
under this alternative for the latam transaction  approximately million of the billion impairment charge could have been recharacterized as an intangible asset and amortized over the franchise term of years  resulting in about million of expense annually 
this policy would be based on a view that the consideration for the sale consists of two components the cash sales price and the future royalties and initial fees 
the company bases its accounting policy on management s determination that royalties payable under its developmental license arrangements are substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements 
the company does not believe it would be appropriate to recognize an asset for the right to receive market based fees in future periods  particularly given the continuing support and services provided to the licensees 
therefore  the company believes that the recognition of an impairment charge based on the net cash sales price reflects the substance of the sale transaction 
litigation accruals from time to time  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to competitors  customers  employees  franchisees  government agencies  intellectual property  shareholders and suppliers 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accrual required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies  including the sale of appreciated assets  in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits  and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
during  the irs examination of the company s us tax returns was completed 
the tax provision impact associated with the completion of this examination was not significant 
during  the company recorded a million benefit as a result of the completion of an irs examination of the company s us tax returns 
the company s us tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the examination is expected in deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates 
the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the us if management s intentions change in the future  deferred taxes may need to be provided 
effects of changing prices inflation the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively 
this is because of rapid inventory turnover  the ability to adjust menu prices  cost controls and substantial property holdings  many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation 
reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units  the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital 
this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation 
the numerator is the company s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period 
the denominator is the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or three year period 
adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the boston market  chipotle  latam  pret a manger and redbox transactions 
the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis 
these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter s investing activities to incremental operating income 
for example  fourth quarter investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income of fourth quarter investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations 
in contrast  fourth quarter is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than months ago  and therefore have a full year impact on operating income  with little or no impact to the base period and of fourth quarter investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations  respectively 
management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average
