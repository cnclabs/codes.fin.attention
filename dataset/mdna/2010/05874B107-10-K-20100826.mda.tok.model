we review certain financial measures in assessing our financial condition and operating performance not only in connection with creating our forecasts and in making comparisons to financial results from prior periods  but also in making comparisons to our competitors financial results and our internal plans 
we focus on fluctuations in revenue  cost and gross margin and also pay close attention to changes in our consolidated operating income  net income  diluted earnings per share  adjusted ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  including asset charges and share based compensation  cash flows from operations and free cash flow cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures as they are key indicators of our success 
we also measure changes in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percent of revenue  which indicate management s ability to control costs  as well as changes in r d as a percent of revenue  which demonstrate investment in technology and product development 
the measures listed above are not a comprehensive list of all factors considered by us in assessing our financial condition and operating performance  and we may consider other individual measures as required by trends and discrete events arising in a specific period  but they are the key indicators 
we are currently operating in a challenging economic environment 
the combination of economic uncertainty  lower demand for replacement products and reduced opportunities from new or expanded markets has negatively impacted our consolidated results 
the gaming sector was and continues to be negatively impacted by lower consumer spending and limited resources available to fund capital projects 
as a result of the challenging economic environment  we have provided a greater amount of payment terms for periods up to one year  and in some cases for terms up to three years  to select customers

during fiscal  we released version systems products  added new international contracts  and in october  a large resort and casino in southern california signed an agreement with us to allow them to purchase up to  iview dm controllers

domestically  we are focused on new jurisdictional opportunities in ohio  illinois  kansas  iowa  maryland  florida  new york and california  and the potential for new markets including massachusetts  kentucky  maine  texas and north carolina 
the breadth and timing of such opportunities remains uncertain due to the legislative process in these jurisdictions  as well as the difficult credit environment facing certain of our customers and the risk of the gaming industry impact of continued economic uncertainty 
we are also engaged in expanding our position in mexico as it moves to class iii gaming and  in the future  the new italian vlt market  australia and potentially brazil and greece

revenue is recognized when all of the following have been satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price or fee is fixed or determinable  collectability is probable  and no significant contractual obligations remain 
we offer credit terms of to days 
we also grant extended credit terms under contracts of sale secured by the related equipment  for periods up to one year  and in some cases for terms up to three years  with interest recognized at market rates 
games placed with customers on a trial basis are not recognized as revenue until the trial period ends  or the customer accepts the games and collectability is probable 
amounts billed prior to completing the earnings process are deferred until revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenues are reported net of incentive rebates  discounts  sales taxes  and other taxes of a similar nature 
gaming revenues from our discontinued casino operations were recognized as the net win from gaming machine and table game operations  which is the difference between currency deposited into the devices or placed at the table games and the payouts made to the players  less any coupons or other promotional allowances  if applicable 
gaming operations revenue consists of the operation of linked progressive systems and from gaming devices  software content and the related systems placed in casinos on a daily fee or rental basis 
revenue from these sources is recognized based on the contractual terms of the arrangement and is generally based on a share of money wagered  a share of the net winnings  or on a fixed daily rental rate basis

in certain markets  we also charge a daily system connection fee for the customer to connect to our central determination systems and or back office system 
we do not consider these arrangements to have multiple revenue generating activities as the services offered are a comprehensive solution in exchange for a daily fee and all of the products and services are delivered contemporaneously 
gaming equipment and systems revenue is generated from the sale of gaming devices and licenses of software  conversion kits  systems based hardware  services  and the licensing of computerized monitoring systems and related software maintenance fees 
we license our software on a perpetual basis or under time based licenses 
our time based licenses are generally for twelve month periods  and are bundled with software maintenance and product support fees 
software maintenance provides customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades  maintenance and patches released during the term of the support period 
the majority of our customers purchase both software and hardware maintenance and product support when they license software 
in addition  substantially all customers renew these maintenance agreements annually 
we sell or license our products and services individually or under arrangements in which there are multiple elements  such as a combination of gaming devices  system based hardware  software license fees  maintenance and product support fees and professional services 
effective july   we adopted new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition for multiple deliverable arrangements and certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
we elected to adopt this guidance prior to the required effective date using the prospective method 
accordingly  this guidance was applied to all new or materially modified revenue arrangements entered into since the start of our fiscal year of adoption  which is july  the guidance replaces and significantly changes the existing separation criteria for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements by eliminating the criterion for objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered products or services to determine a unit of accounting 
instead  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be allocated and recognized based on separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet both of the following criteria the delivered items have value to the customer on a standalone basis 
the item or items have value on a standalone basis if they are sold separately by any vendor or the customer could resell the delivered item s on a standalone basis  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
the guidance also eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation and requires  instead  that arrangement consideration be allocated  at the inception of the arrangement  to all deliverables based on their relative selling price ie  the relative selling price method 
when applying the relative selling price method  a hierarchy is used for estimating the selling price based first on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  then third party evidence tpe and finally management s estimate of the selling price esp 
in addition  the guidance amends the scope of software revenue recognition to exclude all tangible products containing both software and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
as a result  certain products that were previously accounted for under the scope of software revenue recognition guidance are no longer accounted for as software 
prior to july   we determined our gaming devices included software that was more than incidental to the product as a whole  accordingly  the sale of gaming devices were accounted for under the scope of software revenue recognition guidance 
application of the new guidance resulted in our determination that gaming devices no longer fall under the scope of software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  which applies to new or modified arrangements  revenue related to systems arrangements that contain software and nonsoftware deliverables require an allocation of the arrangement fee to the separate deliverables using the relative selling price method 
revenue for the software deliverables continue to be recognized under the software revenue recognition guidance  while revenue for the nonsoftware deliverables is no longer accounted for under the software revenue recognition guidance 
in allocating the arrangement fees to separate deliverables  we used a combination of vsoe of selling price and esp for gaming devices  maintenance and product support fees for perpetual licenses and professional services  a combination of vsoe and esp for system based hardware products  and esp for software products and maintenance and product support fees on time based licenses 
esp is determined based upon our normal pricing and discounting practices 
vsoe of selling price is measured based on the price for each deliverable when it is sold separately 
vsoe of selling price for software maintenance and product support fees sold with perpetual licenses are measured by the contractual renewal rate offered to the customer 
the impact of applying the new accounting guidance to new or materially modified arrangements entered into since july   is as follows for the year ended june  as reported pro forma basis as if the previous accounting guidance were in effect in s revenues gaming equipment systems gaming equipment and systems the impact on future periods is dependent upon the prevalence of multiple deliverable arrangements whereby a combination of gaming devices  hardware  software  maintenance and product support fees and consulting services are sold under one arrangement and the software license is time based 
under such arrangements  all revenue was previously recognized ratably over the term of the time based license as we were unable to establish vsoe of fair value for the software maintenance and product support  which runs contemporaneously with the license period 
under the new guidance  revenue from non software elements delivered under such multiple deliverable arrangements will no longer be deferred if vsoe of fair value does not exist for an undelivered element 
rather  the revenue allocated to the non software elements using the relative selling price method would be recognized upon delivery and customer acceptance  and only the revenue allocated to the software elements will be deferred and recognized over the term of the time based license 
the subjective and complex judgments for revenue recognition typically involve whether collectability is probable  whether fees under an arrangement are fixed or determinable and the identification of specific deliverables under multiple deliverable arrangements 
in addition  multiple elements arrangements must be analyzed to determine the relative fair value of each element  the amount of revenue to be recognized and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market value 
cost elements included in work in process and finished goods include raw materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
we regularly review inventory quantities and update estimates for the net realizable value of inventories due to the subjectivity involved in projecting sales volumes  used game sales values  refurbishment costs  and product demand 
this process includes examining the carrying values of new and used gaming devices  parts and ancillary equipment in comparison to the current fair market values for such equipment less costs to sell or dispose 
some of the factors involved in this analysis include the overall levels of our inventories  the current and projected sales levels for such products  the projected markets for such products  the costs required to sell the products  including refurbishment costs and importation costs for international shipments  and the overall projected demand for products once the next generation of products are scheduled for release 
as a result of our ongoing analysis of inventory  we recognized inventory write downs totaling million  and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
additional valuation charges could occur in the future as a result of changes in the factors listed above 
leased gaming equipment leased gaming equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from two to three and one half years 
the estimation of useful lives for our leased gaming equipment requires judgment and is based on the period of time over which we believe the assets will remain deployed 
given changes in technology  customer preferences and product demand  we review and evaluate the recoverability of our investment in such assets on a quarterly basis  as well as the estimated useful lives used to depreciate these assets 
there is the potential for acceleration of future depreciation  or asset impairments  if certain factors were determined to have an adverse impact on our ability to realize our full investment in such assets 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we review long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets are measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future  net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset  undiscounted and without interest 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
we review goodwill for impairment annually at the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter  or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or warrant a revision to the estimated remaining useful life 
we perform the impairment analysis of goodwill at a reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
we are required to make significant judgments and estimates regarding future cash flows  the determination of fair values and the identification of reporting units utilized in determining the fair value and recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill 
we believe our estimates are reasonable  however  if our estimates materially differ or factors utilized in developing our estimates change  different assumptions could materially affect our assessment of the fair value and recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill 
during the year ended june   impairment charges of million related to long lived assets were recorded see note to the consolidated financial statements  impairment charges 
during the years ended june  and  no impairment charges related to long lived assets were recorded 
during the years ended june   and  no impairment charges related to goodwill were recorded 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation based on the calculated fair value of the award measured on the grant date which is recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  as expense over the employee s requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected option term and the expected volatility of our common stock over the option s expected term 
we believe that the valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair values of stock options granted  however  if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate  and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
pre tax share based compensation expense from continuing operations was million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
as of june   there was million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of stock options which will be recognized over the subsequent years 
in addition  as of june   there was million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of restricted stock and restricted stock units rsus which will be recognized over the subsequent years 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
taxes on income of our foreign subsidiaries are provided at the tax rates applicable to the tax jurisdictions in which they are located 
on july   we adopted accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which creates a single model to address uncertainty in income tax positions which prescribed the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
under the guidance  we may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the issue 
the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that we believe has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
we are required to make significant judgments when evaluating our uncertain tax positions and the related tax benefits 
we believe our assumptions are reasonable  however  there is no guarantee that the final outcome of the related matters will not differ from the amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions based on changes in facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or changes in estimates 
our income tax provision may be impacted to the extent that the final outcome of these tax positions is different than the amounts recorded 
as of june  and  our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and million  respectively 
of this amount  million and million as of june  and  respectively  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate 
the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets is based in part on estimates of future income and the timing of temporary differences  and the failure to fully realize such deferred tax assets could result in a higher tax provision in future periods 
our net deferred tax assets from continuing operations totaled million and million at june  and  respectively 
our accrued income taxes payable totaled million and million and our accrued income taxes receivable totaled million and million at june  and  respectively 
we have classified million of the accrued income taxes receivable at june  as long term as we do not expect collection of these amounts in the next twelve months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of june   we had total debt outstanding of approximately million 
during the year  the interest rate for the revolving credit facility was subject to a leveraged based pricing grid 
we have minimal exposure to market interest rate risk because the variable interest rate on the term loan was effectively converted to a fixed rate as a result of the floating to fixed interest rate swap entered into in december and discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  long term debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk certain of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
during the years ended june  and  we recognized foreign currency exchange rate losses of approximately million and million  respectively  and a foreign currency exchange rate gain of approximately million for the year ended june  we estimate that a hypothetical strengthening or weakening of the us dollar for fiscal would have an immaterial impact on our business 
in addition  the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency translation gains and losses which are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheet 
such translation resulted in unrealized loss of million and million for fiscal and  respectively
