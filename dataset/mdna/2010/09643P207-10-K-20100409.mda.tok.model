business acquisition on august   we signed an agreement to purchase visalus  a direct seller of vitamins and other related nutritional supplements  through a series of investments 
on october   we completed the initial investment and acquired a equity interest in visalus for million in cash 
in addition  we may be required to make additional purchases of visalus equity interest to increase our equity ownership over time to  and 
these additional purchases were originally conditioned upon visalus meeting certain operating targets in calendar years  and however  visalus did not meet the operating threshold in so we were not required to make an additional purchase 
we have exercised our one time  one year extension and additional purch ases will be made if visalus meets certain operating targets in 
return to top calendar years  and we have the option to acquire the remaining interest in visalus even if they do not meet the predefined operating targets 
sale of mass channel candle business on april   we sold certain assets and liabilities of our bhi na mass channel candle business  which was part of the wholesale segment 
the net assets were sold for million  including proceeds from the sale of overstock inventory of million 
of this amount  million was received at closing and a total of million was received subsequently in fiscal the sale resulted in a pre tax loss of million  which was recorded in administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings loss in fiscal segments within the direct selling segment  the company designs  manufactures or sources  markets and distributes an extensive line of products including scented candles  candle related accessories and other fragranced products under the partylite brand

the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship to net sales and the percentage increase or decrease of certain items included in our consolidated statements of earnings loss percentage increase decrease from prior period percentage of net sales fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal years ended january net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling administrative operating profit n m n m earnings from continuing operations n m n m n m percent change from the prior year is not meaningful in concluding on our performance due to nonrecurring goodwill and other intangible impairments 

return to top fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales net sales decreased million  or approximately  from  million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease is a result of a decline in sales in partylite s north american businesses and overall declines in sales in our wholesale and catalog internet segments 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales within partylite s european markets 
net sales direct selling segment net sales in the direct selling segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal partylite s us sales decreased approximately compared to the prior year  due to the us economic recession  which led to lower consumer discretionary spending  a decline in partylite shows as well as a decrease in shows per consultant  all resulting in less opportunity to promote our products and recruit new consultants 
we increased promotional activities to attract and retain consultants  hostesses and guests to attend shows 
as a result  partylite s active independent us sales consultants remained approximately even on a year over year basis 
partylite canada reported a decrease compared to the prior year in us dollars  or on a local currency basis 
the sales decrease in canada is primarily due to the weak canadian economy which contributed to the decline in consultant base of and a decrease in partylite shows year over year 
in partylite s european markets  sales increased in us dollars  driven by strong sales in germany  france and austria 
on a local currency basis  partylite europe sales increased approximately  driven by an increase of approximately  consultants 
partylite europe represented approximately of partylite s worldwide net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal  reflecting the continued sales growth within the european markets 
net sales in the direct selling segment represented approximately of total blyth net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal net sales catalog internet segment net sales in the catalog internet segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sales decreased across all catalogs due to lower consumer discretionary spending  as well as a planned reduction in catalog circulation in an effort to reduce selling costs through more targeted catalog delivery 
net sales in the catalog internet segment accounted for approximately of total blyth net sales in fiscal and fiscal net sales wholesale segment net sales in the wholesale segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease is primarily a result of reduced sales within our home d cor  seasonal d cor and food service product lines  which have been adversely impacted by the weak housing market and overall economy 

return to top net sales in the wholesale segment represented approximately of total blyth net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal consolidated gross profit and operating expenses blyth s consolidated gross profit decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to the decrease in sales  partially offset by rigorous cost controls 
these efforts included consolidating some operations and workforce reductions  specifically related to distribution operations 
the gross profit margin decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily due to the impact of sales declining at a greater rate than promotional expenses  partially offset by cost reduction measures and a general decrease in most commodity costs  specifically wax products and dyethelene glycol deg 
blyth s consolidated selling expense decreased million  or approximately  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in selling expense is primarily the result of the reduced sales within the wholesale segment  partylite us and the catalog internet segment 
selling expense as a percentage of net sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal which is primarily a result of promotional initiatives in the direct selling segment to drive sales  partially offset by the consolidation of the sales and marketing operations of our seasonal and home d cor wholesale operations 
blyth consolidated administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decline is principally due to improved expense management on a year over year basis 
the consolidation of some of our operations has allowed us to reduce administrative costs 
the merger of the midwest and cbk operations within the wholesale segment resulted in an approximately reduction in that business unit s administrative expenses when compared to fiscal also contributing to the improvement is a million gain on a pension plan settlement 
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined slightly from approximately for fiscal to for fiscal impairment charges of million for goodwill and other intangibles were recognized in the catalog internet segment in fiscal  compared to a million impairment recorded in the direct selling segment in fiscal in fiscal and we reviewed the performance of the miles kimball and visalus businesses  respectively  and their projected outlooks 
both businesses experienced lower revenue growth and reduced operating margins than anticipated 
this shortfall in revenues and profit was primarily attributable to decreased consumer spending due to changes in the business environment and an overall weak economy 
as a result  the goodwill and intangibles in the catalog internet segment were determined to be impaired in fiscal and in the direct selling segment during fiscal blyth s consolidated operating profit increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to the decrease in goodwill and other intangibles impairments  partially offset by the impact of the decrease in sales 
operating profit direct selling segment operating profit in the direct selling segment decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal more than half of the decrease is attributable to the million goodwill and other intangible impairments related to visalus recorded in fiscal the remaining decline in operating income is attributable to a decline in operating income for partylite s us operations  primarily a result of the decrease in sales 
partially offsetting this decline is sales growth within partylite europe 

return to top operating loss catalog internet segment operating loss in the catalog internet segment decreased from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal the lower operating loss is primarily due to the nonrecurring goodwill and other intangibles impairments charges of million recorded during fiscal and a million gain as the result of the pension plan settlement realized during fiscal excluding the effect of these items  the operating loss would have been million last year as compared to million this year 
this improvement is principally due to the nonrecurring impact of erp implementation issues experienced in fiscal that increased shipping and customer service costs and cost reductions at the miles kimball company and boca java 
operating loss wholesale segment operating loss in the wholesale segment decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this reduction is primarily the result of a improvement in selling and administrative expenses across the segment  primarily due to the merger of the midwest and cbk operations 
this was offset by a decrease in sales across the segment due to a soft housing market and a continuing weak economy 
consolidated other expense income interest expense decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to the payoff of the matured senior notes during fiscal interest income decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to sharply lower interest rates earned on invested cash during fiscal foreign exchange and other losses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the loss recorded in fiscal includes million for the permanent impairment of our investment in redenvelope and a write down of million related to our preferred stock portfolio that was previously classified as a trading investment 
the loss in fiscal included a million loss on the sale of an auction rate security investment 
income tax expense increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in income tax expense was due primarily to a reduction in pretax losses in the united states and a million reduction in our unrecognized tax benefit reserve  partially offset by the tax impact of the non deductible portion of goodwill and other intangible impairments and impairments of investments for which a partial tax benefit was recorded 
the effective tax rate was a negative in fiscal as a result of our net loss compared to an expense of for the current year 
the net loss attributable to blyth  inc was million in fiscal compared to earnings of million in fiscal the improvement is primarily attributable to the million goodwill and intangibles impairments recorded during the third quarter of fiscal  partially offset by the million goodwill and intangibles impairment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal and lower sales in relation to the comparable prior year 
as a result of the foregoing  earnings from operations increased million  from a loss of million in fiscal to earnings of million in fiscal basic and diluted earnings loss per share from operations were for fiscal compared to income of and per share  respectively  for fiscal 
return to top fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales net sales decreased million  or approximately  from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal the decrease is a result of a decline in sales in partylite s north american businesses and overall declines in sales in our wholesale and catalog internet segments 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales within partylite s international markets 
net sales direct selling segment net sales in the direct selling segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal partylite s us sales decreased approximately compared to fiscal this decrease was driven by a decline in the number of sales consultants  which declined from over  as of january  to over  as of january   as well as fewer shows 
the reduction in sales consultants is partially the result of an increase in competition to attract and retain consultants due to more companies entering the direct selling channel 
additionally  the downturn in the us economy led to lower consumer discretionary spending  which resulted in fewer shows and opportunities to promote our products and recruit new consultants 
we initiated new and expanded means t o maintain our consultant count such as increased training and promotional initiatives 
partylite canada reported an approximately decrease for fiscal compared to fiscal in us dollars  or on a local currency basis 
the sales decrease in canada is primarily due to the decrease in its consultant base 
in partylite s european markets  sales increased approximately in us dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal  driven by strong sales in the newer markets  an increase of about  consultants and favorable foreign currency translation 
on a local currency basis  partylite europe sales increased approximately 
partylite europe represented approximately of partylite s worldwide net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal  reflecting the continued sales growth 
net sales in the direct selling segment represented approximately of total blyth net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal net sales catalog internet segment net sales in the catalog internet segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease is due to lower consumer discretionary spending  as well as order processing difficulties associated with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning erp system 
net sales in the catalog internet segment accounted for approximately of total blyth net sales in fiscal and net sales wholesale segment net sales in the wholesale segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease is a result of reduced sales within our home d cor and seasonal decor product lines  which were adversely impacted by the weak housing market 
in addition  sales were negatively impacted by million  as a result of the 
return to top sale of our mass channel candle business  which occurred at the end of the first quarter of fiscal net sales in the wholesale segment represented approximately of total blyth net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal consolidated gross profit and operating expenses blyth s consolidated gross profit decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to the decrease in sales  partially offset by efforts to control costs including reductions in workforce within the manufacturing and distribution operations and renegotiations of certain vendor and supplier contracts 
the gross profit margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase from fiscal is due in part to nonrecurring charges of million  or  relating to severance  inventory write downs and asset impairments in connection with the sale of bhi na during fiscal the balance of this increase was primarily due to the absence of bhi na sales in fiscal since bhi na operated at lower margins than blyth s other businesses in the prior year 
blyth s consolidated selling expense decreased million  or approximately  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in selling expense relates to the reduced sales in partylite us from million is fiscal to million in fiscal and the wholesale and catalog internet segments 
offsetting the impact in reduced sales were strategic initiatives undertaken by partylite to increase sales 
these initiatives include various independent consultant promotional programs aimed at increasing sales and recruiting new consultants 
selling expense as a percentage of net sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal overall  the increase in selling expense as a percent of sales is primarily a result of sales decreasing at a greate r rate than selling expenses 
blyth consolidated administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decline was principally due to severance related charges million and the termination of an office lease million taken during fiscal associated with the sale of bhi na  as well as improved expense management on a year over year basis 
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were approximately for fiscal and for fiscal impairment charges of million for goodwill and other intangibles were recognized in the catalog internet segment in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal in both years we reviewed the performance of the miles kimball business and its projected outlook 
the miles kimball business experienced lower revenue growth and reduced operating margins than anticipated during both fiscal and this shortfall in revenues and profit was primarily attributable to decreased consumer spending due to changes in the business environment  an overall weak economic climate and higher postage  paper and printing costs 
as a result  the goodwill and intangibles in the catalog internet segment were determined to be impaired in fiscal and further impaired in fiscal blyth s consolidated operating profit decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in sales partially offset by a corresponding decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of initiatives to maintain sales  as well as severance incurred due to reductions in personnel 

return to top operating profit direct selling segment operating profit in the direct selling segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in sales for partylite s north american operations and increased promotional costs of million 
partially offsetting this decline was an improvement in sales within partylite europe  including the positive effects of stronger foreign currencies 
operating loss catalog internet segment operating loss in the catalog internet segment increased by million  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal this increased loss was primarily due to the issues associated with the implementation of the new erp at the miles kimball company and continued lower consumer spending resulting from the weakening economy 
operating losses for fiscal and included goodwill and other intangibles impairments charges of million and million  respectively 
partially offsetting these charges were a reduction in losses at the boca java company of million  excluding the million goodwill impairment 
operating loss wholesale segment operating loss in the wholesale segment decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this reduction is primarily the result of the sale of the bhi na business in fiscal  which had contributed million in operating losses in the prior year  improving operating income this year by million 
this was partially offset by lower sales and profit across the segment due to a soft housing market and weakening economy 
consolidated other expense income interest expense decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in outstanding debt 
interest income decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  mainly due to lower amounts of cash and short term investments and lower interest rates during fiscal foreign exchange and other losses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the loss in fiscal includes a million impairment charge related to an available for sale equity investment in redenvelope  inc and a million impairment charge on an australian joint venture investment accounted for under the equity method 
the loss recorded in fiscal includes million for the permanent impairment of our investment in redenvelope and an unrealized loss of million related to our preferred stock portfolio that were classified as trading investments 
income tax expense decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to a pretax loss in the united states 
this decrease was offset by continued strong foreign sourced earnings as well as the tax impact of the non deductible portion of goodwill and other intangible impairments and impairments of investments for which no tax benefit was recorded 
the effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to a negative for fiscal as result of our net loss 
the fiscal rate reflects the strong foreign sourced earnings offset in part by the pretax loss in the united states and the partial benefit taken on the goodwill and intangible impairments in the catalog and internet segment 

return to top as a result of the foregoing  earnings from continuing operations decreased million  from million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal basic earnings per share from continuing operations were for fiscal compared to a loss of for fiscal diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were for fiscal compared to a loss of for fiscal seasonality historically  our operating cash flow for the first nine months of the fiscal year shows little if any positive cash flow  due to requirements for meeting working capital needs for inventory purchases and the extension of credit through the holiday season 
our fourth quarter  however  historically generated a surplus of cash resulting from a large concentration of our business occurring during the winter holiday season 
over one third of our total revenue was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  the cash provided by operations of million was significantly lower than previously experienced 
during both fiscal and fiscal  management took a number of actions to address this decline 
first  we began and continue to execute an aggressive working capital management program designed to conserve cash 
second  we have focused on cost cutting measures throughout the company with the goal to save cash 
third  we have altered the timing and level of dividends and treasury share buybacks and may continue to do so in the future 
these initiatives have supported our expectation that we will be able to fund our working capital requirements in the foreseeable future from cash flow from operations  as seen by the million in cash provided by operations in fiscal cash and cash equivalents increased million from million at january  to million at january   as a result of the aforementioned measures put in effect by management 
we typically generate positive cash flow from operations due to favorable gross margins and the variable nature of selling expenses  which constitute a significant percentage of operating expenses 
we generated million in cash from operations in fiscal compared to million in fiscal included in earnings in fiscal were non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  goodwill and other intangible impairments and amortization of unearned stock based compensation of million  million and million  respectively 
net changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of million in fiscal  primarily driven by a million reduction in inventories 
due to the seasonal nature of our businesses we generally do not have significant positive cash flow from operations until our fourth quarter 
our working capital needs are the highest in late summer prior to the start of the holiday season 
if demand for our products falls short of expectations  we could be required to maintain higher inventory balances than forecasted and could negatively impact our liquidity 
net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to a source of million in fiscal our investments decreased slightly from million as of january  to million at january   primarily through liquidations offset by the acquisition of short term certificates of deposit 
other sources of cash in fiscal were million received on the cash settlement of a net investment hedge and million received from the sale of assets 
net capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal we used cash of million during fiscal 
return to top to obtain our interest in visalus and the acquisition of certain assets of the as we change catalog 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the current year included the reduction of our long term debt and capital lease obligations by million  compared to long term debt and capital lease payments of million in the prior year 
during fiscal  we purchased treasury stock of million and paid dividends of million compared to million and million  respectively  in fiscal we will continue to carefully monitor our cash position  and will only make additional repurchases of outstanding debt or treasury shares and will only pay dividends when we have sufficient cash surpluses available to do so 
in addition to the united states  a significant portion of our operations are in western european nations  canada  australia and mexico 
a significant downturn in our business in these markets would adversely impact our ability to generate operating cash flows 
operating cash flows would also be negatively impacted if we experienced difficulties in the recruitment  retention and our ability to maintain the productivity of our independent consultants 
although there was a significant improvement in operating cash flow during fiscal  sales decreased in the partylite us market from the prior year by million  or  which was driven by lower activity by existing consultants and a lower number of partylite shows held resulting from difficult economic conditions 
management s key areas of focus have included stabilizing the consultant base through training and promotional incentives 
following several years of declines in consultant count in the united states fiscal represented a period of stability as the number of active independent sales consultants has increased slightly as a result of management efforts 
while we are making efforts to stabilize and increase the number of active independent sales consultants  it may be difficult to do so in the current economic climate due to reduced consumer discretionary spending 
if our us consultant count declines it will have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial results 
we anticipate total capital spending of approximately million for fiscal a major influence on the forecasted expenditures is our investment in the growth of the partylite european operations as well as investments in information technology systems 
we have grown in part through acquisitions and  as part of our growth strategy  we expect to continue from time to time in the ordinary course of business to evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities as appropriate 
we believe our financing needs in the short and long term can be met from cash generated internally 
information on debt maturities is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
on october   we acquired a interest in visalus for million and incurred acquisition costs of million for a total cash acquisition cost of million 
we intend to and may be required to purchase additional interests in visalus that will require additional capital resources  increasing our ownership to 
these additional purchases were originally conditioned upon visalus meeting certain operating targets in calendar years  and however  visalus did not meet the operating threshold in so we were not required to make an additional purchase 
we have exercised our one time  one year extension and additional purchases will be made if visalus meets certain operating targets in calendar years  and we have the option  but are not required  to acquire the remaining interest in visalus if they do not meet these operating targets 
if visalus meets its current projected operating targets  the total expected redemption value of the noncontrolling interest will be approximately million over calendar years  and the purchase prices of the additional investments are equal to a multiple of visalus earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and 
return to top amortization  exclusive of certain extraordinary items 
the payment  if any  will be out of existing cash balances and from expected future cash flows from operations 
united states and global credit and equity markets have undergone significant disruption in the past few years  making it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms 
in addition  equity markets are continuing to experience rapid and wide fluctuations in value 
if these conditions continue or worsen  our cost of borrowing may increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our businesses 
in addition  our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies 
a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing 
obtaining a new credit facility will more than likely require higher interest costs and may require our providing secu rity to guarantee such borrowings 
alternatively  we may not be able to obtain unfunded borrowings  which may require us to seek other forms of financing  such as term debt  at higher interest rates and additional expense 
in addition  if the economic conditions continue to worsen  we may be subject to future impairments of our assets  including accounts receivable  inventories  property  plant and equipment  investments  goodwill and other intangibles  if the valuation of these assets or businesses continues to decline 
as of january   we had a total of million available under an uncommitted facility with bank of america to be used for letters of credit through january  as of january   no letters of credit were outstanding under this facility 
in may  we filed a shelf registration statement for issuance of up to million in debt securities with the securities and exchange commission 
on september   we issued million of senior notes due october  at a discount of approximately million  which was amortized over the life of the notes 
during the first nine months of fiscal we repurchased million of these notes prior to their maturity date 
the final principal payments of million were made upon maturity 
on october   we issued million senior notes due on november  at a discount of approximately million  which is being amortized over the life of the notes 
such notes contain among other provisions  restrictions on liens on principal property or stock issued to collateralize debt 
as of january   we were in compliance with such provisions 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on may and november the notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at a specified redemption price 
the proceeds of the debt issuances were used for general corporate purposes 
as of january  and  miles kimball had approximately million and million  respectively  of long term debt including current portion outstanding under a real estate mortgage note payable  which matures on june  under the terms of the note  payments of principal and interest are required monthly at a fixed interest rate of 
as of january  and  midwest cbk had million  of long term debt outstanding under an industrial revenue bond irb  which matures on january  the bond is backed by an irrevocable letter of credit 
the loan is collateralized by certain of midwest cbk s assets 
the amount outstanding under the irb bears interest at short term floating rates  which on a weighted average was as of january  interest payments are required monthly and the principal is due upon maturity 

return to top as of january  visalus had million of long term debt outstanding related to notes payable to ram and visalus three founders 
under the terms of the notes  interest is accrued at a fixed interest rate of 
the estimated fair value of our million and million total long term debt including current portion at january  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the liability is determined using the fair value of its notes when traded as an asset in an inactive market and is based on current interest rates  relative credit risk and time to maturity 
the following table summarizes the maturity dates of our contractual obligations as of january  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations in thousands total year years years years long term debt capital leases interest purchase obligations operating leases unrecognized tax benefits total contractual obligations long term debt includes senior notes due november   a mortgage note payable maturity june   and an industrial revenue bond irb with a maturity date of january  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
amounts represent future lease payments  excluding interest  due on five capital leases  which end between fiscal and fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense on long term debt is comprised of million relating to senior notes  million in mortgage interest  thousand of interest due on the cbk industrial revenue bond  thousand relating to the visalus founder loans and approximately thousand of interest relating to future capital lease obligations 
purchase obligations consist primarily of open purchase orders for inventory 
unrecognized tax benefits consist of million which is expected to be realized within the next months  and million for which we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the potential future payments see note to the consolidated financial statements 
since january   we have purchased  shares on the open market  for a cost of million  bringing the cumulative total purchased shares to  as of january   for a total cost of approximately million 
additionally in fiscal   shares were repurchased through a dutch auction cash tender offer for an aggregate purchase price of million  including fees and expenses 
the acquired shares are held as common stock in treasury at cost 
on january   the company announced that it had declared a special cash dividend of per share of common stock  committing us to an million payment in february the dividend was payable to shareholders of record as of february   and was paid on february  during fiscal we paid a total of million in dividends  compared to million in fiscal the total dividends declared during fiscal were approximately million  which includes the million special dividend declared in january and paid in february our ability to pay cash dividends in the future is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to operate profitably and to generate significant cash flows from operations in excess of investment and financing requirements that may increase in the future to  for example  fund new acquisitions or retire debt 
as we normally do  we will review our dividend policy prior to our next dividend payment historically we have paid dividends in may and november  and may adjust the rate of our semi annual dividend if necessary 
we may also consider paying a sp ecial dividend around the end of fiscal as we determine the operating results of our seasonal businesses 

return to top we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to a have a material current or future effect upon our financial statements 
we utilize derivatives for operational purposes 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  sales adjustments  inventories  income taxes  restructuring and impairments  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results o f which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following are our critical accounting policies and methods 
revenue recognition revenues consist of sales to customers  net of returns and allowances 
we recognize revenue upon delivery  when both title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer 
we present revenues net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities 
generally  our sales are based on fixed prices from published price lists 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs  which may include special pricing agreements for specific customers  volume incentives and other promotions 
should market conditions decline  we may increase customer incentives with respect to future sales 
we also record reductions to revenue based primarily on historical experience  for estimated customer returns and chargebacks that may arise as a result of shipping errors  product damage in transit or for other reasons that can only become known subsequent to recognizing the revenue 
if the amount of actual customer returns and chargebacks were to increase significantly from the estimated amount  revisions to the estimated allowance would be required 
 in some instances  we receive payment in advance of product delivery 
such advance payments occur primarily in our direct selling and direct marketing channels and are recorded as deferred revenue in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets 
upon delivery of product for which advance payment has been made  the related deferred revenue is reversed and recorded as revenue 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for trade and note receivables 
the allowance is determined based on our evaluation of specific customers ability to pay  aging of receivables  historical experience and the current economic environment 
while we believe we have appropriately considered known or expected outcomes  our customers ability to pay their obligations  including those to us  could be adversely affected by declining retail sales resulting from such factors as contraction in the economy or a general decline in consumer spending 
some of our wholesale business units offer seasonal dating programs pursuant to which customers that qualify for such programs are offered extended payment terms for seasonal product sh ipments  which is a common practice in some of our channels 
the sales price for our products sold pursuant to such seasonal dating programs is fixed prior to the time of shipment to the customer 
customers do not have the right to return product  except for rights to return that 
return to top we believe are typical of our industry for such reasons as damaged goods  shipping errors or similar occurrences 
we are not required to repurchase products from our customers  nor do we have any regular practice of doing so 
we believe that we are reasonably assured of payment for products sold pursuant to such seasonal dating programs based on our historical experience with the established list of customers eligible for such programs 
if  however  product sales by our wholesale segment s customers during the seasonal selling period should fall significantly below expectations  such customers financial condition could be adversely affected  increasing the risk of not collecting these seasonal dating receivables and  possibly  resulting in additional bad debt charges 
we do not make any sales under consignment or s imilar arrangements 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolete  excess and unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions  customer planograms and sales forecasts 
if market acceptance of our existing products or the successful introduction of new products should significantly decrease  additional inventory write downs could be required 
potential additional inventory write downs could result from unanticipated additional quantities of obsolete finished goods and raw materials  and or from lower disposition values offered by the parties who normally purchase surplus inventories 
restructuring and impairment charges on long lived assets in response to changing market conditions and competition  our management regularly updates our business model and market strategies  including the evaluation of facilities  personnel and products 
future adverse changes in economic and market conditions could result in additional organizational changes and possibly additional restructuring and impairment charges 
historically  we have reviewed long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and other intangibles with definite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of such an asset might not be recoverable 
management determines whether there has been a permanent impairment on long lived assets held for use in the business by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flow from t he use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying value of the asset 
the amount of any resulting impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying value to the fair value  which may be estimated using the present value of the same cash flows 
long lived assets that meet the definition of held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying amount or net realizable value 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles we had approximately million and million of goodwill as of january  and  respectively 
goodwill is subject to an assessment for impairment using a two step fair value based test and as such other intangibles are also subject to impairment reviews  which must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles might be impaired 
we perform our annual assessment of impairment as of january  which is our fiscal year end date  or as deemed necessary 
for goodwill  the first step is to identify whether a potential impairment exists 
this first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
fair value for each of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a combination of valuation techniques  namely the discounted cash flow methodology and the market multiple methodology 
the fair value of the reporting units is derived using a combination of the outcome of the two valuation techniques described above and depends in part on whether 
return to top the market multiple methodology has sufficient similar transactions occurring in a recent timeframe 
the discounted cash flow methodology assumes the fair value of an asset can be estimated by the economic benefit or net cash flows the asset will generate over the life of the asset  discounted to its present value 
the discounting process uses a rate of return that accounts for both the time value of money and the investment risk factors 
the market multiple methodology estimates fair value based on what other participants in the market have recently paid for reasonably similar assets 
adjustments are made to compensate for differences between the reasonably similar assets and the assets being valued 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  no further analysis is necessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed 
the second step compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the estimated fair value of the goodwill 
if fair value is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is reported as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense 
our assumptions in the discounted cash flow methodology used to support recoverability include the reporting unit s five year business outlook 
the business outlook is a five year projection of the business unit s financial performance 
the business outlook includes the cash expected to be generated from the reporting unit based on certain assumptions for revenue growth  capital spending and profit margins 
this serves as the basis for the discounted cash flow model in determining fair value 
additionally  the discount rate utilized in the cash flow model values the reporting unit to its net present value taking into consideration the time value of money  other investment risk factors and the terminal value of the business 
for the terminal value  we used a multiple of earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiplied by a certain factor for which an independent third party would pay for a similar business in an arms length transaction 
in determining this factor we used information that was available for similar transactions executed in the marketplace 
the multiple of ebitda used contemplates  among other things  the expected revenue growth of the business  which in turn would require the use of a higher ebitda multiple if revenue were expected to grow at a higher rate than normal 
the following circumstances could impact our cash flow and cause further impairments to reported goodwill unexpected increase in competition resulting in lower prices or lower volumes  entry of new products into the marketplace from competitors  lack of acceptance of our new products into the marketplace  loss of a key employee or customer  significantly higher raw material costs  and a prolonged economic downturn other micro macroeconomic factors 
goodwill miles kimball as a result of our third quarter of fiscal impairment assessment  we determined that the goodwill related to the miles kimball reporting unit  in the catalog internet segment  was impaired 
the miles kimball company continued to experience substantial declines in operating performance when compared to prior years results and its strategic outlook 
we believe this shortfall in performance was primarily attributable to decreased consumer spending due to changes in the business environment and adverse economic conditions 
as a result of the impairment analysis performed  the goodwill was determined to be fully impaired  as the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value  including goodwill 
accordingly  we 
return to top recorded a non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million  which included the million related to as we change  during the third quarter of fiscal direct selling segment in the second quarter of fiscal  visalus  revised downward its revenues forecast for the current fiscal year as a result of lower demand for its product reflecting lower consumer spending attributed to the domestic economic recession and a higher than anticipated attrition rate in its distributor base 
these factors together have required management to focus its efforts on stabilizing its distributor base and curtailing its international expansion plans 
accordingly management has reduced its current year and long term forecasts in response to the weakening demand for its products 
the impairment analysis performed indicated that the goodwill in visalus was fully impaired  as its fair value was less than its carrying value  including goodwill 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million  du ring the second quarter of fiscal the january  impairment assessment of remaining million of goodwill within this segment indicates that it is fully recoverable 
other in august  we acquired a interest in boca java  a small gourmet coffee and tea company 
boca java sells its products primarily through the internet and is included in the catalog internet segment 
boca java represents a separate reporting unit and is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis 
we completed an impairment assessment during fiscal which indicated that the goodwill of million was fully impaired and recorded a charge to write off the goodwill 
significant assumptions if actual revenue growth  profit margins  costs and capital spending should differ significantly from the assumptions included in our business outlook used in the cash flow models  the reporting unit s fair value could fall significantly below expectations and additional impairment charges could be required to write down goodwill to its fair value and  if necessary  other long lived assets could be subject to a similar fair value test and possible impairment 
long lived assets represent primarily fixed assets and other long term assets excluding goodwill and other intangibles 
there are two main assumptions that are used for the discounted cash flow analysis first  the discount rate and second the terminal multiple 
this discount rate is used to value the gross cash flows expected to be derived from the business to its net present value 
the discount rate uses a rate of return to account for the time value of money and an investment risk factor 
for the terminal multiple  we used ebitda multiplied by a factor for which an independent third party would pay for a similar business in an arms length transaction 
in determining this factor we used information that was available for similar transactions executed in the marketplace 
the multiple of ebitda used contemplates  among other things  the expected revenue growth of the business which in turn would require the use of a higher ebitda multiple if rev enue were expected to grow at a higher rate than normal 
a change in the discount rate is often used by management to alter or temper the discounted cash flow model if there is a higher degree of risk that the business outlook objectives might not be achieved 
these risks are often based upon the business units past performance  competition  confidence in the business unit management  position in the marketplace  acceptance of new products in the marketplace and other macro and microeconomic factors surrounding the business 

return to top if management believes there is additional risk associated with the business outlook it will adjust the discount rate and terminal value accordingly 
the terminal value is generally a multiple of ebitda and is discounted to its net present value using the discount rate 
capital expenditures are included and are consistent with the historical business trend plus any known significant expenditures 
trade names and trademarks our trade name and trademark intangible assets related to our acquisitions of miles kimball and walter drake reported in the catalog internet segment and our acquisition of a controlling interest in visalus in october reported in the direct selling segment 
we had approximately million and million in trade names and trademarks as of january  and  respectively 
we perform our annual assessment of impairment for indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  which is our fiscal year end  or upon the occurrence of a triggering event 
we use the relief from royalty method to estimate the fair value for indefinite lived intangible assets 
the underlying concept of the relief from royalty method is that the inherent economic value of intangibles is directly related to the timing of future cash flows associated with the intangible asset 
similar to the income approach or discounted cash flow methodology used to determine the fair value of goodwill  the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is equal to the present value of after tax cash flows associated with the intangible asset based on an applicable royalty rate 
the royalty rate is determined by using existing market com parables for royalty agreements using an intellectual property data base 
the arms length agreements generally support a rate that is a percentage of direct sales 
this approach is based on the premise that the free cash flow is a more valid criterion for measuring value than book or accounting profits 
as a result of our fiscal impairment assessments  we determined that the recorded values of trade names and trademarks in the miles kimball reporting unit  in the catalog internet segment  were impaired 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal we performed additional impairment assessments due to changes in the business environment and adverse economic conditions currently experienced due to the continued decrease in consumer spending 
as a result of these impairment analyses performed  the trade names and trademarks in this reporting unit were determined to be impaired  as their fair value was less than their carrying value 
accordingly  we recorded non cash pre tax impairment charges of million and million in the third and fourth quarters  respectively of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal we performed impairment assessments due to adverse economic conditions currently experienced due to the continued decrease in consumer spending and a higher then expected distributor attrition rate 
we determined that the recorded values of trade names  trademarks and customer relationships within visalus  in the direct selling segment  were impaired 
as a result of these impairment analyses performed  the intangible assets were determined to be impaired  as their fair value was less than their carrying value 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment charge of million related to the trade names and trademarks and million related to customer relationships 
as of january  we performed our annual impairment analysis on the trade names and trademarks of the catalog internet and visalus assets 
the three primary assumptions used in the relief from royalty method are the discount rate  the perpetuity growth rate and the royalty rate 
this discount rate is used to value the expected net cash flows to be derived from the royalty to its net present value 
the discount rate uses a rate of return to account for the time value of money and an investment risk factor 
the perpetuity growth rate estimates the businesses sustainable long term growth rate 
the royalty rate is based upon past royalty performance as 
return to top well as the expected royalty growth rate using both macro and microeconomic factors surrounding the business 
a change in the discount rate is often used by management to risk adjust the discounted cash flow analysis if there is a higher degree of risk that the estimated cash flows from the indefinite lived intangible asset may not be fully achieved 
these risks are often based upon the business units past performance  competition  position in the marketplace  acceptance of new products in the marketplace and other macro and microeconomic factors surrounding the business 
if  however  actual cash flows should fall significantly below expectations  this could result in an impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
if the discount rate would have increased by and royalty rate would have decreased by  the estimated fair value of the trade names and trademarks within the catalog internet segment would have decreased the million recorded value by million to million 
if the discount rate would have increased by and the royalty rate would have decreased by  the estimated fair value of visalus trade names and trademarks within the direct selling segment would have decreased the million recorded value by million to million 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure state  federal and foreign  together with assessing permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property and equipment  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent we determine the need to establi sh a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we would include this as an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings loss 
management periodically estimates our probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business 
the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  as well as changes to or further interpretations of regulations 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that the tax rate may increase or decrease in any period 
amounts accrued for the tax uncertainties  primarily recorded in long term liabilities  total million and million at january  and  respectively 
accruals relate to tax issues for us federal  domestic state  and taxation of foreign earnings 
blyth s historical policy has been to consider its unremitted foreign earnings as not indefinitely invested except for amounts deemed required for working capital and expansion needs and as such provide deferred income tax expense on these undistributed earnings 
the company periodically reassesses whether the non us subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely 
as of january   we determined that million of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings were not reinvested indefinitely by our non us subsidiaries 
during fiscal  additional deferred income taxes of million were recorded as a reduction to our net earnings on these unremitted earnings 
in august  a state department of revenue proposed to assess additional corporate income taxes on us for fiscal years  and in the net amount of million  which 
return to top includes interest 
we filed a protest to the assessment and intend to contest it vigorously 
during fiscal  we established a reserve for this matter which we believe is adequate based on existing facts and circumstances 
the ultimate resolution of this matter could exceed our recorded reserve in the event of an unfavorable outcome of this matter 
it is reasonably possible that losses in excess of our recorded reserve could be incurred  however  we cannot estimate such a loss at this time 
impact of adoption of recently issued accounting standards we have reviewed all guidance issued but not implemented as of the filing date and have determined that only the following could or do have a significant affect on our financial statements 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu 
asu requires new disclosures regarding transfers in and out of the level and and activity within level fair value measurements and clarifies existing disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques for level and fair value measurements 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosure of activity within level fair value measurements  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interi m periods within those years 
this update will only have an impact on our disclosures beginning february  and will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
forward looking and cautionary statements certain statements contained in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  as discussed more fully elsewhere in this report and in our previous filings with the securities and exchange commission 

return to top item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we have operations outside of the united states and sell our products worldwide 
our activities expose us to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
these financial exposures are actively monitored and  where considered appropriate  managed by us 
we enter into contracts  with the intention of limiting these risks  with only those counterparties that we deem to be creditworthy  in order to also mitigate our non performance risk 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk on both variable rate debt and our investments in auction rate securities 
as of january   we are subject to interest rate risk on approximately million of variable rate debt 
a percentage point increase in the interest rate would not have a significant impact on pre tax earnings 
as of january   we held million of auction rate securities  at par value 
as the effective rate is below as of january  any decrease in the rate of return would not significantly impact pre tax earnings 
investment risk we are subject to investment risks on our marketable securities due to market volatility 
as of january  we held million in equity instruments which have been adjusted to fair value based on current market data 
foreign currency risk we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on foreign denominated inventory purchases  intercompany payables and certain foreign denominated loans 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we have  in the past  hedged the net assets of certain of our foreign operations through foreign currency forward contracts 
the net after tax gain related to the derivative net investment hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci during fiscal was million 
the after tax gain in aoci related to net investment hedges as of january  was million 
we have designated our forward exchange contracts on forecasted intercompany purchases and future purchase commitments as cash flow hedges and as such  as long as the hedge remains effective and the underlying transaction remains probable  the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of these contracts will be recorded in aoci until earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows being hedged 
with regard to commitments for inventory purchases  upon payment of each commitment  the underlying forward contract is closed and the corresponding gain or loss is transferred from aoci and is included in the measurement of the cost of the acquired asset 
if a hedging instrument is sold or terminated prior to maturity  gains and losses are deferred in aoci until the hedged item is settled 
howev er  if the hedged item is probable of no longer occurring  the resulting gain or loss on the terminated hedge is recognized into earnings immediately 
during fiscal the amount transferred to earnings was a loss of million 
the net after tax gain included in aoci at january  is million and is expected to be transferred into earnings within the next twelve months upon payment of the underlying commitment 

return to top we have designated our foreign currency forward contracts related to certain foreign denominated loans and intercompany payables as fair value hedges 
the gains or losses on the fair value hedges are recognized into earnings and generally offset the transaction gains or losses in the foreign denominated loans that they are intended to hedge 
for consolidated financial statement presentation  net cash flows from such forward contracts are classified in the categories of the consolidated statements of cash flows with the items being hedged 
forward contracts held with each bank are presented in a net asset or liability position based netting agreements with each bank
