these forward looking statements speak only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof  or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
the following presentation of management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading manufacturer of mechanical circulatory support products for use by patients with hf 
our vads are used primarily by hf patients to perform some or all of the pumping function of the heart 
we currently offer the widest range of products to serve this market 
we believe that our long standing reputation for quality and innovation  and our excellent relationships with leading cardiovascular surgeons and hf cardiologists worldwide  position us to capture growth opportunities in the expanding hf market 
through our wholly owned subsidiary itc  we design  develop  manufacture and market point of care diagnostic test systems and incision products that provide fast and accurate blood test results to improve patient management  reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 
our business model our business is comprised of two operating divisions cardiovascular and itc 
the product line of our cardiovascular division is circulatory support products 
our mechanical circulatory support products include the heartmate ii  heartmate xve  pvad  ivad and centrimag for acute  intermediate and long term mechanical circulatory support for patients with advanced hf 
we also manufacture and sell small diameter grafts using our proprietary materials to address the vascular access market for hemodialysis 
the product lines of our itc division are point of care diagnostics 
our point of care products include diagnostic test systems that monitor blood coagulation while a patient is being administered certain anticoagulants  as well as monitor blood gas electrolytes  oxygenation and chemistry status 
incision 
our incision products include devices used to obtain a patient s blood sample for diagnostic testing and screening for platelet function 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of  and any associated risks related to  these policies and estimates on our business operations are discussed below 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and assumptions 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales for our cardiovascular and itc business divisions when evidence of an arrangement exists  title has passed generally upon shipment or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
sales to distributors are recorded when title transfers 
we recognize sales of certain cardiovascular division products to first time customers when it has been determined that the customer has the ability to use the products 
these sales frequently include the sale of products and training services under multiple element arrangements 
training is not considered essential to the functionality of the products 
revenue under these arrangements is allocated to training based upon fair market value of the training  which is typically performed on our behalf by third party providers 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated to the training and the cardiovascular division products based on the relative fair market value of the training and products 
in determining when to recognize revenue  management makes decisions on such matters as the fair values of the product and training elements when sold together  customer credit worthiness and warranty reserves 
if any of these decisions proves incorrect  the carrying value of these assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets or the recorded product sales could be significantly different  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for any fiscal period 
reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments owed to us for product sales and training services 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the majority of our products are covered by up to a two year limited manufacturer s warranty from the date of shipment or installation 
estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded when the related sales are recognized and any additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated  at which time they are included in cost of product sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
in determining the warranty reserve estimate  management makes judgments and estimates on such matters as repair costs and probability of warranty obligations 
estimated excess and obsolete inventory charges are recorded when inventory levels exceed projected sales volume for a certain period of time 
in determining the excess obsolete charges  management makes judgments and estimates on matters such as forecasted sales volume 
if sales volume does not meet projections  additional write downs may be required 
management must make estimates and judgments to determine the amount of reserves to accrue 
if any of these decisions proves incorrect  our consolidated financial statements could be materially and adversely affected 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits and deductions  such as tax benefits from our non us operations and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents we believe we have provided adequate reserves for uncertain tax positions for anticipated audit adjustments by us federal  state and local  as well as foreign  tax authorities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes  interest and penalties may be due 
if events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the accrued liabilities are no longer warranted 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
evaluation of purchased intangible assets and goodwill for impairment we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  including intangible assets subject to amortization  when events or circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of a long lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the anticipated separately identifiable undiscounted cash flows to be generated by such an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
management must make estimates of these future cash flows  and if necessary  the approximate discount rate  and if any of these estimates proves incorrect  the carrying value of these assets on our consolidated balance sheets could become significantly impaired 
purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
if there is an impairment  a new fair value would be determined 
if the new fair value is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss would be recognized 
valuation of share based awards share based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of option awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  expected forfeitures and expected dividends 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes option pricing model for option grants is based on our historical volatility 
when establishing the expected life assumption  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in determining fair value  we use various approaches  including market  income and or cost approaches  and each of these approaches requires certain inputs 
fair value measurement standards establish a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions as compared to the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances 
the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
assets and liabilities utilizing level inputs include broker dealer quoted securities that are traded in an active market 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  a significant degree of judgment is not required 
level valuations based on quoted prices of similar investments in active markets  of similar or identical investments in markets that are not active or model based valuations for which all significant inputs and value drivers are observable  directly or indirectly 
assets and liabilities utilizing level inputs primarily include municipal bonds  variable demand notes  corporate bonds and our senior subordinated convertible notes  except the make whole provision  which uses level inputs  described below 

table of contents level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
assets and liabilities utilizing level inputs include auction rate securities  our convertible debenture with levitronix  our purchased intangible asset valuations and the make whole feature of our senior subordinated convertible notes 
given the current credit market illiquidity for auction rate securities  our estimates are subject to significant judgment by management 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measure 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  our own assumptions are developed to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
see note fair value measurements  to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our financial assets that are accounted for at fair value 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been obtained had an active market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
after determining the fair value of our available for sale securities  gains or losses on these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income  until either the investment is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary 
determining whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment 
for investments in available for sale securities  these judgments primarily consider our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity  more likely than not that we would be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investments amortized cost basis and whether we expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the investment 
given the current market conditions  these judgments could prove to be incorrect  and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations 
in addition  if we decide not to hold an investment until its value recovers it may result in the recognition of an other than temporary impairment 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated and as a percentage of total product sales fiscal years in thousands  except percentages product sales cost of product sales gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of purchased intangible assets total operating expenses income loss from operations other income and expense interest expense interest income and other income loss before taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss includes non cash interest expense of million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 

table of contents product sales product sales consisted of the following fiscal years annual percentage change in thousands cardiovascular itc total product sales in as compared to  cardiovascular product sales increased by million primarily due to higher sales driven by increased heartmate ii volume in north america and europe and the launch of go gear peripherals in the third quarter of  partially offset by the decline in stocking revenues as nineteen new heartmate ii centers were added in as compared to fifty five new heartmate ii centers in the increases in product sales were partially offset by a decline in the sales of the heartmate xve and thoratec product lines as a result of cannibalization by heartmate ii and unfavorable foreign exchange rates 
itc product sales decreased by million primarily due to delayed capital purchases by hospitals due to current economic conditions and competitive pressures on the protime and skin incision businesses  partially offset by an increase in sales to customers for pharmaceutical clinical trials 
in as compared to  cardiovascular product sales increased by million primarily due to higher sales from our heartmate product line 
the higher sales resulted from increased heartmate ii volume in north america and europe  a commercial price increase for the heartmate ii in north america  and higher stocking revenue associated with the addition of fifty five new heartmate ii centers 
also  product sales increased because of favorable foreign currency translation and higher centrimag sales due to increased implant activity 
this increase in product sales was partially offset by a decline in the sales of the thoratec product line due to heartmate ii cannibalization 
itc product sales increased by million primarily due to higher domestic and international sales of our hemochron product line and higher international sales of our alternate site product line  partly offset by the decrease of our incision product line sales due to competitive offerings affecting both volume and selling price 
sales originating outside of the us and us export sales accounted for approximately  and of our total product sales in  and  respectively 
gross profit gross profit and gross margin were as follows fiscal years annual percentage change in thousands total gross profit total gross margin in as compared to  the cardiovascular gross margin percentage decreased by primarily due to an increase in inventory write downs  warranty reserves and unfavorable foreign exchange rates partially offset by increased heartmate ii volume and favorable manufacturing variances 
itc gross margin percentage decreased by due to unfavorable geographic and product mix and increase in unfavorable manufacturing variances 
the division specific gross margin decreases were partially offset by a mix shift between the cardiovascular and itc division as the cardiovascular division becomes a larger percentage of revenue 
in as compared to  cardiovascular gross margin percentage increased by primarily due to increased heartmate ii prices in north america and favorable foreign currency translations  partially offset by the increased percentage of non pump revenue and unfavorable manufacturing variances 
itc gross margin percentage decreased by due to unfavorable geographic and product mix and increased unfavorable manufacturing variances 

table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were as follows fiscal years annual percentage change in thousands total selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to  cardiovascular costs increased by million  primarily due to market development initiatives associated with the launch of go gear peripherals and the preparation for heartmate ii destination therapy approval and higher stock based compensation expense partially offset by lower bonus and commission expense 
itc costs increased by million  primarily due to higher costs for quality system improvements offset by lower personnel costs 
corporate costs increased by million  primarily due to million related to the heartware transaction  partially offset by lower compensation costs 
in as compared to  cardiovascular costs increased by million  primarily due to market development initiatives and commercialization efforts associated with the heartmate ii and higher compensation expense 
itc costs increased by million  primarily due to higher sales and marketing personnel and travel costs 
corporate costs increased by million  primarily due to higher compensation  and other corporate expenses 
research and development research and development expenses were as follows fiscal years annual percentage change in thousands total research and development expenses research and development costs are largely project driven  and fluctuate based on the level of project activity planned and subsequently approved and conducted 
in as compared to  research and development costs increased million 
cardiovascular costs increased by million  primarily due to increased research and development costs associated with the heartmate product line peripheral enhancements and new product technology 
itc costs decreased by million due to lower spending related to new product development activities 
in as compared to  research and development costs increased by million 
cardiovascular costs increased by million  primarily due to increased research and development costs associated with our heartmate product line peripheral enhancements and new product technology 
itc costs increased by million  primarily due to new product development 
amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of purchased intangible assets in was million as compared to million in the decrease in amortization of million is attributable to certain intangible assets at the cardiovascular division being fully amortized in the first quarter of amortization of purchased intangible assets in was million as compared to million in the million increase resulted from decreasing the estimated useful lives of certain of our intangible assets at our cardiovascular division in 
table of contents interest expense interest expense primarily relates to interest on the senior subordinated convertible notes as follows fiscal years annual percentage change in thousands interest expense amortization of debt issuance costs related to senior subordinated convertible notes total interest expense interest income and other interest income and other consisted of the following fiscal years annual percentage change in thousands interest income foreign currency  net other total interest income and other in  interest income declined by million as compared to  primarily due to decline in market interest rates and shortened maturities on our investment portfolio  partially offset by higher investment balances 
foreign currency decreased by million in as compared to due to certain foreign currency transactions related to inventory for our foreign operations  which are not hedged in our foreign currency contracts 
other income increased by million in as compared to primarily due to an increase in royalty income 
in  interest income increased by million as compared to  primarily due to higher investment balances in our portfolio and increase in market interest rates 
foreign currency decreased by million in as compared to due to certain foreign currency transactions related to inventory for our foreign operations  which are not hedged in our foreign currency contracts 
income taxes our effective tax rate was an expense of in compared to an expense of in this increase in the annual effective tax rate of was primarily due to an increase in pre tax income  lower tax exempt interest and non deductible compensation  in part offset by a change in state apportionment rates 
our effective tax rate was an expense of in compared to a benefit of in the increase in our annual effective tax rate of on a comparative basis was primarily due to a significant increase in operating profit  and an increase in reserves related to domestic income tax positions 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investments cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid financial instruments that are readily convertible to cash and have maturities of days or less from the date of purchase 
investments classified as short term consist of various financial instruments such as commercial paper  us government agency obligations and corporate notes 
bonds with high credit quality with maturities of greater than days when purchased are classified as available for sale 
investments classified as long term consist of our investments in auction rate securities 

table of contents following is a summary of our cash  cash equivalents and investments january  january  december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term available for sale investments long term available for sale investments total cash and equivalents and available for sale investments we believe that cash and cash equivalents  short term available for sale investments on hand and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations  capital requirements and stock repurchase programs for at least the next twelve months 
as of january   we owned approximately million face amount of auction rate securities  of which million was classified as short term and million was classified as long term 
the assets underlying these investments are student loans backed by the us government under the federal family education loan program or by private insurers and are rated between a and aaa 
historically  these securities have provided liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate periodically every seven to thirty five days 
beginning in february of  these auctions began to fail 
the principal amount of these auction rate securities will not be accessible until future auctions for these securities are successful  a secondary market is established  these securities are called for redemption  or they are paid at maturity 
we recorded an estimated cumulative unrealized loss of million million  net of tax related to the temporary impairment of the auction rate securities  which was included in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss within shareholders equity 
in addition  our management reviews impairments and credit loss associated with its investments  including auction rate securities to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary and to bifurcate the credit and non credit component of an other than temporary impairment event 
we do not intend to sell any of the auction rate securities prior to maturity at an amount below the original purchase value  intend to hold the investment to recovery and based on a more likely than not probability assessment we will not be required to sell the security before recovery  and deem that it is not probable that we will receive less than of the principal and accrued interest from the issuer 
therefore  of the impairment was charged to other comprehensive income 
further  we continue to liquidate investments in auction rate securities as opportunities arise 
during the fiscal year ended january   million in auction rate securities were liquidated at par in connection with issuer calls 
we continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities and consider its impact if any on the fair value of our investments 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in fair values does not occur  we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income or other than temporary impairment charges to the consolidated statements of operations in future periods 
we intend and have the ability to hold these auction rate securities until the market recovers or until maturity 
we do not anticipate having to sell these securities in order to operate our business 
we believe that  based on our current unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable security balances of million as of january   the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets will not have an impact on our liquidity  our cash flow or our ability to fund our operations 
if the issuers of the auction rate securities are unable to successfully complete future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
it could conceivably take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments recorded value 

table of contents long term obligation in  we completed the sale of million initial principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes due in the senior subordinated convertible notes were issued at an issue price of per note  which is of the principal amount at maturity of the notes 
the senior subordinated convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per year on the principal amount at maturity  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on may and november of each year  from november  until may  we have applied  retrospectively  the adoption of recent guidance for the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial settlements  which increases non cash interest expense based on the assumed market rate of percent per annum as compared to the cash coupon rate of as further discussed in note  long term debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
holders of the senior subordinated convertible notes may convert their convertible notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes  which represents a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events as set forth in the indenture 
holders have been and are able to convert their convertible notes at any point after the close of business on october  if  as of the last day of the preceding calendar quarter  the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of such preceding calendar quarter is more than of the accreted conversion price per share of our common stock 
commencing october   this market price conversion feature was satisfied  such that holders of the senior subordinated convertible notes may convert their notes through the final maturity date of the notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes  subject to adjustments as provided in the indenture 
if holders elect conversion  we may  at our option  deliver shares of common stock  pay a holder in cash  or deliver a combination of shares and cash  as determined pursuant to the terms of the notes 
cash flow activities following is a summary of our cash flow activities fiscal years in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities in  cash provided by operating activities was million 
this amount included net income of million increased by positive non cash adjustments to net income of million primarily comprised of million related to depreciation  million related to amortization  million related to share based compensation expenses  and million of tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options 
these positive non cash contributions were partially offset by a decrease of million related to excess tax benefits from share based compensation and a decrease of million in our net deferred tax liability 
changes in assets and liabilities used additional cash of million primarily due to the increase in receivables  inventory and a decrease in accounts payable  partially offset by an increase in income taxes 
cash provided by or used in investing activities in  cash used in investing activities was million  due to net purchases of investments of million  issuance of heartware loan of million  purchase of a patent portfolio for million  and purchases of property  plant and equipment of million  net of million in transfers of rental drivers and demonstration equipment from inventory into fixed assets 
this was offset in part by million of loan collections 
the purchased property  plant and equipment included million primarily for leasehold and building improvements related to the expansion of our manufacturing facility and the office building at our pleasanton headquarters and purchases of management information systems equipment at our cardiovascular division and million for manufacturing equipment and management information systems equipment at our itc division 

table of contents cash provided by financing activities in  cash provided by financing activities was million  which was primarily comprised of million in proceeds related to stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and million from excess tax benefits from share based compensation 
this was partially offset by million of restricted stock purchased for payment of income tax withholding due upon vesting 
off balance sheet arrangements letter of credit we maintain an irrevocable standby letter of credit as part of our workers compensation insurance program 
the letter of credit is not collateralized 
the letter of credit automatically renews on june th of each year  unless terminated by one of the parties 
as of january   our letter of credit balance was approximately million 
contractual obligations as of january   we had the following contractual obligations total thereafter in millions long term debt obligations a operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c total a includes interest of million and original issue discount of million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k related to our long term debt 
b our operating lease obligations of million were comprised of our various leased facilities and office equipment 
c our purchase obligations include million of supply agreements in effect at january  as of january   the liability for uncertain tax positions was million including interest and penalties 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards updates asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
asu no 
amends asc and clarifies and provides additional disclosure requirements related to recurring and non recurring fair value measurements and employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
this asu became effective for us on january  we do not currently anticipate that this asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  which amends asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
asu no 
addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how to allocate consideration to each unit of accounting in the arrangement 
this asu replaces all references to fair value as the measurement criteria with the term selling price and establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
asu no 
also eliminates the use of the residual value method for determining the allocation of arrangement consideration 
additionally  asu no 
requires expanded disclosures 
this asu will become effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after the fiscal year earlier application is permitted with required transition disclosures based on the period of adoption 
we are currently evaluating the application date and the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent  which amends asc  fair value measurements and disclosures overall 
asu no 
permits a reporting entity to measure the fair value of certain alternative investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value on the basis of the investments net asset value per share or its equivalent 
this asu also requires expanded disclosures 
this guidance became effective for us on october  and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption  however  it may impact the valuation of our future investments 
on july   we adopted asu no 
 topic generally accepted accounting principles  which amended asc  generally accepted accounting principles  to establish the asc as the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
on the effective date  the asc superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all previous references to the superseded standards in our consolidated financial statements have been replaced by references to the applicable sections of the asc 
the adoption of these sections did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  we adopted asc  investments debt and equity securities  to modify the existing impairment model with respect to debt securities falling within the scope of investments for debt and equity securities 
asc defines whether an other than temporary impairment otti will have occurred when either i an entity has the intent to sell an impaired security  ii it is more likely than not that an entity will be required to sell an impaired security prior to its anticipated recovery in value  or iii an entity does not expect to recover the entire cost basis of an impaired security 
in addition  asc modifies the manner in which an otti is measured and presented on the statement of operations and requires expanded disclosures 
asc was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  but resulted in additional disclosure requirements about our investments 
see note  investments for further discussion 
on january   we adopted asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  which provides a consistent definition of fair value that focuses on exit price  prioritizes the use of market based inputs over entity specific inputs for measuring fair value and establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements 
on january   we adopted the applicable sections of asc for financial assets and financial liabilities and for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are remeasured at least annually 
at that time  we elected to defer adoption of asc for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
on january   we adopted the sections of asc regarding nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
the applicable sections of asc were applied prospectively 
the adoption of the various sections of asc is disclosed in note  fair value measurements 
on january   we adopted the applicable sections of asc  business combinations  which provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired  liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination 
additionally  this asc provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
asc amends the applicable sections of asc  income taxes  such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies related to acquisitions made prior to january  also fall within the scope of these sections 
during the fiscal year ended  we expensed approximately million of transaction costs recorded to selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations related to the merger agreement with heartware international inc heartware 
the company and heartware mutually agreed effective july  to terminate the definitive merger agreement pursuant to which we would have acquired heartware 
on january   we adopted the applicable sections of asc  risks and uncertainties  and asc  intangibles goodwill and other  that address the determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
these sections address the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the adoption of these applicable sections did not have a material impact our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investment portfolio is made up of marketable investments in money market funds  auction rate securities  us treasury securities and debt instruments of government agencies  local municipalities  and high quality corporate issuers 
all investments are carried at market value and are treated as available for sale 
investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature due to the frequency with which the interest rate is reset and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
our holdings of the securities of any one issuer  except government agencies  do not exceed of the portfolio 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a loss if we choose or are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
if interest rates were to rise or fall from current levels by basis points  the change in our net unrealized loss on investments would be million 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risks 
our senior subordinated convertible notes do not bear interest rate risk as the notes were issued at a fixed rate of interest 
as of january  we owned approximately million of auction rate securities  which is part of our investment portfolio 
the assets underlying these auction rate securities are student loans which are aaa or a rated  and backed by the us government under the federal family education loan program or private insurers 
historically  these securities have provided liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate  periodically every seven to thirty five days 
beginning in february of  these auctions began to fail 
although we have realized at or below market interest rates for many of these auction rate securities than we otherwise would have  the principal amount will not be accessible until future auctions for these securities are successful  a secondary market is established  or these securities are called for redemption 
therefore  our auction rate securities are classified as long term and are valued at million  net of a million impairment  using significant unobservable inputs  with the exception of million which was classified as short term investment 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity of these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we use forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate the gains and losses generated by the re measurement of non functional currency assets and liabilities primarily assets and liabilities on our uk subsidiary s consolidated balance sheet that are not denominated in uk pounds 
our contracts typically have maturities of three months or less
