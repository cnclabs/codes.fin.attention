fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  overview 
during  our sales declined and organic sales declined 
we believe this decline is in part associated with the widely reported general economic downturn and credit crisis 
sales to customers in our facilities maintenance end market  which makes up of our total sales and includes multi family housing and institutional mro customers  declined during compared to sales to our professional contractor customers  which represent of our total sales  declined 
sales to our specialty distributor customers  which represent of our total net sales  declined 
demand from our professional contractor and specialty distributor customers continues to be impacted by the prolonged declines in residential new construction and renovations activity 

table of contents net income as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in the decline in net income is a result of lower sales and gross margins  and the costs associated with our previously announced operational initiatives  such as employee separation benefits  closing of underperforming professional contractor showrooms  consolidation of certain distribution centers and higher bad debt expense 
these higher costs were offset in part by decreases in compensation and fringe benefits  lower delivery costs and lower interest expense associated with lower debt balances outstanding and lower interest rates 
as part of our efforts to manage and control costs  we implemented a freeze on salary increases for all non warehouse personnel and discontinued matching employees contributions to our qualified profit sharing plan under section k of the internal revenue code for the year ended december  previously  we matched employee contributions at a rate of of the first of the employee s base salary up to the statutory maximum of  per employee 
during  contributions to the k plan were million 
effective december   the first day of our fiscal year  we reinstituted merit based salary increases and the matching of employee contributions to our qualified profit sharing plan at a rate of of the first of the employee s base salary up to the statutory maximum of  per employee 
however  in light of the current economic conditions  we plan to continue to evaluate the cost and benefits associated with these cost control measures 
we will also continue to focus on keeping our operating costs low in the near term while continuing to invest in our operating platform for the long term 
accordingly  in addition to the operational initiatives such as headcount reductions  the closing of underperforming professional contractor showrooms and the consolidation of distribution centers  some of which have been completed  our plans include continued investments in the consolidation of our distribution network and in information technology solutions to optimize customer service

we expect sales to our facilities maintenance  professional contractor and specialty distributor end markets to remain relatively weak during as the general economic downturn and credit crisis is expected to continue specifically with respect to the housing market 
we expect continued variability within our end markets  however  we believe the impact on sales related to the market weakness during will be less severe than we experienced during gross profit
