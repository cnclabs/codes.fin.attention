background and overview we design  develop  market and support high performance  object oriented database management solutions and provide related maintenance and professional services 
our products and services address the complex data management needs of enterprises and providers of products requiring data management functions 
our products and services collectively comprise our single operating segment  which we call data management 
our end user customers typically use our products to manage data for business systems and to enable these systems to access and integrate data necessary for the customers data management applications 
our data management products and services offer customers the ability to manage real time  xml and other types of hierarchical and navigational data 
we believe that by using our data management solutions  customers cut their hardware costs  accelerate and simplify their development efforts  significantly reduce administration costs and deliver products and services with a significant competitive edge 
our data management business is currently comprised of the following key products versant object database or vod  previously known as vds  an eighth generation object oriented database management system that is used in high performance  large scale  real time commercial applications in distributed computing environments 
we also offer several optional ancillary products for use with versant object database to extend its capabilities  provide compatibility and additional protection of stored data 
fastobjects  an object oriented database management system that can be embedded as a high performance component into customers applications and systems 

table of contents dbo  an open source object oriented database software solution targeted towards the embedded device market 
our versant object database product offerings are used primarily by larger organizations  such as technology providers  telecommunications carriers  government defense agencies  defense contractors  healthcare companies and companies in the financial services and transportation industries  each of which have significant large scale data management requirements 
with the incorporation of the fastobjects solution into our product line following our march merger with poet holdings  inc  we expanded the scope of our solutions to also address the data management needs of smaller business systems 
by our recent acquisition of dbo in december  we further expanded the scope of our solutions to include the embedded market 
our customers data management needs can involve many business functions  ranging from management of the use and sharing of a company s internal enterprise data to the processing of externally originated information such as customer enrollment  billing and payment transaction data 
our solutions have also been used to solve complex data management issues such as fraud detection  risk analysis and yield management and can be adapted for use with many different applications 
in addition to our product offerings  we provide maintenance and technical support services to assist users in using our products 
we also offer a variety of consulting and training services to assist users in developing and deploying applications based on versant object database  fastobjects and dbo 
we license our products and sell associated maintenance  training and consulting services to end users through our direct sales force and through value added resellers  systems integrators and distributors 
in addition to these products and services  we resell related software developed by third parties 
to date  substantially all of our revenues have been derived from the following data management products and related services sales of licenses for versant object database and fastobjects  maintenance and technical support services for our products  consulting and training services  nonrecurring engineering fees received in connection with providing services associated with versant object database  the resale of licenses  and maintenance  training and consulting services for third party products that complement versant object database  reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses  which we incurred and are recorded as revenues in our statements of income 
continued adverse global economic conditions are negatively impacting our business the national and global economies and financial markets have continued to experience a severe downturn stemming from a multitude of factors  including adverse credit conditions  slower economic activity  concerns about failures or the instability of major financial institutions and other businesses  inflation and deflation  high rates of unemployment  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions  liquidity concerns and other factors 
as a result of these conditions  the united states and global economies are in a significant recession  which may continue for a significant length of time 
the severity of these economic and financial market conditions and the length of time they may persist are unknown 

table of contents our business has been negatively affected by these ongoing worldwide economic conditions 
it is unclear when the macroeconomic environment may improve 
during fiscal year  our selling environment remained very challenging  causing customers to delay or reduce technology purchases or to make smaller investments in our solutions 
we are seeing continuing pressures on our customers budgets  and while facing uncertainty and cost pressures in their own businesses  some of our customers are deferring purchases of our products 
the difficult and uncertain economic conditions caused some of our customers to face financial challenges during fiscal and they may continue to face such challenges for the foreseeable future 
the current economic downturn in our customers industries has contributed to the recent substantial reduction in our revenue  particularly our license revenue  and could continue to harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
financial highlights for fiscal our net revenues in fiscal were million  a decrease of million or from net revenues of million in fiscal this decrease in revenues was primarily due to fewer license transactions and the relative absence of larger license transactions 
in  license revenues have been negatively impacted by the weakened global economy 
no customer accounted for more than of total revenues for the fiscal year 
we depend heavily on our installed customer base for future revenues from maintenance renewal fees 
net income for fiscal was million compared to a net income of million in fiscal net income from continuing operations for fiscal was million compared to net income from continuing operations of million in fiscal the decrease in net income from continuing operations in fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in our revenues  and was partially offset by operating expense reductions and a decrease in the provision for income taxes 
the decrease in or the provision for income taxes resulted primarily from an adjustment that represented management s judgment of the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets 
our combined sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative and restructuring expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of million or from million reported in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to an approximately million decrease in our general and administrative expenses  partially offset by an approximately  increase in sales and marketing expenses during fiscal cash provided by operations in fiscal was million compared to million of cash provided by operations in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal was primarily due to an approximately million reduction in operating income offset by a decrease in trade accounts receivable 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million compared to  in fiscal the increase in cash used in investing activities was related to our acquisition of the dbo assets 
cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million compared to cash provided of  in fiscal the increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal was due to our use of approximately million to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our fiscal stock repurchase program  together with a decrease in the proceeds we received from issuance of common stock 
during fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by  to million at october  compared to million at october  
table of contents fiscal and beyond during fiscal  we focused our sales and marketing efforts on our data management products  versant object database  fastobjects and dbo and on related maintenance  consulting and training services 
versant object database was the key focus of our marketing efforts and the major source of our license and service revenues in fiscal we again expect to derive most of our revenues in fiscal from versant object database  fastobjects and dbo licenses and related services 
on december  we acquired the assets of the database software business of privately held servo software  inc formerly dbobjects  inc for million in cash 
dbo is an open source object database software solution targeting the embedded device market 
it is distributed under free open source licenses to a large  open source community of approximately  registered members located around the world  and in some cases is licensed on a fee bearing basis to certain customers for redistribution 
like many other software companies  we do not operate with a significant backlog of orders 
our license revenues  in particular  are difficult to forecast 
the outlook into the company s anticipated performance in fiscal is more uncertain than in prior years  due principally to the recent significant worldwide recession 
in addition  versant has plans to increase its sales and marketing spending levels by approximately in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
the company expects to recognize benefits from these additional sales and marketing expenditures over the medium term  and currently expects its total revenues in fiscal year to be essentially unchanged from its fiscal year total revenues of million 
due to the projected increased spending in sales and marketing and anticipated sox compliance costs  the company is currently projecting income from operations of approximately million for fiscal year without limitation  the estimates  forecasts and other statements in this paragraph are forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period covered by our financial statements 
we base these estimates and judgments on information reasonably available to us  such as our historical experience and trends  industry  economic and seasonal fluctuations and on our own internal projections that we derive from that information 
although we believe our estimates to be reasonable under the circumstances  there can be no assurances that such estimates will be accurate given that the application of these accounting policies necessarily involves the exercise of subjective judgment and the making of assumptions regarding many future variables and uncertainties 
we consider critical those accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  and income taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  as set forth in accounting standards codification asc  software  revenue recognition  formerly known as and comprised of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  sop and modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  
table of contents asc  revenue recognition  construction type and production type contracts  formerly known as sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
our revenues consist mainly of revenues earned under software license agreements  maintenance support agreements otherwise known as post contract customer support or pcs and  to a lesser degree  agreements for consulting and training activities 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered by us at a future date 
if there is an undelivered element under the license arrangement  we defer revenues based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered element  as determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements of a transaction  we defer all revenues from that transaction until sufficient evidence of the fair value exists or until all elements have been delivered 
under the residual method  discounts are allocated only to the delivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  with any undelivered elements being deferred based on the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of such undelivered elements 
we typically do not offer discounts on future undeveloped products 
revenues from software license arrangements  including prepaid license fees  are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
delivery has occurred and there are no future deliverables except pcs 
the fee is fixed and determinable 
if we cannot conclude that a fee is fixed and determinable  then assuming all other criteria have been met  we recognize the revenues as payments become due in accordance with asc collection is reasonably assured 
if an acceptance period or other contingency exists  revenues are not recognized until customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period  or until satisfaction of the contingency  as applicable 
our license fees are generally non cancelable and non refundable 
also  our customer agreements for prepaid deployment licenses do not make payment of our license fees contingent upon the actual deployment of the software 
therefore  a customer s delay or acceleration in its deployment schedule does not impact our revenue recognition in the case of a prepaid deployment license 
revenues from related pcs for all product lines are usually billed in advance of the service being provided and are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term in which the pcs is to be performed  which is generally twelve months 
in some cases pcs revenues are paid in arrears of the service being provided and are recognized as revenues at the time the customer provides a report to us for deployments made during a given time period 
training and consulting revenues are recognized when a purchase order is received  the services have been performed and collection is deemed probable 
consulting services are billed on an hourly  daily or monthly rate 
training classes are billed based on group or individual attendance 
we categorize our customers into two broad groups  end users and value added resellers vars 
end user customers are companies who use our products internally and do not redistribute our product outside of their corporate organizations 
var customers include traditional value added resellers  systems integrators  original equipment manufacturers oems and other vendors who redistribute our products to their external third party customers  either separately or as part of an integrated product 

table of contents we license our data management products through two types of perpetual licenses development licenses and deployment licenses 
development licenses are typically sold on a per seat basis and authorize a customer to develop and test an application program that uses our software product 
prior to an end user customer being able to deploy an application that it has developed under our development license  it must purchase deployment licenses in which the license fees are based on the number of computers connected to the server that will run the application using our product  or for certain applications  are based on the number of users 
pricing of versant object database and fastobjects licenses varies according to several factors  including the number of computer servers on which the application runs and the number of users that are able to access the server at any one time 
customers may elect to simultaneously purchase development and deployment licenses for an entire project 
these development and deployment licenses may also provide for prepayment to us of a nonrefundable amount for future deployment 
vars and distributors purchase development licenses from us on a per seat basis on terms similar to those of development licenses that we sell directly to end users 
vars are authorized to sublicense deployment copies of our data management products that are either bundled or embedded in the var s applications and sold directly to end users 
vars are required to report their distribution of our software and are charged a royalty that is either based on the number of copies of the application software that are distributed or computed as a percentage of the selling price charged by the vars to their end user customers 
these royalties from vars may be prepaid in full or paid upon deployment 
provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met  revenues from arrangements with vars are recognized  i as to prepaid license arrangements  when the prepaid licenses are sold to the var  and ii as to other license arrangements  at the time the var provides a royalty report to us for sales made by the var during a given period 
revenues from our resale of third party products or services are recorded at total contract value with the corresponding cost included in the cost of sales when we act as a principal in these transactions by assuming the risks and rewards of ownership including the risk of loss for collection  delivery or returns 
when we do not assume the risks and rewards of ownership  revenues from the resale of third party products or services are recorded at contract value net of the cost of sales 
on occasion  at a customer s request  we perform engineering work to port our products to an unsupported platform  to customize our software for specific functionality  or to perform other non routine technical assignments for a customer 
in these instances  we recognize revenues in accordance with asc  construction type and production type contracts  and use either the time and material percentage of completion method or the completed contract method for recognizing revenues 
we use the percentage of completion method if we can make reasonable and dependable estimates of labor costs and hours required to complete the work in question 
we periodically review these estimates in connection with the work performed and rates actually charged and recognize any losses when identified 
progress to completion is determined using the cost to cost method  whereby cost incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated cost determines the percentage completed and revenue recognized 
when using the percentage of completion method  the following conditions must exist an agreement must include provisions that clearly specify the rights regarding goods or services to be provided and received by both parties  the consideration to be exchanged and the manner and terms of settlement 
the customer is able to satisfy its obligations under the contract 
versant is able to satisfy its obligations under the contract 

table of contents the completed contract method is used when reasonable or dependable estimates of labor costs and time to complete the work cannot be made 
as a result  in such situations  we defer all revenues until such time as the work is fully completed 
management makes significant judgments and estimates in connection with the determination of the revenue we recognize in each accounting period 
if we had made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized would have resulted 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets we account for purchases of acquired companies in accordance with asc  business combinations  and allocate the cost of the acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired according to their respective fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisition  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology  are amortized to expense over time  while in process research and development costs  or ipr d  if any  are charged to operations expenditures at the time of acquisition 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we test for any goodwill impairment within our single data management operating segment and reporting unit 
all our goodwill reflected in the financial statements included in this report has been aggregated from  and acquired in connection with  the following acquisitions versant europe  acquired in  poet holdings  inc  acquired in march  technology of jdo genie pty ltd  acquired in june  fastobjects  inc  acquired in july  and dbo  acquired in december financial accounting standards board fasb guidance requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events 
we use the market approach to assess the fair value of our assets and this value is compared with the carrying value of those assets to test for impairment 
the total fair value of our assets is estimated by summing the fair value of our equity as indicated by versant s publicly traded share price and shares outstanding plus an estimated control premium less our liabilities 
under this approach  if the estimated fair value of our assets is greater than their carrying value  then there is no goodwill impairment 
if the estimated fair value of our assets is less than their carrying value  then we allocate the reporting unit s estimated fair value to its assets and liabilities as though the reporting unit had just been acquired in a business combination 
the impairment loss is the amount  if any  by which the implied fair value of goodwill allocable to the reporting unit is less than that reporting unit s goodwill carrying amount and would be recorded in operating results during the period of such impairment 
identifiable intangibles are currently amortized using the straight line method over five years in relation to the jdo genie pty ltd acquisition  six years in relation to the fastobjects  inc acquisition  seven years in relation to our acquisition of poet  nine years in relation to the acquisition of the dbo customer relationships  and five years for other dbo related acquired intangible assets 
we performed our annual valuation and analysis of goodwill in october  october and october we did not perform impairment tests related to our intangible assets during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  as there were no triggering events which might indicate impairment 
as a result  we determined that the value of our goodwill and intangible assets had been fairly recorded in 
table of contents our financial statements  and therefore no impairment charges were recorded against our goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method provided by asc  income taxes 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and account for income taxes payable as part of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and amortization  for financial and tax reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet to the extent deemed realizable 
we assess the likelihood that  and the extent to which  our deferred tax assets will be realized and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not 
if we establish or release a valuation allowance  or increase or decrease it in a given period  then we must increase or decrease the tax provision in our statements of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
based upon our operating results in recent years and through october  as well as an assessment of our expected future results of operations  we determined that it had become more likely than not that we would realize a portion of our net deferred tax assets in germany 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  we released  of our valuation allowance 
due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the balance of our deferred tax assets  we have maintained a valuation allowance at october  of million 
as of october   we had established a full valuation allowance of million for our deferred tax assets 
as required by asc  income taxes  we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
we are subject to us federal income taxes and to income taxes in various states in the us as well as in foreign jurisdictions 
tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us federal  state and local  or foreign tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes for all periods presented  which were not significant

fluctuations in our total revenues can be attributed to changes in economic and industry conditions  product and customer mix  general trends in information technology spending  changes in geographic mix  and the corresponding impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
further  product life cycles impact revenues periodically as old contracts expire and new products are released 
our revenues as shown in the above table and in the accompanying statements of income included in this report do not include revenues from our disposed websphere consulting practice 
instead  as required by generally accepted accounting principles  our financial statements report former websphere activities as net income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for more information regarding this transaction 
our total revenues decreased by million or in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease of million or in license revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in total revenues also included approximately million resulting from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations comprising of the million decrease in total revenues 
we believe factors that caused our license revenues to decrease in fiscal included the adverse global economic conditions  the relative absence of larger license transactions  fewer license transactions and the stronger us dollar as compared to the euro in fiscal  which resulted in lower consolidated revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal maintenance revenues remained relatively stable in fiscal over fiscal  decreasing by  or 
our total revenues increased by million or in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase resulted primarily from a increase in license revenues and a increase in maintenance revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal  and included approximately million of revenues comprising of the million increase in total revenues resulting from favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we believe factors that caused our license revenues to increase in fiscal over fiscal included continuing increased maturity and focus of our sales organization  increased acceptance and success of our var customers applications with end users  the overall reputation and acceptance of our products in the vertical markets we serve including telecommunications and defense  and the strong euro as compared to the us dollar in fiscal  which resulted in higher consolidated revenues in fiscal maintenance revenues increased in fiscal over fiscal primarily as a result of the increased license revenues in the same period 
no one customer accounted for or more of our total revenues in fiscal and fiscal and for the quarters ended october  and october  one customer accounted for of our total revenues for fiscal and one customer accounted for of our total revenues for the quarter ended october  the inherently unpredictable business cycle of an enterprise software company makes discernment of continued and meaningful business trends difficult 
in terms of license revenues  we are still experiencing lengthy sales cycles and customers preference for licensing our software on an as needed basis  versus the historical practice of prepaying license fees in advance of usage  a factor 
table of contents which can adversely affect the amount of our license revenues 
license revenues also are a critical factor in driving the amount of our services revenues  as new license customers typically enter into support and maintenance agreements with us  from which our maintenance revenues are derived over future fiscal periods 
the outlook into the company s anticipated performance in fiscal is much more uncertain than in prior years  due principally to the significant worldwide recession 
we are currently expecting our total revenues for fiscal to be at a similar level as in fiscal therefore  for fiscal year we currently forecast total revenues of between million and million

license revenues were million or of total revenues for fiscal  a decrease of approximately million or from million or of total revenues reported for fiscal the reduced license revenues for fiscal were mainly attributable to fewer larger license transactions and included unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of approximately  comprising of the million decrease in license revenues 
during fiscal year we derived approximately million of revenues from several significant license transactions with four telecommunications customers  whereas we did not have comparable license transactions of this scale during fiscal year the majority of our license revenues in fiscal continued to be transactions with existing var customers in the telecommunications industry  which was our largest vertical market in fiscal maintenance revenues maintenance and technical support revenues include revenues derived from maintenance agreements  under which we provide customers with internet and telephone access to support personnel and software upgrades  dedicated technical assistance and emergency response support options

since the company s acquisition of poet holdings  inc in early  we have generally derived a higher percentage of international revenues due to stronger demand for our products in europe 
we expect in the future to continue to experience a somewhat stronger demand for our products in europe as compared to our other geographic markets 
revenues from asia we also experienced a decrease of million or in revenues from our asia pacific region during fiscal  primarily due to three significant license transactions totaling approximately million with two asia pacific telecommunications customers in fiscal  while there were no such comparable transactions in fiscal a variety of factors may impact versant s future revenues  including the potential strengthening of the us dollar which would have the effect of reducing portions of our revenue resulting from favorable currency exchange fluctuations and the generally more difficult economic environment
