overview the princeton review is a leading provider of classroom based and online education products and services targeting the high school and post secondary markets 
the company was founded in to provide sat preparation courses 
today  based on our experience in the test preparation industry  we now believe that we are among the leading providers of test preparation courses for most major post secondary and graduate admissions tests 
on december   we acquired penn foster education group penn foster  one of the oldest and largest online education companies in the united states  for an aggregate purchase price in cash of million plus an estimated working capital payment of approximately million 
to finance the acquisition  we i borrowed million through a term loan under a credit agreement entered into with general electric capital corporation ii borrowed million under a senior subordinated note purchase agreement entered into with sankaty credit opportunities iv  lp sankaty and falcon mezzanine partners ii and certain of its affiliates falcon  iii borrowed million in junior subordinated debt under a securities purchase 
table of contents agreement entered into with sankaty and falcon  iv borrowed million under a bridge note purchase agreement entered into with sankaty  and v issued an aggregate of  shares of series e non convertible preferred stock series e preferred stock with a stated value of  per share  including  shares of series e preferred stock in exchange for all outstanding series c convertible preferred stock 
we believe that the acquisition of penn foster provides us with the following benefits immediate scale in online education 
with over  online students  penn foster provides us with instant scale  credibility and expertise in online education 
the department of education estimates that of united states workers will need to be re trained in the next several years  and the obama administration has committed substantial funding for job training programs 
penn foster s expertise in online career education affords us the ability to pursue these market opportunities 
penn foster s expertise also provides us with substantial technological capabilities  marketing leverage and online customer acquisition experience as we continue to augment the traditional classroom based model of our test preparation services division with new online initiatives 
compelling student value proposition 
penn foster provides a range of accredited degree  diploma and certificate programs in high growth  high demand career fields on an affordable and easily accessible basis 
students can acquire a quality education with flexible start dates and self paced online study at a price that is lower than tuition fees charged by most of our competitors 
increased ability to grow through partnerships 
penn foster enhances our ability to increase revenues through partnerships with educational institutions including not for profit institutions  professional and trade organizations and others 
for example  we recently announced plans to form an online post secondary education venture with the national labor college  the afl cio s accredited higher education institution  to provide high quality  affordable online courses to the afl cio s million union members and their families 
in addition  we believe that there are significant opportunities to leverage the brand and reputation of the princeton review in secondary education to attract new students to penn foster high school 
enhanced revenue diversification and visibility 
we believe that the acquisition of penn foster enhances the diversification and visibility of our revenues 
penn foster s focus on the post secondary education market complements our established presence in secondary education and our post secondary and graduate school test products 
in addition  the year round enrollments for penn foster s post secondary students increase the revenue visibility of our business and help offset the seasonality in our test preparation business 
we currently operate through our test preparation services  penn foster and supplemental educational services ses divisions 
test preparation services division the test preparation services division derives the majority of its revenue from classroom based and princeton review online test preparation courses and tutoring services 
this division also receives royalties from its independent franchisees  which provide classroom based courses under the princeton review brand 
as a result of the acquisition of test services  inc tsi in march  the princeton review franchises in several southern california locations  utah and new mexico socal in july and the princeton review pittsburgh  inc in october  we do not have any remaining domestic franchisees as of december  additionally  this division receives royalties and advances from random house for books authored by the princeton review 
the test preparation services division accounted for of our overall revenue in the year ended december   and historically has accounted for the majority of our overall revenue 
as a result of the acquisition of penn foster  we expect test preparation services revenue to constitute between and of our total revenue 

table of contents supplemental educational services division the supplemental educational services ses division provides state aligned research based academic tutoring instruction to students in schools in need of improvement in school districts throughout the country which receive funding under the no child left behind act of nclb 
in the fourth quarter of we experienced greater variability in school districts willingness to fully utilize funds allocated to ses programs  as well as generally later program start dates and greater competition from individual school districts that developed and offered internally developed ses programs 
in addition  there is increased uncertainty about the future of nclb and the concept of adequate yearly performance as a means of allocating title i funding 
we currently believe that while revenues will decline in  we can continue to operate this business at approximately break even in the current climate  but we are carefully monitoring developments in the ses regulatory framework  and we will continue to evaluate the extent of our participation in this business 
penn foster division the penn foster division offers academic programs through three primary educational institutions penn foster career school  penn foster college and penn foster high school 
each institution offers students flexibility in scheduling the start date of enrollment  scheduling lessons and completing coursework 
all course materials and supplies are mailed to students and are available online except third party textbooks 
students are given access to a homepage from which they can access online study guides  view financial and academic records  access the penn foster library and librarian  view messages sent by the school  view grade history and access online blogs  chat groups  discussion boards and career services 
penn foster uses the services of over faculty members who provide on demand support for all course offerings via email  message boards  webinars and telephone 
discontinued businesses the company s former k services division provided a number of services to k schools and school districts  including assessment  professional development and intervention materials workbooks and related products 
additionally  this division received college counseling fees paid by high schools 
in september  the company committed to a plan to dispose of the k services division 
accordingly  the k services division is presented as a discontinued operation in this form k 
in december  the company signed a definitive agreement to sell the k assets to core education and consulting solutions  inc core  a subsidiary of core projects and technologies limited  an education technology company 
as a result of the company s commitment to dispose of the division and the core sale agreement  a million impairment charge was recognized in to reduce the carrying value of the assets of the k business to their estimated fair value  less costs to dispose 
on march   the company completed its sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the k services division to core 
the aggregate consideration for the sale consisted of i million in cash paid on the closing date and ii additional cash consideration of million  which represented the net working capital of the k services division as of the closing date  which was finalized and paid on october  as a result of this sale  a million gain was recognized in until february  the company s former admissions services division derived most of its revenue from the sale of web based admissions and related application management products to educational institutions higher education technology services 
in february  we sold our web based admissions and application management business for million in cash and a potential earn out of up to million 
in connection with the sale of the higher education technology services business  financial results associated with this business were reclassified as discontinued operations 
in connection with this transaction  two other businesses operated by this division college counseling and admissions publications were transferred to the k services now classified as discontinued operations and test preparation services divisions  respectively 
the only remaining business operated by the former admissions services division was providing higher education marketing 
table of contents services to post secondary schools

under this new arrangement  the sales and customer support functions related to this business are to be performed by higher edge and we are responsible solely for the fulfillment function 
accordingly  all of the remaining employees in this division were transferred to other divisions  or terminated and re hired by higher edge 
higher edge contracts with post secondary schools directly and is required to pay us a royalty on the fees it receives from post secondary schools for marketing services

this increase in revenue is partially offset by a million reduction in franchise fees as a direct result of the same franchise acquisitions and a  reduction in non franchise licensing revenue due to the termination of a contract with a marketing partner that filed for bankruptcy 
the increase is further offset by a decrease of million due primarily to lower classroom based and tutoring revenues during the year ended december  
table of contents increases in classroom based enrollments were offset by lower prices charged for our classroom based courses and a higher percentage of enrollments from lower priced services 
organic tutoring revenues declined due to lower enrollments and a shift towards lower priced tutoring packages 
we expect these pricing and enrollment trends to continue through ses revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in revenue from regions we operated in for all of declined by million due to declining enrollments and contract delays during the first half of the school year due to the reduction in school district allocation of funds to ses programs and greater competition from individual school districts that have developed and offered internally developed ses programs

ses cost of goods and services sold increased by  or  to million in from million in despite the reduction in revenue for the year  the increase in costs of goods and services sold was primarily due to the additional operating regions in the school year that were not included in the results for the year ended december  gross margin during the period for the ses services division decreased from to due primarily to lower gross margins in new operating regions as average students per class in new regions were lower than existing regions as of the year ended december   as well the negative impact of lower revenues in existing regions

table of contents ses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to lower compensation expense and cost reductions as a result of the decline in revenue 
penn foster selling  general and administrative expenses of million primarily represent advertising  promotional  marketing and administrative costs for the period from december  through december  corporate expenses decreased million or  to million in from million in primarily due to reductions in corporate headcount as a result of our restructuring initiatives and reduced incentive compensation expense 
this decrease is partially offset by increased professional service fees attributed to our outsourced information technology function 
refer to our discussion on restructuring charges below 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million from million in the increase is primarily the result of million of new depreciation and amortization on the fixed and intangible assets acquired with penn foster on december  coupled with a full year of depreciation and amortization on the acquired fixed and intangible assets of the tsi  socal and pittsburgh franchises which were acquired in march  july and october  respectively 
due to the acquisition of penn foster and ongoing technology investments  we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase by approximately million in restructuring for the year ended december   restructuring charges were million as compared to million in the increase is attributed to two restructuring initiatives that were commenced during the year 
in the first quarter of  we announced and commenced an initiative to outsource our information technology operations  transfer the majority of remaining corporate functions located in new york city to offices located near boston  massachusetts  and simplify our management structure following the sale of the k services division 
this initiative resulted in million of restructuring charges  primarily related to employee severance and termination benefits and external transition fees and duplicative costs associated with the transition of information technology operations to a third party 
substantially all cash payments associated with this initiative were made by the end of following our acquisition of penn foster on december   we announced and commenced a restructuring initiative in the fourth quarter of that involves the consolidation of our real estate portfolio and certain operations  the reorganization of our management structure and the elimination of certain duplicative assets and functions 
in conjunction with this initiative  certain senior management roles were eliminated and on december   we notified certain employees of our intention to close our administrative office in new york city by march  we incurred restructuring charges of million for this initiative related to employee severance and termination benefits 
we expect to make all cash payments associated with these charges by the end of the fourth quarter of in addition  we expect to incur additional restructuring charges in related to lease termination costs associated with the new york city facility closure and the elimination of additional duplicative assets and functions as we further integrate penn foster and our existing business structure 
restructuring charges for the year ended december  related to an initiative that was announced and commenced in the third quarter of  continuing through the third quarter of  related to the relocation of our finance and some legal operations from new york city to offices located near boston  massachusetts  and the consolidation of the remaining new york offices

substantially all cash payments associated with this initiative were made by the end of the third quarter of acquisition expenses acquisition expenses for the year ended december  of million consist of advisory  legal  document filing and accounting fees associated with the acquisition of penn foster

interest expense from the financings undertaken to fund the penn foster acquisition totaled million for the period from the december  acquisition to december  we expect total interest expense for to be approximately million as a result of the acquisition financing 
interest income interest income decreased by  or  to  in from  in due primarily to higher average cash balances during the year ended december  other income expense  net other income expense  net for the year ended december  includes a charge of  related to a prepayment premium fee and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the retirement and cancelation of the wells fargo credit facility on december  this charge was offset in part by  of income recognized from the change in fair value of our embedded derivatives and  of income recognized from additional proceeds received from the sale of stock in a private investment that occurred in september other income expense  net for the year ended december  was not significant

we will continue to record such allowances until we have established a reasonable history of generating pre tax income coupled with an expectation of generating future pre tax profits which substantiate an ability to recover net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  any tax benefit or provision we have recorded in or relates primarily to deferred taxes due to the temporary difference related to tax deductible amortization of goodwill which cannot be expected to reverse in the foreseeable future  taxes on income related to our canadian operations  withholding tax on income from foreign franchisees  and state taxes 
for the year ended december   the provision for income taxes decreased by  to  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is mainly a result of the utilization of losses generated by continuing operations to offset income from discontinued operations 
the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate of due to our inability to record a tax benefit on our losses generated in the united states  differences in foreign tax rates  and the effect of tax deductible goodwill  for which a deferred tax liability has been recorded

liquidity and capital resources overview our primary sources of liquidity during the year ended december  were the net proceeds from financings related to our acquisition of penn foster  cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash flow generated from operations  cash proceeds from the sale of our k services division a discontinued operation and borrowings under our former revolving credit facility 
our primary uses of cash during the year ended december  were the penn foster acquisition  capital expenditures and repayments of borrowings under our former revolving and term loan credit facility 
at december  we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of unused borrowing capacity available under our new credit agreement 
in addition  in september we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec utilizing a shelf registration process whereby we may from time to time offer and sell common stock  preferred stock  warrants or units  or any combination of these securities  in one or more offerings up to a total amount of million 
on december   we acquired penn foster for an aggregate purchase price in cash of million plus an estimated working capital payment of approximately million 
to finance the acquisition  we i borrowed million through a term loan under a credit agreement entered into with general electric

the terms of these financings are described in greater detail following our discussion of operating  investing and financing activities below 
we expect our principal sources of funding for operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt service obligations during to be our current cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations  borrowings under our new credit facility and million of proceeds from additional series e preferred stock issued in march our new debt financing agreements contain covenants that limit  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness and that require us to comply with financial covenant ratios that are dependent on maintaining certain operating performance levels on an ongoing basis 
specifically  our financial maintenance covenants include maximum ratios of total debt as defined to adjusted ebitda as defined  that decrease with the passage of time  and minimum ratios of adjusted cash flows as defined to fixed charges as defined  that increase with the passage of time 
in addition  the covenants limit our annual capital expenditures 
we were in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements as of december  our ability to generate sufficient operating income and positive cash flows from operations to maintain compliance under our debt agreements is dependent on our future financial performance  which is subject to many factors beyond our control as outlined in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
in addition to generating positive income from operations  the timing of cash payments received under our customer arrangements is a primary factor impacting our sources of liquidity 
our test preparation services division generates the largest portion of our cash flow from operations from its retail classroom and tutoring courses 
these customers usually pay us in advance or contemporaneously with the services we provide  thereby supporting our short term liquidity needs 
increasingly  however  across test preparation services and ses  we are generating a greater percentage of our cash from contracts with institutions such as schools and school districts and post secondary institutions all of which pay us in arrears 
typical payment performance for these institutional customers  once invoiced  ranges from to days 
additionally  the long contract approval cycles and or delays in purchase order generation with some of our contracts with large institutions or school districts can contribute to the level of variability in the timing of our cash receipts 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december  were million as compared to cash used for operating activities of million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to a decrease in fourth quarter cash expenditures relating to our declining ses business as compared to the quarter ended december   an increase in payables attributed to our expanding system upgrades  and improved collections in fourth quarter accounts receivable  as compared to the quarter ended december  cash flows used for operating activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the reduction in cash flows used for operating activities in was primarily the result of positive operating income in of million as compared to a million operating loss in the cash flow benefits from revenue growth and cost reductions in were offset by million of restructuring payments and  to a lesser extent  growth in ses revenue which did not convert to cash in

this issue is effective for the company s revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january  the company will evaluate the impact of this issue on the company s financial statements when reviewing its new or materially modified revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables once this issue becomes effective 
in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification the codification 
the codification became the single source for all authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied for financial statements issued for periods ending after september  the codification does not change gaap and did not have an effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in april  the fasb issued a standard that amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the standard became effective as of january  and the company applied the provisions in connection with the acquisition of penn foster 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
in march  the fasb issued an accounting standard that requires entities that utilize derivative instruments to provide qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using such instruments  as well as any details of credit risk related contingent features contained within derivatives 
the standard also requires entities to disclose additional information about the amounts and location of derivatives located within the financial statements and the impact that hedges have on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
the standard became effective for the company beginning january  and did not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
in september  an accounting standard was established for fair value measurements 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  expands disclosures about fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements 
the standard requires quantitative disclosures about fair value measurements for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non recurring basis during a period 
in february  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that deferred the effective date of this standard to january  for all non financial assets and liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements on a recurring basis that is  at least annually 
the standard remained effective on january  for financial assets and liabilities

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as related disclosures 
we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to the collectability of our accounts receivable balances  which impacts bad debt write offs  recoverability of goodwill  which impacts goodwill impairment expense  assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts operating expense when we record the impairment of assets or accelerate their depreciation  recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impacts our tax provision  revenue recognition requirements  which impacts how and when we recognize revenue from our goods and services and the estimates we use to record stock based compensation expense 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies 
however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
for a discussion of our other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances for uncollectible accounts may be required 
we review our receivables on a regular basis to determine if past due balances are likely to be collected 
this review includes discussions with our customers and their account representatives  the customers payment history and other factors 
based on these reviews we may increase or decrease our allowance for uncollectible accounts if we determine there is a change in the collectability of our accounts receivable 
goodwill impairment we perform our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we completed our annual impairment testing related to goodwill and determined that these assets were not impaired during  and we use valuation techniques to estimate fair value which rely primarily on our historical and projected operating results and market information related to public companies we deem to have operations comparable to us 
projected operating results are consistent with estimates used in our budgeting and planning processes 
changes in our projected operating results or market information used in this analysis would affect our fair value estimates 
impairment of long lived assets subject to depreciation and amortization we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in 
table of contents our use of the assets 
we assess recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the related total projected undiscounted net cash flows 
if an asset grouping s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
we also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based upon management s best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition 
we record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss 
income taxes companies are required to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we assess the likelihood that we will realize our deferred tax assets and if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset net of deferred tax liabilities that are scheduled to reverse in the foreseeable future as we believe it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and deferred taxes will not be realized 
if  in the future  an appropriate level and consistency of profitability is attained  we would reduce the valuation allowance  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we are required to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective primarily for institutional contracts that require us to provide more than one product or service and accordingly record revenue in accordance with an accounting standard that provides guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accounting for multiple element arrangements  we must estimate the accounting value attributable to the different contractual elements and determine the timing for recognition of each element 
revenue is allocated to each element based on our assessment of the relative fair value of that element to the aggregate fair value of all elements 
the fair values must be reliable  verifiable and objectively determinable 
when available  such determination is based principally on the pricing of similar arrangements with unrelated parties that are not part of a multiple element arrangement 
in addition  in our penn foster division we record revenue from sales to individual students as exams are completed at the expected rate per exam based on the division s historical experience over a large homogenous population 
restructuring our facilities related expenses and liabilities under all of our restructuring plans included estimates of the remaining rental obligations  net of estimated sublease income  for facilities we no longer occupy 
we review our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis until the outcome is finalized and make whatever modifications we believe necessary  based on our best judgment  to reflect any changed circumstances 
it is possible that such estimates could change in the future resulting in additional adjustments  and the effect of any such adjustments could be material 

table of contents stock based compensation we record stock based compensation in accordance with an accounting standard that requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all shared based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units 
the standard requires companies to recognize stock based compensation awards granted to employees as compensation expense on a fair value method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of the standard  stock based compensation cost is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
the expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited 
the fair value of a stock option is determined using a black scholes option pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date  the exercise price  the expected life of the option  the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends  and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option 
these assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence compensation expense 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our historical operations 
seasonality in results of operations we experience  and we expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in our revenue  results of operations and cash flows because the markets in which we operate are subject to seasonal fluctuations based on the scheduled dates for standardized admissions tests and the typical school year 
these fluctuations could result in volatility or adversely affect our stock price 
we typically generate the largest portion of our test preparation revenue in the third quarter 
ses revenue is concentrated in the first and fourth quarters to more closely reflect the after school programs greatest activity during the school year 
we expect that penn foster results will be less prone to seasonal fluctuations and will provide a steady stream of revenue  operating results and cash flows throughout the year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of the outstanding debt under our senior credit facilities  which bear interest  at the company s option  at either libor or a defined base rate plus an applicable margin 
at december   our total outstanding term loan balance under the senior credit facilities exposed to variable interest rates was million 
a increase in the interest rate on this balance would increase annual interest expense by  we do not carry any other variable interest rate debt 
revenue from our international operations and royalty payments from our international franchisees constitute an insignificant percentage of our total revenue 
accordingly  our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations is minimal
