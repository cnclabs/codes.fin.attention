table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto  as well as the business and risk factors sections of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading provider of specialty contracting services 
these services are provided throughout the united states and include engineering  construction  maintenance and installation services to telecommunications providers  underground facility locating services to various utilities including telecommunications providers  and other construction and maintenance services to electric and gas utilities and others 
additionally  we provide services on a limited basis in canada 
for the fiscal year ended july   the percentage of our revenue by customer type from telecommunications  underground facility locating  and electric and gas utilities and other customers  was approximately   and  respectively 
we conduct operations through our subsidiaries 
our revenues may fluctuate as a result of changes in the capital expenditure and maintenance budgets of our customers  changes in the general level of construction activity  as well as overall economic conditions 
the capital expenditures and maintenance budgets of our telecommunications customers may be impacted by consumer demands on telecommunications providers  the introduction of new communication technologies  the physical maintenance needs of their infrastructure  the actions of our government and the federal communications commission  and general economic conditions 
a significant portion of our services are performed under master service agreements and other arrangements with customers that extend for periods of one or more years 
we are currently a party to over of these agreements 
master service agreements generally contain customer specified service requirements  such as discrete pricing for individual tasks 
to the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity  there are often a number of exceptions  including the ability of the customer to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers  perform work with the customer s own employees  and use other service providers when jointly placing facilities with another utility 
in most cases  a customer may terminate these agreements for convenience with written notice 
the remainder of our services are provided pursuant to contracts for specific projects 
long term contracts relate to specific projects with terms in excess of one year from the contract date 
short term contracts for specific projects are generally of three to four months in duration 
a portion of our contracts include retainage provisions under which to of the contract invoicing may be withheld by the customer pending project completion 
we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures 
a significant majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
revenues from contracts using the cost to cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
revenues from services provided under time and materials based contracts are recognized as the services are performed 
the following table summarizes our revenues from multi year master service agreements and other long term contracts  as a percentage of contract revenues from continuing operations fiscal year ended multi year master service agreements other long term contracts total long term contracts the percentage of revenue from long term contracts varies between periods depending on the mix of volume of work performed under our contracts 
during fiscal  revenue from total long term contracts increased compared to the prior year as more work was performed for contracts with original terms greater than one year 
revenue during fiscal included revenue for services performed under short term contracts related to the hurricanes that impacted the southern united states during september and winter storms during the third quarter of fiscal 
table of contents a significant portion of our revenue comes from several large customers 
the following table reflects the percentage of total revenue from those customers who contributed at least of our total revenue from continuing operations in fiscal  or fiscal year ended at t inc comcast corporation verizon communications inc centurylink time warner cable inc charter communications  inc windstream corporation qwest communications international inc for comparison purposes  centurylink  inc and embarq corporation revenues have been combined for periods prior to their july merger 
cost of earned revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts  including costs for direct labor provided by employees  services by subcontractors  operation of capital equipment excluding depreciation and amortization  direct material and insurance claims and other related costs 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
locate damage claims result from property and other damages arising in connection with our underground facility locating services 
a change in claims experience or actuarial assumptions related to these risks could materially affect our results of operations 
for a majority of the contract services we per form  our customers provide all necessary materials and we provide the personnel  tools  and equipment necessary to perform installation and maintenance services 
materials supplied by our customers  for which the customer retains financial and performance risk  are not included in our revenue or costs of sales 
in addition  cost of earned revenues for the fiscal years and includes a million charge and a million charge  respectively  related to the settlement of legal matters 
general and administrative costs include all of our corporate costs  as well as costs of our subsidiaries management personnel and administrative overhead 
these costs primarily consist of employee compensation and related expenses  including stock based compensation  legal  consulting and professional fees  information technology and development costs  provision for or recoveries of bad debt expense  and other costs that are not directly related to performance of our services under customer contracts 
our senior management  including the senior managers of our subsidiaries  perform substantially all of our sales and marketing functions as part of their management responsibilities and  accordingly  we have not incurred material sales and marketing expenses 
information technology and development costs included in general and administrative expenses are primarily incurred to support and to enhance our operating efficiency 
to protect our rights  we have filed for patents on certain of our innovations 
in december  the united states patent and trademark office granted our first patent as a result of these efforts 
we are subject to concentrations of credit risk relating primarily to our cash and equivalents  trade accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
cash and equivalents primarily include balances on deposit in banks 
we maintain substantially all of our cash and equivalents at financial institutions we believe to be of high credit quality 
to date we have not experienced any loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts 
we grant credit under normal payment terms  generally without collateral  to our customers 
these customers primarily consist of telephone companies  cable television multiple system operators  electric and gas utilities 
with respect to a portion of the services provided to these customers  we have certain statutory lien rights which may in certain circumstances enhance our collection efforts 
adverse changes in overall business and economic factors may impact our customers and increase potential credit risks 
these risks may be heightened as a result of the current economic climate and market volatility 
in the past  some of our customers have experienced significant financial difficulties and likewise  some may experience financial difficulties in the future 
these difficulties expose us to increased risks rela ted to the collectability of amounts due for services performed 
we believe that none of our significant customers were experiencing financial difficulties that would impact the collectability of our trade accounts receivable and costs in excess of billings as of july  in june  a former employee of prince telecom  llc prince  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  commenced a lawsuit against prince  the company and certain unnamed us affiliates of prince and the company the affiliates in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the lawsuit alleges that prince  the company and the affiliates violated the fair labor standards act by failing to comply with applicable overtime pay requirements 
the plaintiff seeks unspecified damages and other relief on behalf of himself and a putative class of similarly situated current and former employees of prince  the company and or the affiliates 
it is too early to evaluate the likelihood of an outcome to this ma tter or estimate the amount or range of potential loss  if any 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against this lawsuit 
in may  the company and prince were named as defendants in a lawsuit in the us district court for the western district of washington 
the plaintiffs  all former employees of the subsidiary  alleged various wage and hour claims  including that employees were not paid for all hours worked and were subject to improper wage deductions 
plaintiffs sought to certify as a class current and former employees of the subsidiary who worked in the state of washington 
in november  the plaintiffs attorneys  the company and the subsidiary entered into a memorandum of understanding pursuant to which the parties agreed to the terms of a proposed settlement with respect to the lawsuit 
in january  the court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement 
notice of the terms of the proposed settlement and claim forms were mailed to members of the plaintiffs class in february the court held a hearing regarding the plaintiffs motion for final approval of the class action settlement in april  at which time it entered an order approving the settlement and dismissed the action with prejudice subject to final administration of the terms of the settlement 
excluding our legal expenses  approximately million was incurred pursuant to the settlement and was paid in june 
table of contents during fiscal  we were contacted by counsel representing current and former employees alleging violations of the fair labor standards act and state wage and hour laws at our utiliquest  llc  sts  llc and locating  inc subsidiaries 
the claims included periods dating primarily from september through january  and covered a number of states where these subsidiaries conducted business 
during fiscal  these subsidiaries reached an agreement to settle these claims through a structured mediation process 
excluding legal expenses  approximately million was incurred pursuant to the settlement in fiscal and was paid in october in december  two former employees of apex digital  llc apex  a wholly owned subsidiary that was previously discontinued  commenced a lawsuit against the subsidiary in illinois state court on behalf of themselves and purporting to represent other similarly situated employees in illinois 
the lawsuit alleged that apex violated certain minimum wage laws under the fair labor standards act and related state laws by failing to comply with applicable minimum wage and overtime pay requirements 
in fiscal  the subsidiary reached an agreement to settle these claims through a structured mediation process and incurred a charge of approximately million for the settlement and was paid in january from time to time  we and our subsidiaries are parties to various other claims and legal proceedings 
additionally  as part of our insurance program  we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
for these claims  the effect on our financial statements is generally limited to the amount needed to satisfy our insurance deductibles or retentions 
it is the opinion of our management  based on information available at this time  that none of such other pending claims or proceedings will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire companies that expand  complement  or diversify our business 
we regularly review opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions 
our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to identify  acquire  and successfully integrate companies 
discontinued operations during fiscal  apex digital  llc apex  a wholly owned subsidiary  notified its primary customer of its intention to cease performing installation services in accordance with its contractual rights 
effective december  this customer  a satellite broadcast provider  transitioned its installation service requirements to others and apex ceased providing these services 
as a result  we have discontinued the operations of apex and presented its results separately in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
the cessation of these installation services has not had any material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
outlook the telecommunications industry has undergone and continues to undergo significant changes due to governmental deregulation  advances in technology  increased competition as the telephone and cable companies converge  and growing consumer demand for enhanced and bundled services 
as a result of these factors  the networks of our customers increasingly face demands for more capacity and greater reliability 
telecommunications providers continue to outsource a significant portion of their engineering  construction and maintenance requirements in order to reduce their investment in capital equipment  provide flexibility in workforce sizing  expand product offerings without large increases in incremental hiring and focus on those competencies they consider core to their business success 
these fac tors drive customer demand for our services 
telecommunications network operators are increasingly relying on the deployment of fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers in order to respond to demands for capacity  reliability  and product bundles of voice  video  and high speed data services 
fiber deployments have enabled an increasing number of cable companies to offer voice services in addition to their traditional video and data services 
these voice services require the installation of customer premise equipment and at times the upgrade of in home wiring 
additionally  fiber deployments are also facilitating the provisioning of video services by local telephone companies in addition to their traditional voice and high speed data services 
several large telephone companies have pursued fiber to the premise and fiber to the node initiatives to compete actively with cable operators 
these long term initiatives and the likelihood that other telephone companies pursue similar strategies present opportunities for us 
telecommunication companies have undertaken additional projects relating to the deployment of fiber optic cable to cell sites 
as wireless carriers have successfully marketed smart phones and other wireless data devices  the amount of cellular traffic that must be backhauled from cell sites to wired telecommunications networks has increased dramatically 
traditional copper based networks are incapable of cost effectively addressing the data traffic expected as wireless carriers begin to roll out advanced fourth generation wireless data services 
the increase in fiber backhaul services is expected to continue during fiscal  resulting in demand for the type of services we provide 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra originally allocated billion in funding to accelerate broadband deployment in rural areas of the country that have been without the high speed infrastructure 
to date  approximately billion has been awarded under the provisions of the arra  including awards to many of our current and former customers 
the projects funded by these awards are targeted for completion over the next several years 
we believe that broadband stimulus funding will create demand by many of our customers for the services we provide 

table of contents underground excavation is involved in a substantial portion of overall economic activity  including the construction and maintenance of telephone  cable television  power  water  sewer  and gas utility networks  the construction and maintenance of roads and highways as well as the construction of new and existing commercial and residential projects 
utility line locating is required prior to underground excavation 
we provide underground facility locating services to a variety of utility companies  including telecommunication providers 
the trend for outsourcing this requirement  along with the pace of overall economic activity influence the demand for underground facility locating services 
general economic conditions continue to be weak 
although recent indicators suggest a recovery in overall economic conditions  the strength and duration of this improvement and the impact that it will have on our customers remain uncertain 
the economic slowdown when combined with developments in the financial and credit markets  has created a challenging business environment for us and our customers 
we are closely monitoring the effects that changes in economic and market conditions may have on our customers and our business and we continue to manage those areas of the business we can control in response to these changes 
these areas include  b ut are not limited to  deploying appropriate workforce levels and supervisory employees  practicing sound safety procedures  managing fuel consumption levels and maintaining the investment in our fleet of vehicles and equipment to support current and future business opportunities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to recognition of revenue for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  the fair value of goodwill  the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long lived assets  income taxes  accrued insurance claims  asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization  allow ance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation expense for performance based stock awards  and accruals for contingencies  including legal matters 
these estimates and assumptions require the use of judgment as to the likelihood of various future outcomes and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations because they involve making significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the impact of these policies affect our reported and expected financial results and are discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussi on and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also important to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k contain additional information related to our accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies described herein  and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures 
a significant majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
revenues from contracts using the cost to cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
revenues from services provided under time and materials based contracts are recognized when the services are performed 
the current asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the current liability bil lings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals 
factors that we consider in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and their effects are recogn ized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued 
accrued insurance claims 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
locate damage claims result from property and other damages arising in connection with our underground facility locating services 
a liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is actuarially determined and reflected in the consolidated financial statements as accrued insurance claims 
as of july   the liability for accrued claims and related accrued processing costs was million compared to million at july  based on payment patterns of simi lar prior claims  we expect million of the amount accrued at july  to be paid within the next months 
we estimate the liability for claims based on facts  circumstances and historical evidence 
when loss reserves are recorded they are not discounted  even though they will not be paid until sometime in the future 
factors affecting the determination of the expected cost for existing and incurred but not reported claims include  but are not limited to  the frequency of future claims  the payment pattern of claims which have been incurred  changes in the medical condition of claimants  and other factors such as inflation  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations 
the decrease in accrued insurance claims at july  was primarily due to decreased operating levels and the timing of claims payments 

table of contents with regard to losses occurring in fiscal and fiscal  we have retained the risk of loss of up to million on a per occurrence basis for automobile liability  general liability and workers compensation 
these annual retention amounts are applicable to all of the states in which we operate  except with respect to workers compensation insurance in three states in which the company participates in a state sponsored insurance fund 
aggregate stop loss coverage for automobile liability  general liability and workers compensation claims is million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for losses under our employee health plan  we are party to a stop loss agreement under which we retain the risk of loss  on an annual basis  of the first  of claims per participant 
the stop loss agreement is subject to renewal from time to time  generally on an annual basis 
the current policy was in place during fiscal and expires on december  goodwill and intangible assets as of july   we had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of finite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
as of july   we had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of finite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
during fiscal  goodwill was reduced by approximately million for the impairment charge described below and also decreased by approximately million for the reversal of income tax liabilities no longer required 
there was no goodwill impairment during fiscal we account for goodwill in accordance with asc topic our reporting units and related indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value 
in addition  they are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value 
if we determine the fair value of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests  an impairment loss is recognized 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred 
in accordance with asc topic  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change which indicates that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability is determined based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
an impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
if we determine the fair value of an asset is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is incurred 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred 
we use judgment in assessing if goodwill and intangible assets are impaired 
estimates of fair value are based on our projection of revenues  operating costs  and cash flows taking into consideration historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
to measure fair value  we employ a combination of present value techniques which reflect market factors 
changes in our judgments and projections could result in significantly different estimates of fair value potentially resulting in additional impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets 
our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units 
the profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors resulting from the cyclical nature of our business  the high level of competition existing within our industry  the concentration of our revenues within a limited number of customers  and the level of overall economic activity 
during times of economic slowdown  our customers may reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects 
individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors than the company as a whole 
as a result  demand for the services of one or more of our reporting units could decline resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets 
we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets 
our estimate of the fair value of our reporting units was based on projections of revenues  operating costs  and cash flows taking into consideration historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions  as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies 
the key assumptions impacting the fair value of our reporting units during the fiscal annual impairment analysis were a expected cash flow for a period of seven years  b terminal value based on terminal growth rates of between and  and c a discount rate of which was based on our best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the reporting units 
the discount rate reflects risk inherent within each reporting unit operating individually  which is greater than the risk inherent in the company as a whole 
the discount rate used in the fiscal analysis decreased compared to the rate used in our fiscal interim analysis since the fiscal analysis reflected increased risk due to volatility in economic conditions as of january  we believe the assumptions used in the fiscal impairment analysis are consistent with the risks inherent in the business models of our reporting units and within our industry 
during the second quarter of fiscal  our market capitalization was significantly impacted by the extreme volatility in the us equity and credit markets and was below the book value of shareholders equity by a substantial margin 
as a result  we evaluated whether the decrease in our market capitalization reflected factors that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying value 
based on a combination of factors  including the economic environment  the sustained period of decline in our market capitalization  and the implied valuation and discount rate assumptions in our industry  we concluded there were sufficient indicators to perform an interim impairment test of the reporting units and related intangible assets as of january  as a result of this impairment test  we recognized a preliminary goodwill impairment charge of million during the second quarter of fiscal the fiscal second quarter charge included impairments at the following reporting units broadband installation services now broadband express for million  c for million  ervin for million  nichols for million  stevens for million and utiliquest for million 
the interim impairment analysis was finalized during the third quarter of fiscal and no further charges were incurred 
we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets 

table of contents the fiscal analysis used the same valuation techniques described for the fiscal annual analysis 
the key assumptions impacting the fair value of our reporting units during the fiscal interim impairment analysis were a expected cash flow for a period of seven years  b terminal value based on terminal growth rates of between and  and c a discount rate of which was based on our best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the reporting units 
the discount rate used in the fiscal analysis increased compared to the rate used in our fiscal annual analysis described below due to economic conditions and lower industry valuation comparisons 
this increase in the discount rate caused a substantial decline in the calcul ated estimate of fair value of the reporting units 
we believe the assumptions used in the fiscal interim impairment analysis were consistent with the risks inherent in the business models of our reporting units and within our industry 
as a result of our fiscal annual impairment analysis  we determined that the goodwill of our stevens reporting unit and nichols reporting unit were impaired and consequently recognized goodwill impairment charges of approximately and million  respectively  during the fourth quarter of fiscal the fiscal analysis used the same valuation techniques described for the fiscal annual and fiscal interim analysis 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units during the fiscal annual impairment analysis were a expected cash flow for a period of seven years  b terminal value based on terminal growth rates of between and  and c a discount rate of which was based on our best estimate during the period of the weighted average cost of capita l adjusted for risks associated with the reporting units 
the assumptions used in the fiscal annual impairment analysis were consistent with the risks inherent in the business models of our reporting units at the time the analysis was performed 
the fiscal impairment of stevens and nichols was primarily the result of a change in management s expectations of long term cash flows from customers of these reporting units 
as disclosed in our previous filings with the securities and exchange commission  each of these reporting units has a concentration of revenues from a limited number of customers 
changes in anticipated demand had an adverse impact on the expected future cash flows of the reporting units used in the annual impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal the reduction in demand is the result of customers allocating their capital spending away from work management anticipated would be performed by these reporting units 
in performing the asc topic impai rment assessment  management determined that this shift in demand was more than temporary  consequently impacting the expected cash flows over the seven year period used in our goodwill analysis 
for fiscal and  none of the reporting units incurred operating losses which would impact our overall financial position in a material manner 
current operating results  including any losses  are evaluated by us in the assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the estimates and assumptions used in assessing the fair value of the reporting units and the valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities are inherently subject to significant uncertainties 
changes in our judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in impairments of goodwill or intangible assets at additional reporting units 
for example  a change in the estimated discount rate used would have impacted the amount of the goodwill impairment char ges recorded during fiscal additionally  adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units 
we can provide no assurances that  if such conditions occur  they will not trigger additional impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods 
as of july   we believe the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset is recoverable  however  there can be no assurances that they will not be impaired in future periods 
certain of our reporting units also have other intangible assets including tradenames and customer relationship intangibles 
as of july   management believes that the carrying amounts of the intangible assets are recoverable 
however  if adverse events were to occur or circumstances were to change indicating that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable  the assets would be reviewed for impairment and the assets may become impaired 
stock based compensation 
our stock based award programs are intended to attract  retain and reward talented employees  officers and directors  and to align stockholder and employee interests 
we grant stock options  time based and performance based restricted share units to certain employees and officers 
the fair value of stock option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model based on certain assumptions 
the fair value of restricted share units is estimated on the date of grant and is generally equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant 
time vesting restricted share units vest ratably over a period of four years and are settled in one share of our common stock on the vesting date 
performance vesting restricted share units vest over a three year period from the date of grant  if certain performance goals are achieved 
in accordance with asc topic compensation stock compensation  compensation costs for performance based awards are recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance goal will be satisfied 
we use our best judgment to determine the probability of achieving the performance goals at each reporting period and recognize compensation costs based on our estimate of the shares that are expected to vest 

table of contents income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
in june  the fasb issued asc topic  income taxes asc topic formerly fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

asc topic prescribes a two step process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income ta x positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
the first step evaluates an income tax position in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step measures the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements for those income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold 
asc topic also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  recognition and classification of interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
in may  the fasb issued an amendment of asc topic to provide guidance that a company may recognize a previously unrecognized tax benefit if the tax position is effectively as opposed to ultimately settled through examination  negotiation  or litigation 
we adopted the provisions of asc topic on july   the first day of fiscal allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management analyzes the collectability of accounts receivable balances on a regular basis 
this analysis considers the aging of account balances  historical bad debt experience  changes in customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  customer payment activity and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimate made by management may also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
we recognize an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that a receivable is not collecta ble and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
any increase in the allowance account has a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations 
we believe that none of our significant customers are experiencing significant financial difficulty as of july  that will materially affect our accounts receivable or allowance for doubtful accounts 
contingencies and litigation 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are involved in certain legal proceedings 
asc topic  contingencies asc topic requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued  we evaluate  among other factors  the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
if only a range of probable loss can be determined  we accrue within the range for the contingency based on our best estimate 
in those cases where none of the estimates within the range is better than another  we accrue for the amount representing the low end of the range in accordance with asc topic as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending contingencies and litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions of our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
additionally  if the final outcome of such litigation differs adversely from that currently expected  it would result in a charge to earnings when determined

the following tables set forth our outstanding contractual obligations  including related party leases  as of july  less than year years years greater than years total dollars in thousands senior subordinated notes due interest payments on debt excluding capital leases capital lease obligations including interest operating lease obligations employment agreements purchase and other contractual obligations total purchase and other contractual obligations in the above table primarily include vehicles and equipment ordered under contract but not yet received by the company 
our consolidated balance sheet as of july  includes a long term liability of approximately million for accrued insurance claims 
this liability has been excluded from the above table as the timing of any cash payments is uncertain 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our accrued insurance claims liability 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions at july  was million and is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
this amount has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the resolution of the underlying tax positions with the relevant tax authorities 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have obligations under performance bonds related to certain of our customer contracts 
performance bonds generally provide a customer with the right to obtain payment and or performance from the issuer of the bond if we fail to perform our obligations under a contract 
as of july   we had million of outstanding performance bonds and no events have occurred in which customers have exercised their rights under the performance bonds 
sufficiency of capital resources 
we believe that our capital resources  including existing cash balances and amounts available under our credit agreement  are sufficient to meet our financial obligations 
these obligations include interest payments required on our notes and borrowings  working capital requirements  and the normal replacement of equipment at our current level of operations for at least the next twelve months 
our future operating results and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors including our success in bidding on future contracts and our ability to manage costs effectively 
to the extent we seek to grow by acquisitions that involve consideration other than our stock  or to the extent we buyback our common st ock or repurchase or call our senior subordinated notes  our capital requirements may increase 
although the distress in the financial markets has not significantly impacted our financial position as of july   management continues to monitor the financial markets and assess general economic conditions 
if further changes in financial markets or other areas of the economy adversely impact our ability to access capital markets  we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the existing committed credit facility to provide short term funding 
we believe that our cash investment policies are conservative and we expect that the current volatility in the capital markets will not have a material impact on our cash investments 
backlog 
our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under master service agreements and other long term requirements contracts 
many of our contracts are multi year agreements  and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience with customers and  more generally our experience in procurements of this type 
in many instances  our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract 
our estimates of a customer s requirements during a particular future period may not prove to be accurate  particularly in light of the current economic conditions and the uncertainty that imposes on changes in our customer s requirements for our services 
our backlog totaled billion and million at july  and july   respectively 
we expect to complete of the july  backlog during fiscal 
table of contents seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our revenues are affected by seasonality as a significant portion of the work we perform is outdoors 
consequently  our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
generally  inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season which falls during our second and third fiscal quarters 
also  a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our second quarter  which decreases the number of available workdays 
additionally  our customer premise equipment installation activities for cable providers historically decrease around calendar year end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period 
as a result  we may experience reduced revenue in the second or third quarters of our fiscal years 
in addition  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly variations in revenues and net income as a result of other factors  including our fiscal year which ends on the last saturday in july  and as a result  fiscal consisted of weeks with the fourth quarter having weeks of operations  as compared to other fiscal years consisting of weeks with the fourth quarter having weeks  the timing and volume of customers construction and maintenance projects  seasonal budgetary spending patterns of customers and the timing of their budget approvals  the commencement or termination of master service agreements and other long term agreements with customers  costs incurred to support growth internally or through acquisitions  fluctuations in results of operations caused by acquisitions  fluctuations in the employer portion of payroll taxes as a result of reaching the limitation on payroll withholding obligations  changes in the mix of customers  contracts  and business activities  fluctuations in insurance expense due to changes in claims experience and actuarial assumptions  fluctuations in stock based compensation expense as a result of performance criteria in performance based share awards  as well as the timing and vesting period of all stock based awards  fluctuations in incentive pay as a result of operating results  fluctuations in interest expense due to levels of debt and related borrowing costs  fluctuations in other income as a result of the timing and levels of capital assets sold during the period  and fluctuations in income tax expense due to levels of taxable earnings and non deductible items 
accordingly  operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates on our cash and equivalents and our debt obligations 
we monitor the effects of market changes on interest rates and manage interest rate risks by investing in short term cash equivalents with market rates of interest and by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase to annual earnings of approximately million if our cash and equivalents held as of july  were to be fully invested in interest bearing financial instruments 
our revolving credit facility permits borrowings at a variable rate of interest  however  we had no outstanding borrowings as of july  outstanding long term debt at july  included approximately million of our senior subordinated notes due in  which bear a fixed rate of interest of 
due to the fixed rate of interest on the notes  changes in interest rates would not have an impact on the related interest expense 
the fair value of the outstanding notes totaled approximately million as of july   based on quoted market prices 
there exists market risk sensitivity on the fair value of the fixed rate notes with respect to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point change in the market interest rates in effect would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the notes of approximately million  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
we also have market risk for foreign currency exchange rates related to our operations in canada 
as of july   the market risk for foreign currency exchange rates was not significant as our operations in canada have not been material
