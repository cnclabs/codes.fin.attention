overview the company operates in three business segments 
the overnight air cargo segment  comprised of its mountain air cargo  inc mac and csa air  inc csa subsidiaries  operates in the air express delivery services industry 
the ground equipment sales segment  comprised of its global ground support  llc ggs subsidiary  manufactures and provides mobile deicers and other specialized equipment products to passenger and cargo airlines  airports  the u 
s 
military and industrial customers 
the ground support services segment  comprised of its global aviation services  llc gas subsidiary  provides ground support equipment maintenance and facilities maintenance services to domestic airlines and aviation service providers 
each business segm ent has separate management teams and infrastructures that offer different products and services 
the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on operating income 
following is a table detailing revenues by segment and by major customer category in thousands year ended march  overnight air cargo segment fedex ground equipment sales segment military commercial domestic commercial international ground support services segment mac and csa are short haul express airfreight carriers and provide air cargo services to one primary customer  fedex corporation fedex 
mac also on occasion provides maintenance services to other airline customers and the u 
s 
military 
under the terms of dry lease service agreements  which currently cover all of the revenue aircraft  the company receives a monthly administrative fee based on the number of aircraft operated and passes through to its customer certain cost components of its operations without markup 
the cost of fuel  flight crews  landing fees  outside maintenance  parts and certain other direct operating costs are included in operating expenses and billed to the customer as cargo and maintenance revenue  at cost 
pursuant to such agreements  fedex determin es the type of aircraft and schedule of routes to be flown by mac and csa  with all other operational decisions made by the company 
these agreements are renewable on two to five year terms and may be terminated by fedex at any time upon days notice 
the company believes that the short term and other provisions of its agreements with fedex are standard within the airfreight contract delivery service industry 
fedex has been a customer of the company since loss of its contracts with fedex would have a material adverse effect on the company 
mac and csa combined revenues decreased by  in fiscal the decrease in revenues was primarily related to a decrease in flight and maintenance department costs passed through to its customer at cost as a result of the decrease in revenue aircraft operated over the past two years 
ggs manufactures and supports aircraft deicers and other specialized industrial equipment on a worldwide basis 
ggs manufactures five basic models of mobile deicing equipment with capacities ranging from to  gallons 
ggs also provides fixed pedestal mounted deicers 
each model can be customized as requested by the customer  including single operator configuration  fire suppressant equipment  open basket or enclosed cab design  a patented forced air deicing nozzle and on board glycol blending system to substantially reduce glycol usage  color and style of the exterior finish 
ggs also manufactures five models of scissor lift equipment  for catering  cabin service and maintenance service of aircraft  and has developed a line of decontamination equipment  glycol recovery vehicles and other special purpose mobile equipment 
ggs competes primarily on the basis of the quality  performance and reliability of its products  prompt delivery  customer service and price 
in june  ggs was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force 
ggs was awarded two three year extensions of that contract through june on july   the company announced that ggs had been awarded a new contract to supply deicing trucks to the united states air force 
the contract award was for one year with four additional one year extensi on options that may be exercised by the united states air force 
ggs contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the  decrease in revenues was largely due to a decrease in the number of military deicing units delivered during the current year as the company has had a substantial reduction in orders from the united states air force 
gas was formed in september to operate the aircraft ground support equipment and airport facility maintenance services business of the company 
gas is providing aircraft ground support equipment and airport facility maintenance services to a wide variety of customers at a number of locations throughout the country 
gas contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the  increase in revenues was due to the growth and expansion of gas as it continued to expand existing locations as well as add new customers and new service locations 
gas has grown to of consolidated revenues for the year ended march  fiscal highlights after three consecutive years of record gross revenues and net profits  the company experienced a decline in both in the fiscal year ended march   reflecting very difficult economic and industry conditions 
we remain dedicated to conserving cash  watching and controlling costs and maintaining  as well as expanding  our customer and vendor relationships 
during the year ended march   revenues from our gas subsidiary totaled  this relatively new line of business continues to expand its customer base 
gas has been able to add additional customers this year  but more importantly continue to develop existing customers and locations to improve utilization of our staff 
our overnight air cargo segment saw its operating income decrease by  or in fiscal as a result of a reduction in the number of aircraft operated for fedex over the past two years 
we operated aircraft for our customer at march   aircraft at march  and aircraft at march  the reduction in aircraft has been a combination of retirement of the last of the aging fokker fleet  weather events that have destroyed aircraft while on ground  as well as our customer s decision to park aircraft due to current economic conditions 
as a result  we have experienced a  reduction in administrative fee revenue from our customer in the year ended march  without any corresponding reduction in overhead costs 
we also saw a significant reduction in revenu es relating to pass through costs to our customer including fuel  flight and maintenance salaries and other operating costs 
we are not aware of any plans to further reduce the number of aircraft we operate at this time  whether for economic or other reasons 
revenues for ggs for the year ended march  were down from the prior year  while operating income was also down  or 
ggs revenues were the highest in company history during the prior year ended march  and the decrease for the most recent fiscal year reflected the depressed industry and economic environment during the period 
ggs produced and delivered a high volume of deicers to the military in fiscal as well as a high volume of commercial catering trucks 
in addition  ggs delivered an increased number of commercial units to various international customers in fiscal sales in all of these segments were down in fiscal but particularly sales to the united states air force 
while ggs was able to renew the contract with the air force in july  ggs received no orders under this contract during fiscal  which resulted in reduced sales in the current year as well as a reduced backlog at year end 
ggs s gross margin percentage was very comparable over the two years 
we expect that margins will decline in the coming year  in part as a result of reduced margins under the new contract with the united states air force  which was the result of a highly competitive bid process 
the final outstanding matter with respect to the philadelphia boom incident was settled during the year 
the final claim involved replacing the damaged deicing boom for the city of philadelphia and that was completed in march with minimal financial impact to the company 
fiscal vs 
consolidated revenue decreased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in revenue resulted from a decrease in air cargo revenue of  to  combined with a decrease in ground equipment sales revenue of  to  and a partially offsetting increase in ground support services revenue of  to  the decrease in air cargo revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in flight and maintenance department costs passed through to its customer at cost as a result of the decrease in revenue aircraft operated over the past two years 
the decrease in ground equipment revenue was the result of a significant decrease in the number of military and international deicers as we ll as commercial catering trucks sold in fiscal compared to the ground support services segment was a bright spot in fiscal  as it contributed increased revenues in fiscal reflecting its continued growth in customers and locations in the past year 
operating expenses on a consolidated basis decreased  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was due to a number of factors 
operating expenses in the air cargo segment were down  primarily as a result of decreased flight and maintenance costs passed through to its customer at cost 
ground equipment sales operating costs decreased   driven primarily by the current year s decrease in units sold 
the ground support services segment reported a  increase in operating expenses directly related to the increased revenue and level of operations provided by gas over the past year 
general and administrative expense decreased  to  in fiscal the gas subsidiary experienced a continued increase in its general and administrative expense in the amount of  associated with the continuing growth and expansion of its operations 
the company incurred reduced compensation expense of  related to stock options 
we also experienced a  decrease in professional fees in fiscal profit sharing expense decreased by  directly related to the decreased profit generated by the company in fiscal operating income for the year ended march  was  a  decrease from fiscal the reduction was principally the result of the reduction of revenue aircraft in the air cargo segment and the decrease in units sold in the ground equipment sales segment 
the continued growth and maturation of our relatively new ground support services segment resulted in its increased operating income and partially offset the decreases in the other two segments 
non operating income  net for the year ended march  was  a  decrease from fiscal the  lawsuit settlement income recorded in december was a principal component of this decrease 
this income was partially offset by the  retirement plan settlement expense also recorded in december  relating to the amendment of a key employee s employment agreement 
interest expense decreased by  as the company elected to utilize its available cash to minimize line of credit usage and also to reduce the chassis flooring during the year 
investment income increased by  as a result of the increase in invested cash in the current year 
income tax expense of  in fiscal represented an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate is unusually low compared to the u 
s 
federal statutory rate of primarily due to a true up of federal income taxes on prior year tax filings  the benefit of foreign tax credits  as well as the continuing benefit of the us production deduction 
income tax expense of  in fiscal represented an effective tax rate of  which included the benefit of municipal bond income as well as the us production deduction 
net earnings were  or per diluted share for the year ended march   a decrease from earnings of  or per diluted share in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company held approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
of this amount  million was invested in liquid money market accounts  certificates of deposit placed through an account registry service cdars with original maturities ranging from days to weeks and a month bank certificate of deposit 
all invested amounts are fully insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  with the exception of million held in money market accounts 
as of march   the company s working capital amounted to  an increase of  compared to march  the increase resulted principally from the earnings generated from operations  which is our primary source of liquidity 
the company has a  secured long term revolving credit line with an expiration date of august  the revolving credit line contains customary events of default  a subjective acceleration clause and a fixed charge coverage requirement  with which the company was in compliance at march  the company had no outstanding obligations under its line of credit at march  and see note in the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report  for further discussion 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on its line of credit 
although the line had no outstanding balance at march  and  the line of credit did have a weighted average balance outstanding of approximately  during the year ended march  if the libor interest rate had been increased by one percentage point  based on the weighted average balance outstanding for the year  the change in annual interest expense would have been negligible 
in march  the company utilized its revolving credit line to acquire a corporate aircraft for  in april  the company refinanced the aircraft under a secured fixed rate five year term loan  based on a ten year amortization with a balloon payment at the end of the fifth year 
the balloon payment of approximately  was paid in full in april with cash from operations 
following is a table of changes in cash flow for the respective years ended march  and year ended march  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities was  less for fiscal compared to fiscal the major component of this decrease was in accounts receivable which decreased significantly in fiscal  while decreasing only marginally in fiscal inventories decreased by approximately million in fiscal to partially offset the accounts receivable impact 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal was  more than fiscal  largely due to the company increasing its position in short term investments 
in fiscal  capital expenditures decreased by  cash used in financing activities was  more in fiscal compared to fiscal principally due to the payoff of the aircraft term loan in fiscal there are currently no commitments for significant capital expenditures 
the company s board of directors  on august   adopted the policy to pay an annual cash dividend in the first quarter of each fiscal year  in an amount to be determined by the board 
on may  the company declared a 
per share cash dividend  to be paid on june  to shareholders of record june  off balance sheet arrangements the company defines an off balance sheet arrangement as any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development arrangements with the company 
the company is not currently engaged in the use of any of these arrangements 
impact of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its manufacturing operations  because increased costs to date have been passed on to its customers 
under the terms of its air cargo business contracts the major cost components of its operations  consisting principally of fuel  crew and other direct operating costs  and certain maintenance costs are reimbursed  without markup by its customer 
significant increases in inflation rates could  however  have a material impact on future revenue and operating income 
seasonality ggs s business has historically been seasonal 
the company has continued its efforts to reduce ggs s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by increasing military and international sales and broadening its product line to increase revenues and earnings throughout the year 
in june  ggs was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force  and subsequently was awarded two three year extensions on the contract  which expired in june in july  ggs was awarded a new one year contract with the united states air force with four additional one year extension options 
although sales remain somewhat seasonal  particularly with regard to commercial deicers which typically are delivered prior to the winter season  this diversificat ion has lessened the seasonal impacts in recent years and allowed the company to be more efficient in its planning and production 
if sales to the united states air force do not continue to be a significant component of ggs s sales  seasonal patterns of revenues and earnings attributable to its commercial deicer business may resume 
the overnight air cargo and ground support services segments are not susceptible to seasonal trends 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in
