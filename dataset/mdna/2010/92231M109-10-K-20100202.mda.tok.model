approximately of our net revenue was earned in the united states and of our net revenue was earned in international markets for both years ended december  and december  net revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  we recognized  of licensing revenue during the year ended december  as the result of our license agreement and device supply agreement with king and our distribution agreement with nicolai in germany 
we also recognized  of collaboration revenue during the year ended december  as a result of performing clinical and development work for king under the device supply agreement 
we expect to recognize approximately  of license revenue in we expect collaboration revenue will continue in but at a lower level due to us completing the enrollment of one of the clinical projects for king 
gross margin across all product lines increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  we expect product gross margins to be in the range of to in  subject to changes in our selling mix between our lower margin products such as the vari lase products and our higher margin products such as the d stat dry 
gross margin across all product lines declined to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  cost of sales related to thrombin inventory expenses were for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  cost of sales related to thrombin inventory expenses relate to a reserve we have recorded for the amount of thrombin we anticipate expiring prior to being used in the manufacturing of our international hemostat products 
we do not anticipate incurring additional charges related to thrombin inventory during collaboration expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  collaboration expenses primarily are the result of our collaboration revenue related to the pre clinical and clinical projects we are performing for king 
we expect collaboration expenses to be approximately of revenue during  dependent upon the timing of the collaboration revenue 
research and development expense for the year ended december  totaled  or of revenue  compared to  or of revenue for the year ended december  and  or of revenue for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses resulted from additional new products moving through our development system in we expect our continuing research and development expenses to be approximately to of revenue in as we continue to pursue additional new products and to move our longer term development projects forward 
clinical and regulatory expense for the year ended december  totaled  or of revenue  compared to  or of revenue for the year ended december  and  or of revenue for the year ended december  clinical and regulatory expenses fluctuate due to the timing of clinical studies and the number of new products coming through the regulatory system 
we expect clinical and regulatory expenses to be approximately to of revenue in sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  totaled  or of revenue  compared to  or of revenue for the year ended december  and  or of revenue for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in sales and marketing expenses was a  or increase in our commissions paid to our direct sales force due to increased sales in over we expect to maintain the same relative size of our direct sales force during at between and full time sales employees 
as a result  we expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to decrease as a percent of revenue from approximately to of revenue at the beginning of to between and of revenue by the end of general and administrative expense for the year ended december  totaled  or of revenue  compared to  or of revenue for the year ended december  and  or of revenue for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of lower legal fees of approximately  as we settled the diomed and covidien litigation matters in the second half of see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this form k 
we expect general and administrative expenses to be approximately to of revenue during litigation expenses were for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  we did not recognize any gain resulting from the marine polymer jury verdict 
we received million from marine polymer on january  and the gain will be recognized in the first quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this form k 
in the second quarter of we recorded a gain of  due to the settlement of our litigation with diomed reflecting a reduction from the  litigation expense incurred in due to the diomed jury verdict and a litigation expense of  upon the settlement of the litigation with covidien see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this form k 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily the result of lower interest rates being paid on our deposit funds held at the bank 
interest expense decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was as a result of repaying our equipment line of credit during the year ended december  foreign exchange loss decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  income tax expense increased to  on income before taxes of  resulting in an income tax rate of for the year ended december   compared to an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  and income tax expense of  for the year ended december  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income during the fourth quarter of each year 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance necessary to offset our deferred tax assets that will not be recoverable 
based upon management s assessment of all available evidence  including our cumulative pretax net income for fiscal years and  estimates of future profitability and the overall prospects of our business  we determined that our current deferred tax assets are adequate at december  in the fourth quarter of we determined it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  and as a result recorded a million income tax benefit 
to determine the amount of the reduction in the valuation allowance  we projected our income over the next five years  which approximates the ten year life of our three most significant products at this time 
the amount of the valuation allowance reduction was based on our discounted projected taxable income 
we will continue to assess the potential realization of our deferred tax assets on an annual basis or on an interim basis if circumstances warrant 
if our actual results and updated projections vary significantly from our prior estimates  we expect to increase or decrease our valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets 
any adjustment to our earnings for the deferred tax would occur in the period we make the determination 
with the exception of and  we have not generated any significant pre tax income in any year and therefore have not paid any federal income taxes since our inception in december as of december   we had approximately million and million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income which begin to expire in the year as of december   we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million which begin to expire in the year as of december   we also had a foreign tax loss carryforward of approximately  which does not expire 
under the united states tax reform act of  the amounts of and benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances  including significant changes in ownership interests 
future use of our existing net operating loss carryforwards may be restricted due to changes in ownership or from future tax legislation 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december  compared to  in cash and cash equivalents at december   an increase of  our cash equivalents are invested in a money market fund invested in all types of high quality  short term money market instruments denominated in us dollars such as debt instruments guaranteed by the governments of the united states  western europe  australia  japan and canada  high quality corporate issuers and bank obligations 
the money market fund s assets are rated in the highest short term category by nationally recognized rating agencies  such as moody s or standard poor s 
cash provided by operations 
we generated  of cash from operations during the year ended december  the cash generated during primarily resulted from our income before taxes of  since essentially all of our income taxes are offset by our deferred tax assets 
cash used for investing activities 
we used  of cash in investing activities during the year ended december  we incurred capital expenditures of  relating primarily to additional manufacturing equipment  leasehold improvements as part of our facility expansion and additional research and development equipment 
cash provided by financing activities 
we generated  of cash in financing activities during the year ended december  we used  of cash to repurchase shares that vested under outstanding restricted stock awards for income tax withholding purposes 
this was offset by our receipt of  of cash we received under our employee stock purchase plan and upon the exercise of outstanding stock options 
we have a million revolving line of credit with us bank  which has a month term  bears interest at the rate of libor plus and is secured by a first security interest on all of our assets 
the credit facility includes one covenant that we cannot have a maximum cash flow leverage ratio greater than to the calculation of this covenant is determined by multiplying our annual lease expenses times six and adding any loans  then dividing this amount by the sum of our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and our annual operating lease payments 
we were in compliance with this covenant on december  as of december   we had no outstanding balance on the million revolving line of credit with an availability of million 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash commitments as of december  payments due by period less than year more than years contractual obligation total years years facility operating leases we do not have any other significant cash commitments related to supply agreements  nor do we have any significant commitments for capital expenditures 
we currently anticipate that we will experience positive cash flow from our normal operating activities for the foreseeable future 
we currently believe that our working capital of million at december  will be sufficient to meet all of our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  our actual liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous unpredictable factors  including the amount of revenues from sales of our existing and new products  the cost of maintaining  enforcing and defending patents and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments related to regulatory and third party reimbursement matters  and other factors 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and that require complex management judgment 
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the estimated value of excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of its net realizable value is established by us on a quarterly basis through review of inventory on hand and assessment of future demand  anticipated release of new products into the market  historical experience and product expiration 
our stated value of inventory could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of competitive conditions or market acceptance  or if products become obsolete because of advancements in the industry 
we have approximately million of sigma thrombin in inventory at december   which we expect to use in our hemostat products sold in international markets 
we received regulatory approval in february allowing us to use the sigma thrombin in our international hemostat products 
in the fourth quarter of we wrote off  of our sigma thrombin which we expect will expire before we are able to use it 
we will continue to review our sigma thrombin needs and we will write off any amounts we anticipate will not be used 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  
asc s  which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectability is reasonably assured  and iv product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
we recognize revenue as products are shipped based on fob shipping point terms when title passes to customers 
we negotiate credit terms on a customer by customer basis and products are shipped at an agreed upon price 
all product returns must be pre approved and  if approved  customers are subject to a restocking charge 
we also generate revenues from license agreements and research collaborations and recognizes these revenues when earned 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  
asc  for deliverables which contain multiple deliverables  the company separates the deliverables into separate accounting units if they meet the following criteria i the delivered items have a stand alone value to the customer  ii the fair value of any undelivered items can be reliably determined  and iii if the arrangement includes a general right of return  delivery of the undelivered items is probable and substantially controlled by the seller 
deliverables that do not meet these criteria are combined with one or more other deliverables into one accounting unit 
revenue from each accounting unit is recognized based on the applicable accounting literature  primarily staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition

effective april  we entered into a five year distribution agreement with nicolai  gmbh 
as a result of entering into this distribution agreement  we no longer maintain a direct sales force in germany 
in connection with this distribution agreement  we received  euros from nicolai  gmbh in the payment was deferred and is being recognized ratably over the five year term of the distribution agreement 
the distribution agreement also includes provisions requiring us to pay nicolai  gmbh specific amounts if we terminate the distribution agreement prior to the end of the five year term 
we do not intend to terminate the distribution agreement and  as such  have not recorded a liability relating to these potential future payments to nicolai  gmbh 
on january   we entered into three separate agreements with king  consisting of a license agreement  a device supply agreement and a thrombin jmi supply agreement 
we licensed the exclusive rights to our products thrombi pad  thrombi gel and thrombi paste to king for a one time payment of million 
we continue to manufacture the licensed products for sale to king under the device supply agreement 
the device supply agreement requires king to pay us a million milestone payment upon the first commercial sale of thrombi gel and again upon the first commercial sale of thrombi paste 
on may  we received the first million payment related to king s first commercial sale of thrombi pad 
in king decided to suspend indefinitely the clinical development of the thrombi paste product 
we are amortizing the million license fee received on january  and the million milestone payment received on may  on a straight line basis over the remaining years 
we will amortize the second million milestone payment over the remaining year license period from the date it is received 
as part of the device supply agreement  we agreed to conduct clinical studies for thrombi gel and thrombi paste  with the expected costs related to the clinical studies to be paid by king 
additionally  on may   we entered into a product development supply agreement with a third party company by which we agreed to develop  manufacture and sell to this company a specialty version of our twin pass dual access catheter  with the costs related to the development paid by this company 
we have recognized collaboration revenue on these development agreements as it was earned under the agreements with king and the third party company 
no revenue was recognized under the product development supply agreement with the third party company for the year ended december  and none is expected in in addition  we have reviewed the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements  
asc  and believe the adoption of this eitf will have no impact on the amounts recorded under these agreements 
we analyze the rate of historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which is included with the allowance for doubtful accounts on our balance sheet 
at december   this reserve was  compared to  at december  if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be overstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
at december   this reserve was  compared to  at december  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty costs we provide a warranty for certain products against defects in material and workmanship for periods of up to months 
we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the amount we are charged by our original equipment manufacturer to cover the warranty period 
the original equipment manufacturer includes a one year warranty with each product sold to us 
we record a liability for the uncovered warranty period offered to a customer  provided the warranty period offered exceeds the initial one year warranty period covered by the original equipment manufacturer 
at december   this warranty provision was  compared to  at december  if the assumptions used in calculating the provision were to materially change  resulting in more defects than anticipated  an additional provision may be required 
income taxes the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the united states based on estimates and assumptions 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million valuation allowance and a  reserve related to our net deferred tax assets of million as a result of our adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 
asc 
at december   we have accrued for the payment of tax related interest and there was no tax interest or penalties recognized in the statements of operations 
in the fourth quarter of  based upon management s assessment of all available evidence  including our cumulative adjusted pretax net income for fiscal years and adjusted for certain non recurring items allowed by fas  
asc  estimates of future profitability and the overall prospects of our business  we determined that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  and as a result recorded a million income tax benefit 
to determine the amount of the reduction in the valuation allowance  we projected our income over the next five years  which approximates the ten year life of our three most significant products at this time 
the amount of the valuation allowance reduction was based on our discounted projected taxable income 
we continue to assess the potential realization of our deferred tax assets on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if circumstances warrant 
if our actual results and updated projections vary significantly from our projections  we would need to increase or decrease our valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets 
we would adjust our earnings for the deferred tax in the period we make the determination 
no additional income tax benefits have been recorded for the year ended december  new accounting pronouncement in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 
fas  
asc 
this standard establishes the fasb accounting standards codification the codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
the codification does not change current us gaap  but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative us gaap by providing all the authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place 
the codification was effective for interim and annual periods ending after september   and as of the effective date  all existing accounting standard documents have been superseded 
the codification was effective for us in the third quarter of  and accordingly  our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ending september  and all subsequent public filings will reference the codification as the sole source of authoritative literature 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables 
we maintain our accounts for cash and cash equivalents principally at one major bank and one investment firm in the united states 
we have a formal written investment policy that restricts the placement of investments to issuers evaluated as creditworthy 
we have not experienced any losses on our deposits of our cash and cash equivalents 
with respect to accounts receivable  we perform credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral 
there have been no material losses on accounts receivables 
in the united states we sell our products directly to hospitals and clinics 
in international markets  we sell our products to independent distributors who  in turn  sell to medical clinics 
we sell our product in these countries through independent distributors denominated in united states dollars  with the exception of germany  where sales are denominated in euros 
we do not believe our operations are currently subject to significant market risks for interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other relevant market price risks of a material nature 
a change of in the euro exchange would result in an increase or decrease of approximately  in the amount of united states dollars we receive in payment on accounts receivable from nicolai  gmbh 
under our current policies  we do not use foreign currency derivative instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate 
we currently have no indebtedness  but if we were to borrow amounts from our revolving credit line  we would be exposed to changes in interest rates 
advances under our revolving credit line bear interest at an annual rate indexed to libor 
we will thus be exposed to interest rate risk with respect to amounts outstanding under the line of credit to the extent that interest rates rise 
as we had no amounts outstanding on the line of credit at december   we have no exposure to interest rate changes on this credit facility 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
additionally  we will be exposed to declines in the interest rates paid on deposited funds 
a decline in the current market interest rates paid on deposits would result in interest income being reduced by approximately  on an annual basis
