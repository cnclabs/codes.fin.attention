item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on our current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those we discuss under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
general we are a leading provider of enterprise software applications and related services to the education industry 
our clients use our software to integrate technology into the education experience and campus life  and to support activities such as a professor assigning digital materials on a class website  a student collaborating with peers or completing research online  an administrator managing a departmental website  a superintendant sending mass communications via voice  email and text messages to parents and students  or a merchant conducting cash free transactions with students and faculty through pre funded debit accounts 
our clients include colleges  universities  schools and other education providers  textbook publishers  student focused merchants  and corporate and government clients 
we generate revenues from sales and licensing of products and from professional services 
our product revenues consist principally of revenues from annual software licenses  subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand application services  client hosting engagements and the sale of bundled software hardware systems 
we typically sell our licenses and hosting services under annually renewable agreements  and our clients generally pay the annual fees at the beginning of the contract term 
we recognize revenues from these agreements  as well as revenues from bundled software hardware systems  which do not recur  ratably over the contractual term  which is typically months 
we initially record billings associated with licenses and hosting services as deferred revenues and then recognize them ratably into revenues over the contract term 
we also generate product revenues from the sale and licensing of third party software and hardware that is not bundled with our software 
we generally recognize these revenues upon shipment of the products to our clients 
we derive professional services revenues primarily from training  implementation  installation and other consulting services 
we perform substantially all of our professional services on a time and materials basis 
we recognize these revenues as the services are performed 
we have grown through internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
in january  we acquired the nti group  inc  or nti 
this acquisition allowed us to offer clients the ability to send mass communications via voice  email and text messages 
we acquired the technology underlying our blackboard connect service  which we began offering in february  from nti 
in may  we acquired angel learning  inc  or angel  a leading developer of e learning software to the us education industry 
in july  we acquired the business assets of terriblyclever design  llc  which provides the foundation for our newest platform  blackboard mobile 
blackboard mobile allows us to offer our clients a comprehensive suite of mobile web applications for education and enables educational institutions to deliver education and campus life services and content to mobile devices to connect students  parents  faculty  prospective students and alumni to the campus experience 
we typically license our individual applications either on a stand alone basis or bundled as part of one of our four platforms blackboard learn tm  blackboard transact tm  blackboard connect tm  and blackboard mobile tm 
we offer blackboard learn in all of our markets  blackboard transact primarily to us and canadian postsecondary clients  blackboard connect to primarily us k  postsecondary and government clients  and blackboard mobile primarily to us postsecondary and k clients 
we also offer application hosting for clients who prefer to outsource the management of their blackboard learn systems 
in addition to our 
table of contents products  we offer a variety of professional services  including strategic consulting  project management  custom application development and training 
we generally price our software licenses on the basis of full time equivalent students or users 
accordingly  annual license fees are generally greater for larger institutions 
our operating expenses consist of cost of product revenues  cost of professional services revenues  research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions 
major components of our cost of product revenues include license and other fees that we owe to third parties upon licensing software  and the cost of hardware that we bundle with our software 
we initially defer these costs and recognize them into expense over the period in which we recognize the related revenue 
cost of product revenues also includes amortization of internally developed technology available for sale  telecommunications costs related to the blackboard connect product  all direct materials and shipping and handling costs  employee compensation  including bonuses  stock based compensation and benefits for personnel supporting our hosting  support and production functions  as well as related facility rent  communication costs  utilities  depreciation expense and cost of external professional services used in these functions 
we expense all of these costs as incurred 
we also expense the costs of third party software and hardware that is not bundled with software as we incur these costs  normally upon delivery to our client 
cost of product revenues excludes amortization of acquired technology intangibles resulting from acquisitions  which is included as amortization of intangibles acquired in acquisitions 
amortization expense related to acquired technology was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cost of professional services revenues primarily includes the costs of compensation  including bonuses  stock based compensation and benefits for employees and external consultants who are involved in the performance of professional services engagements for our clients  as well as travel and related costs  facility rent  communication costs  utilities and depreciation expense used in these functions 
we expense all of these costs as incurred 
research and development expenses include the costs of compensation  including bonuses  stock based compensation and benefits for employees who are associated with the creation and testing of the products we offer  as well as the costs of external professional services  travel and related costs attributable to the creation and testing of our products  related facility rent  communication costs  utilities and depreciation expense used in these functions 
we expense all of these costs as incurred 
sales and marketing expenses include the costs of compensation  including bonuses and commissions  stock based compensation and benefits for employees who are associated with the generation of revenues  as well as marketing expenses  costs of external marketing related professional services  investor relations  facility rent  utilities  communications  travel attributable to those sales and marketing employees in the generation of revenues and bad debt expense 
we expense all of these costs as incurred 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of compensation  including bonuses  stock based compensation and benefits for employees in the human resources  legal  finance and accounting  management information systems  facilities management  executive management and other administrative functions that are not directly associated with the generation of revenues or the creation and testing of products 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include the costs of external professional services and insurance  as well as related facility rent  communication costs  utilities and depreciation expense used in these functions 
we expense all of these costs as incurred 
amortization of intangibles includes the amortization of costs associated with products  acquired technology  customer lists  non compete agreements and other identifiable intangible assets 
we recorded these intangible assets at the time of our acquisitions and relate to contractual agreements  technology and products that we continue to utilize in our business 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
during the preparation of these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  fair value measures  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  fixed assets  long lived assets  including purchase accounting and goodwill  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from two sources product sales and professional services sales 
product revenues include software license fees  subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand application services  hardware  premium support and maintenance  and hosting revenues 
professional services revenues include revenues from training and consulting services 
our software does not require significant modification and customization services 
where services are not essential to the functionality of the software  we begin to recognize software licensing revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we do not have vendor specific objective evidence  known as vsoe  of fair value for our support and maintenance separate from our software for the majority of our products 
accordingly  when licenses are sold in conjunction with our support and maintenance  we recognize the license revenue over the term of the maintenance service period 
when licenses of certain offerings are sold in conjunction with our support and maintenance where we do have vsoe  we recognize the license revenue upon delivery of the license and recognize the support and maintenance revenue over the term of the maintenance service period 
we sell hardware in two types of transactions sales of hardware in conjunction with our software licenses  which we refer to as bundled hardware software systems  and sales of hardware without software  which generally involve the resale of third party hardware 
after any necessary installation services are performed  we recognize hardware revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we have not determined vsoe of the fair value for the separate components of bundled hardware software systems 
accordingly  when a bundled hardware software system is sold  we recognize all revenue over the term of the maintenance service period 
we recognize hardware sales without software upon delivery of the hardware to our client 
we adopted new accounting standards on january  under these new accounting standards  we will generally recognize the product revenues and cost of product revenues related to hardware and software sales in the blackboard transact product line upfront upon delivery of product to customers 
prior to the adoption of these new accounting standards  we generally recognized revenues on such sales ratably over the term of the agreement 
we recognize hosting revenues and set up fees ratably over the term of the hosting agreement 
our sales arrangements may include professional services sold separately under professional services agreements that include training and consulting services 
we account for revenues from these arrangements separately from the license revenue because they meet the criteria for separate accounting 
the more significant factors we consider in determining whether revenue should be accounted for separately include the 
table of contents nature of the professional services  such as consideration of whether the professional services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of professional services from other vendors and timing of payments 
we recognize professional services revenues that are sold separately from license revenue as the professional services are performed on a time and materials basis 
we do not offer specified upgrades or incrementally significant discounts 
we record advance payments as deferred revenues until the product is shipped  services are delivered or obligations are met and the revenue can be recognized 
deferred revenues represent the excess of amounts invoiced over amounts recognized as revenues 
we provide non specified upgrades of our product only on a when and if available basis 
any contingencies  such as rights of return  conditions of acceptance  warranties and price protection are accounted for as a separate element 
the effect of accounting for these contingencies included in revenue arrangements has not been material 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our clients to make required payments 
we analyze accounts receivable  historical percentages of uncollectible accounts and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we use an internal collection effort  which may include our sales and services groups as we deem appropriate 
although we believe that our reserves are adequate  if the financial condition of our clients deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if we underestimate the allowances required  additional allowances may be necessary  which would result in increased expense in the period in which such determination is made 
fair value measurements 
we evaluate the fair value of certain assets and liabilities using the following fair value hierarchy which ranks the quality and reliability of inputs  or assumptions  used in the determination of fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level inputs other than level quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable level unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data we evaluate assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring and nonrecurring basis to determine the appropriate level to classify them for each reporting period 
this determination requires us to make significant judgments 
assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non recurring basis include intangible assets and goodwill 
we recognize these items at fair value when they are considered to be impaired 
during the year ended december   there were no fair value adjustments for assets and liabilities measured on a non recurring basis 
during the year ended december   we transferred our investment in a common stock warrant of a private company out of level to level the classification of an instrument as level or level involves judgment based on a variety of subjective factors  including determining whether a market is considered inactive based on an evaluation of the frequency and size of transactions occurring in a certain financial instrument or similar class of financial instruments 
determining an inactive market requires a judgmental evaluation that includes comparing the recent trading activities to historical experience 
during the year ended december   we determined that although some market data was available  the investment in the common stock warrant was principally valued using our own assumptions in calculating the estimate of fair value including a discounted cash flow and comparable company analysis 
we disclose fair value information about financial instruments  whether or not recognized in the balance sheet  for which it is practicable to estimate that value 
due to their short term nature  the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements approximate the fair value for accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
business combinations 
we recognize all of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
on january   we adopted accounting guidance which was intended to simplify existing guidance and converge rulemaking under us generally accepted accounting principles with international accounting standards 
we recognize 
table of contents acquisition related costs separately from the acquisition and expense them as incurred 
we generally expense restructuring costs in periods subsequent to the acquisition date 
all subsequent changes to a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position that relate to the acquired company and existed at the acquisition date that occur both within the measurement period and as a result of facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date are recognized as an adjustment to goodwill 
all other changes in valuation allowance are recognized as a reduction or increase to income tax expense or as a direct adjustment to additional paid in capital as required 
we capitalize acquired in process research and development as an intangible asset and amortize it over its estimated useful life 
for acquisitions prior to  we capitalized acquisition related costs as part of the purchase price 
long lived assets 
we record our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  at cost 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
we evaluate these assets by examining estimated future cash flows to determine if their current recorded value is impaired 
we evaluate these cash flows by using weighted probability techniques as well as comparisons of past performance against projections 
assets may also be evaluated by identifying independent market values 
if we determine that an asset s carrying value is impaired  we will record a write down of the carrying value of the identified asset and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period in which the determination is made 
although we believe that the carrying values of our long lived assets are appropriately stated  changes in strategy or market conditions or significant technological developments could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
goodwill and intangible assets 
as the result of acquisitions  we record any excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill 
a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to tangible and intangible net assets acquired is based upon a preliminary valuation  and our estimates and assumptions may be subject to change 
we test our goodwill for impairment annually on october  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred  by comparing its fair value to its carrying value 
impairment may result from  among other things  deterioration in the performance of the acquired business  adverse market conditions  adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations  including changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business  and a variety of other circumstances 
if we determine that an impairment has occurred  we are required to record a write down of the carrying value and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period the determination is made 
although we believe goodwill is appropriately stated in our consolidated financial statements  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an adjustment to the recorded balance 
we also analyze our patents to determine whether some or all of the costs of defending and protecting patents may be capitalized 
we expense all costs incurred prior to filing a patent application as incurred 
notes payable 
on january   we adopted a new standard issued by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  on accounting for convertible debt instruments which requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
we amortize the resulting debt discount over the period the convertible debt is expected to be outstanding as additional non cash interest expense 
the standard requires retrospective application 
accordingly  our prior period consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of this standard 
in june  we issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due  which we refer to in this report as the notes  in a public offering 
the notes fall within the scope of the new convertible debt accounting standards because their terms include partial cash settlement 
accordingly  we account for the debt and conversion components of the notes separately 
we have determined that our nonconvertible borrowing rate at the time the notes were issued was 
accordingly  we estimated the fair value of the liability debt component as million upon issuance of the notes 
we allocated the excess of the proceeds received over the estimated fair value of the liability component totaling million  
table of contents to the conversion equity component 
we recorded the carrying amount of the equity component of the notes of million and million at december  and  respectively  as a debt discount and netted the amounts against the remaining principal amount outstanding on our consolidated balance sheets 
in connection with obtaining the notes  we incurred million in debt issuance costs  of which we allocated million to the liability component and million to the equity component 
we recorded the carrying amount of the liability component of the debt issuance costs of million and million at december  and  respectively  as a debt discount and netted the amounts against the remaining principal amount outstanding on our consolidated balance sheets 
we amortize the debt discount  which includes the equity component and the liability component of the debt issuance costs  as interest expense using the effective interest method through july   the first redemption date of the notes 
we recorded total interest expense of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  which consisted of million in interest expense at a rate of per year for each of the years ended december  and  and million and million in amortization of the debt discount for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the principal amount of the liability component of the notes was million at december  and the unamortized debt discount was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the net carrying amount of the liability component of the notes was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the impact of our adoption of this new standard on our results of operations for the years ended december   and is presented below in thousands  except for per share data year ended december  incremental as previously impact reported of adoption as adjusted interest expense provision benefit for income taxes net income loss net income loss per common share basic diluted year ended december  incremental as previously impact reported of adoption as adjusted interest expense provision benefit for income taxes net income loss net income loss per common share basic diluted

this new standard outlines a two step approach to evaluate the instrument s contingent exercise provisions and the instrument s settlement provisions 
we evaluated the provisions of the new standard and the embedded conversion options in the notes and determined that the embedded conversion options are indexed to our own stock and  therefore  do not require bifurcation and separate accounting 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we also recognize deferred tax assets for tax net operating loss carryforwards 
we measure these deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of total deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
income tax provision or benefit includes us federal  state and local and foreign income taxes and is based on pre tax income or loss 
all tax years since are subject to examination 
we account for income taxes using a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured as the largest amount of the tax benefits  determined on a cumulative probability basis  which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
all of our unrecognized tax benefit liability would affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefit liability as of december  to change significantly over the next months 
stock based compensation 
we measure and recognize compensation expense for stock based awards based on estimated fair values on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each stock option based award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
fair value estimates determined in 
table of contents accordance with this model are affected by our stock price  as well as estimates regarding a number of variables including expected stock price volatility over the term of the award and projected employee stock option exercise activity 
we estimate the fair value of our restricted stock based awards on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in october  the fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition with multiple elements 
the amended guidance allows the use of management s best estimate of selling price for individual elements of an arrangement when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is unavailable 
additionally  it eliminates the residual method of revenue recognition in accounting for multiple element arrangements 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   and early adoption is permitted 
in october  the fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue arrangements with software elements 
the amended guidance modifies the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
the pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   and early adoption is permitted 
this guidance must be adopted in the same period an entity adopts the amended revenue arrangements with multiple elements guidance described above 
we adopted these new accounting standards on january  under these new accounting standards  we will generally recognize the product revenues and cost of product revenues related to hardware and software sales in the blackboard transact product line upfront upon delivery of product to customers 
prior to the adoption of these new accounting standards  we generally recognized revenues on such sales ratably over the term of the agreement 
if we had always utilized these new accounting standards in and prior periods  our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for the year ended december  would not have been materially impacted 
important factors considered by management we consider several factors in evaluating both our financial position and our operating performance 
these factors  while primarily focused on relevant financial information  also include other measures such as general market and economic conditions  competitor information and the status of the regulatory environment 
to understand our financial results  it is important to understand our business model and its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting for the majority of our contracts requires us to initially record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheet upon invoicing the sale and then to recognize revenue in subsequent periods ratably over the term of the contract in our consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  to better understand our operations  we believe investors should look at both our revenues and deferred revenues 
in evaluating our revenues  we analyze them in three categories recurring ratable revenues  non recurring ratable revenues and other revenues 
recurring ratable revenues include those product revenues that are recognized ratably over the contract term  which is typically one year  and that recur each year assuming clients renew their contracts 
these revenues include revenues from the licensing of all of our software products  hosting arrangements  subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand application services and enhanced support and maintenance contracts related to our software products  including some professional services performed by our professional services groups 
non recurring ratable revenues include those product revenues that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically one year  but that do not contractually recur 
these revenues include some hardware components of our blackboard transact products and some third party hardware and software we sell to our clients in conjunction with our software licenses 

table of contents other revenues include those revenues that are recognized as earned and are not deferred to future periods 
these revenues include professional services  the sales of bbone  sales of licenses  as well as the supplies and commissions we earn from publishers related to digital course supplement downloads 
in the case of both recurring ratable revenues and non recurring ratable revenues  an increase or decrease in the revenues in one period would be attributable primarily to increases or decreases in sales in prior periods 
unlike recurring ratable revenues  which benefit both from new license sales and from the renewal of previously existing licenses  non recurring ratable revenues primarily reflect one time sales that do not contractually renew 
we adopted new accounting standards on january  under these new accounting standards  we will generally recognize the product revenues and cost of product revenues related to hardware and software sales in the blackboard transact product line upfront upon delivery of product to customers 
prior to the adoption of these new accounting standards  we generally recognized revenues on such sales ratably over the term of the agreement 
other factors that we consider in making strategic cash flow and operating decisions include cash flows from operations  capital expenditures  total operating expenses and earnings 
since  the global economy has been in a period of severe slowdown and the financial markets have experienced significant dislocation 
while our subscription license model and our focus on educational institution clients has partially insulated us from the negative impact experienced by other technology companies  we were not unaffected by these developments 
while our financial results for fiscal year were generally within our expectations  we believe that our financial results for would have been stronger had normal economic conditions prevailed during we believe that the economic slowdown and dislocation in the financial markets have caused some clients to delay their purchases with us causing a general lengthening of our sales cycles 
also  we believe that some clients may reduce or eliminate their purchases with us due to budgetary concerns and the uncertainty of operating in this environment 
budgetary restrictions are a particular concern for clients which rely on public funding as the budgets of many national  state or local governments have been negatively impacted by the economic slowdown and other factors 
though our products are often proven to be mission critical applications to our clients  we expect the continuing economic disruption to impact some of our publicly funded clients significantly which could result in the loss of expected new sales or our failure to retain existing clients 
in response to the changing economic climate  during  we managed our expenses more stringently 
similarly in  we expect to continue to manage our expenses in response to our sales and financial performance through the year 
in addition  our treasury policies favor lower yielding investments  such as investments issued or backed by the us treasury  in order to mitigate investment risks 
as the dislocation in the financial markets has continued  the yields on our investments have declined and reduced our interest income 
we expect to continue to earn yields on our cash and cash equivalents for the foreseeable future at rates which are below historic rates  which will negatively impact our profitability 
we believe that the full impact of the economic situation cannot currently be assessed and as a result  we will be required to make regular adjustments to our operating strategy in response to changing economic conditions 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth selected statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods indicated 
year ended december  revenues product professional services total revenues operating expenses cost of product revenues cost of professional services revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative patent proceeds impairment and other costs amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions total operating expenses operating margin the following table sets forth  for each component of revenues  the cost of these revenues expressed as a percentage of the related revenues for each of the periods indicated 
year ended december  cost of product revenues cost of professional services revenues year ended december  compared to year ended december  our total revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  a detail of our total revenues by classification is as follows year ended december  product professional product professional revenues services revenues total revenues services revenues total in millions unaudited recurring ratable revenues non recurring ratable revenues other revenues total revenues product revenues 
product revenues  including domestic and international  for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  recurring ratable product revenues increased by 
table of contents million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase in recurring ratable revenues was primarily due to a million increase in revenues recognized for subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand application services related to blackboard connect  which we acquired from nti in january the increase was also due to a million increase in revenues from blackboard learn enterprise licenses  which was attributable to current and prior period sales to new and existing clients  the continued shift of our existing clients from blackboard learn basic products to blackboard learn enterprise products and the cross selling of other enterprise products to existing clients 
blackboard learn enterprise products have additional functionality that is not available in blackboard learn basic products and consequently some blackboard learn basic product clients upgrade to blackboard learn enterprise products 
licenses of the enterprise version of blackboard learn products have higher average pricing  which normally results in at least twice the contractual value as compared to blackboard learn basic product licenses 
the remaining increase in recurring ratable product revenues primarily resulted from a million increase in hosting revenues and a million increase in revenues related to our arrangements with our technology and content partners 
the increase in other product revenues was primarily due to a million increase in revenues related to sales of our content management software products and a million increase in revenues related to sales of third party hardware and software products 
of our total revenues  our total international revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  international revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due to the increase in revenues from our blackboard connect product  which is primarily sold in the united states 
international product revenues  which consist primarily of recurring ratable product revenues  were million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in international recurring ratable product revenues was primarily due to an increase in international revenues from blackboard learn enterprise products and hosting resulting from prior period sales to new and existing clients 
in addition  the increase in international revenues also reflects our investment in increasing the size of our international sales force and international marketing efforts during prior periods  which expanded our international presence and enabled us to sell more of our products to new and existing clients in our international markets 
professional services revenues 
professional services revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in professional services revenues was primarily attributable to increased sales of consulting services 
as a percentage of total revenues  professional services revenues for the year ended december  were as compared to for the year ended december  this decrease in professional service revenues as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to the increase in revenues from our blackboard connect product  for which we generally do not provide professional services 
cost of product revenues 
our cost of product revenues for the year ended december  was million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of product revenues was primarily due to a million increase in expenses related to hosting services due to the increase in the number of clients contracting for new hosting services or existing clients expanding their existing hosting arrangements and a million increase in expenses incurred related to our blackboard connect product  including related telecommunications costs 
the remaining increase was primarily due to increases in our technical support expenses associated with increased headcount and personnel costs to support increases in the number of licenses held by new and existing clients  including the addition of angel s technical support groups following the merger that closed in may cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues were for the years ended december  and cost of product revenues excludes amortization of acquired technology intangibles resulting from acquisitions  which is included as amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions 
amortization expense 
table of contents related to acquired technology was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease was attributable to the completion of the amortization of acquired technology acquired in connection with our acquisition of webct in offset  in part  by amortization of acquired technology acquired following the angel merger that closed in may cost of product revenues  including amortization of acquired technology  as a percentage of product revenues was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  cost of professional services revenues 
our cost of professional services revenues for the year ended december  was million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  cost of professional services revenues as a percentage of professional services revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in professional services revenues margin was primarily attributable to an increase in professional services revenues from new professional service engagements in current and prior periods 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel related costs due to higher average headcount during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   including increased personnel related costs associated with the inclusion of angel following the angel merger that closed in may and nti following the nti merger that closed in january sales and marketing expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel related costs due to higher average headcount during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the increased headcount following the angel merger that closed in may and the nti merger that closed in january further  we incurred approximately million in additional bad debt expense during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to approximately million in acquisition and integration related expenses attributable to the angel merger that closed in may the remaining increase relates to increased personnel related costs due to higher average headcount during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the increased headcount following the angel merger that closed in may and the nti merger that closed in january patent proceeds impairment and other costs 
our operating expenses were reduced during the year ended december  due to the million payment from desirelearn in june in satisfaction of the judgment amount plus accrued interest arising from the patent litigation between us and desirelearn 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million expense related to the reversal of this judgment as the result of the outcome of an appeal by desirelearn

historically  we have performed a disproportionate amount of our professional services  the revenue from which we recognize as performed  in our second and third quarters each year 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the uneven seasonal demand for our licenses and services offerings

table of contents  we received million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options as compared to million during the year ended december  notes payable in june  we issued and sold the notes in a public offering 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year on the principal amount 
interest is payable semi annually on january and july we made interest payments of million on december  and million on each of july   december   june  and december  the notes will mature on july   subject to earlier conversion  redemption or repurchase 
the notes will be convertible  under specified circumstances  into cash or a combination of cash and our common stock at an initial base conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
the base conversion rate represents an initial base conversion price of approximately 
if at the time of conversion the applicable price of our common stock exceeds the base conversion price  the conversion rate will be increased by up to an additional shares of our common stock per  principal amount of notes  as determined pursuant to a specified formula 
in general  upon conversion of a note  the holder of such note will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and our common stock for the note s conversion value in excess of such principal amount 
the diluted earnings per share effect of the shares that would be issued will be accounted for only if the average market price of our common stock price during the period is greater than the notes conversion price 
because the notes contain an adjusting conversion rate provision based on our common stock price and anti dilution adjustment provisions  at each reporting period  we evaluate whether any adjustments to the conversion price would alter the effective conversion rate from the stated conversion rate and result in an in the money conversion 
whenever an adjustment to the conversion rate results in an increase in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes  we would recognize a beneficial conversion feature in the period such a determination is made and amortize it over the remaining life of the notes 
as of december   a beneficial conversion feature under the notes did not exist 
holders may surrender their notes for conversion at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date for the notes only under the following circumstances prior to january   with respect to any calendar quarter beginning after june   if the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than of the base conversion price per share of the notes on such last trading day  on or after january   until the close of business on the business day preceding maturity  during the five business days after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of notes for each day of that period was less than of the product of the closing price of our common stock and the then applicable conversion rate of the notes  or upon the occurrence of other events or circumstances as specifically defined in the notes 
if a make whole fundamental change  as defined in the notes  occurs prior to july   we may be required in certain circumstances to increase the applicable conversion rate for any notes converted in connection with such fundamental change by a specified number of shares of our common stock 
we may not redeem the notes prior to july  on or after july   we may redeem the notes  in whole at any time  or in part from time to time  at a redemption price  payable in cash  up to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase some or all of the notes on july   july  and july   or in the event of certain fundamental change transactions  at of the principal amount on the date of repurchase  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  payable in cash 
if such an event occurs  we would be required to pay the entire outstanding principal amount of million in cash  in addition to any other rights that the investors may have under the notes 
the notes are unsecured senior obligations and are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing such debt  and are effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and liabilities of our subsidiaries  including trade payables 

table of contents working capital needs we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and future cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products or services  the timing of enhancements to existing products and services and the timing of capital expenditures 
also  we may make investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
to the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
from time to time we may use our existing cash to repurchase shares of our common stock  outstanding indebtedness or other outstanding securities 
any such repurchases would depend on market conditions  the market price of our common stock  and management s assessment of our liquidity and cash flow needs 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  and  accordingly  there are no off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources 
obligations and commitments as of december   minimum future payments under existing notes payable and noncancelable operating leases were as follows for the years below interest on notes notes operating payable payable leases in thousands and beyond total we have categorized the notes above assuming redemption on the first possible redemption date by the holders of the notes on july  our corporate headquarters are in washington  dc where we lease approximately  square feet of space under a lease expiring in june we also lease offices in northern virginia  phoenix  arizona  lynnfield  massachusetts  los angeles  california  san francisco  california  indianapolis  indiana  amsterdam  netherlands  vancouver  canada  brno  czech republic  and sydney  australia 
seasonality our operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to the timing of client budget cycles and student attendance at client facilities 
historically  we have had lower new sales in our first and fourth quarters than in the remainder of the year 
our expenses  however  do not vary significantly with these changes and  as a result  such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
historically  we have performed a disproportionate amount of our professional services  which are recognized as performed  in our second and third quarters each year 
in addition  deferred revenues can vary on a seasonal basis for the same reasons 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the uneven seasonal demand for our licenses and services offerings 
historically  we have generated more of our operating cash flow in the second 
table of contents half of the calendar year 
this pattern may change  however  as a result of acquisitions  new market opportunities or new product introductions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest income on our cash and cash equivalents is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
for the year ended december   a ten percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest income by approximately million 
we have accounts on our foreign subsidiaries ledgers which are maintained in the respective subsidiary s local currency and remeasured into the us dollar 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar and against the currencies of other countries in which we sell products and services including the canadian dollar  euro  british pound  japanese yen  australian dollar and others 
because of such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we recognized other income of million during the year ended december  for the year ended december   a ten percentage point adverse change in these various exchange rates into the us dollar as of december  would not have had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition
