overview we operate in two business segments  biofuels and specialty enzymes 
our biofuels business segment operates through our wholly owned subsidiary  verenium biofuels corporation and jointly owned subsidiaries with bp  galaxy biofuels llc galaxy  and vercipia  and is focused on developing unique technical and operational capabilities designed to enable the production and commercialization of biofuels  in particular ethanol produced from cellulosic biomass 
we currently believe the most significant commercial opportunity for 
table of contents our biofuels business segment will be derived from the large scale commercial production of cellulosic ethanol derived from multiple non food biomass feedstocks  with our initial focus on energy canes and grasses 
our specialty enzymes segment develops high performance enzymes for use within the alternative fuels  specialty industrial processes  and animal nutrition and health markets to enable higher throughput  lower costs  and improved environmental outcomes 
we believe the most significant commercial opportunity for our specialty enzymes business segment will be derived from continued sales  and gross product margins from our existing portfolio of enzyme products 
our biofuels and specialty enzymes businesses are both supported by a research and development team with expertise in gene discovery and optimization  cell engineering  bioprocess development  biochemistry and microbiology 
over the past years  our research and development team has developed a proprietary technology platform that has enabled us to apply advancements in science to discovering and developing unique solutions in complex industrial or commercial applications 
we have dedicated substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technologies  which include capabilities for sample collection from the world s microbial populations  generation of dna libraries  screening of these libraries using ultra high throughput methods capable of analyzing more than one billion genes per day  and optimization based on our gene evolution technologies 
we have continued to shift more of our resources from technology development to commercialization efforts for our existing and future technologies and products 
while our technologies have the potential to serve many large markets  our primary areas of focus for product development are i integrated solutions for the production of advanced biofuels  such as cellulosic ethanol  and ii specialty enzymes for alternative fuels  specialty industrial processes  and animal nutrition and health 
we have current collaborations and agreements with market leaders  such as bp  bunge oils and the us department of energy  each of which complement our internal technology and product development efforts 
we have a substantial intellectual property estate comprising more than issued patents and more than pending patents as of december  we believe that we can leverage our intellectual property estate to enhance and improve our technology development and commercialization efforts across both business units while maintaining protection on key intellectual property assets 
we have incurred net losses since our inception 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and likely will continue to fluctuate substantially in the future 
we expect to incur losses into the foreseeable future as a result of any combination of one or more of the following anticipated additional investments to implement our biofuels commercialization strategy  including capital expenditures related to optimization of our demonstration facility  and capital or operating costs we may incur for land acquisition  feedstock development  and design and engineering for our first commercial plants through our joint ventures with bp  maintaining our sales and marketing infrastructure to support our specialty enzyme business  our continued investment in manufacturing facilities necessary to meet anticipated demand for our products  and continued research and development expenses for our biofuels commercialization strategy as well as the progression of internal product candidates in our specialty enzymes business 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  we believe that our historical results are not a good indicator of our future operating results 
as more fully described in the liquidity and capital resources section beginning on page  risk factors beginning on page and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this report  our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its report 
table of contents on our financial statements related to the substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern 
we believe that we will be successful in raising or generating additional cash through a combination of corporate partnerships and collaborations  federal  state and local grant funding  selling or financing assets  incremental product sales and the additional sale of equity or debt securities  however  if we are unable to raise additional capital from any of these sources  we will need to defer  reduce or eliminate certain planned expenditures  restructure or significantly curtail our operations  file for bankruptcy or cease operations 
recent strategic events  financing transactions  and capital requirements extension of bp collaboration on february   we announced the extension of the initial month joint development program established in august with our partner bp  which was scheduled to expire on february   until march  we received an additional million from bp to co fund various scientific and technical initiatives for the month of february further  on march   we announced a second one month extension through april   for which an additional million was funded by bp for the additional month 
we and bp are continuing negotiations regarding the terms for advancing our cellulosic ethanol technology 
completion of syngenta research collaboration on october   we entered into an agreement with syngenta in connection with the completion of previously defined programs under our joint research collaboration 
we have executed an agreement whereby we gained additional exclusive rights to an array of proprietary biomolecules expressed microbially  as well as non exclusive rights to the same biomolecules expressed through non plant means such as algae 
as a result of this transaction  we obtained broad rights to several late stage enzyme development candidates 
public offering of common stock and warrants on october   we issued  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price of per unit 
each unit consists of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase of a share of common stock 
the shares of common stock and warrants are immediately separable and issued separately 
the warrants have a five year term and an exercise price of 
net proceeds after underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses  were approximately million 
notes on september  and september   we completed privately negotiated exchanges with certain existing holders of our notes 
pursuant to the exchange agreements  certain existing holders of the notes agreed to exchange million in aggregate principal for the notes  for million in aggregate principal amount of notes 
the notes are secured by a first priority lien subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens on certain of our assets including  present and future receivables  inventory  general intangibles  equipment  investment property  stock of subsidiaries  and certain other assets and proceeds relating thereto 
the collateral securing notes is subject to certain carve outs  cash and cash equivalents and intellectual property 
as part of the notes issuance  the notes were also secured by the first priority lien the notes bear interest at per year  payable in cash semi annually  and commencing on october   are convertible at the option of the holders any time prior to maturity  redemption or repurchase into shares 
table of contents of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  which represents a conversion price of per share  provided that upon conversion the holders make certain certifications 
a holder that surrenders notes for conversion in connection with a make whole fundamental change that occurs before april  may in certain circumstances be entitled to an increased conversion rate 
in no event will the conversion price of the notes be less than the per share 
the total common shares that would be issued assuming conversion of the entire million in notes is million shares  excluding common shares to be issued for potential make whole payments 
notes amendment on july   we entered into amendment agreements of our notes to modify certain terms of the notes 
the amendments became effective on july  pursuant to the terms of the notes  the notes may be amended and restated with the written consent of the holders representing at least of the notes outstanding 
as of july   there was approximately million aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding 
we entered into the amendment agreements with all but one of the noteholders  which include the holders of approximately million or of the notes 
the amendment agreements provide for the following lowering the conversion price from to  lowering the price at which the notes are subject to automatic conversion at the company s option and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions from to  clarifications for the provisions that provide for interest and make whole payments to be made in shares of our common stock  subject to certain restrictions  modification of the anti dilution protections from full ratchet to  in most cases  a version of broad based weighted average  subject to certain limitations  and modification of certain covenants intended to provide us with greater flexibility to engage in certain financing and other strategic transactions  including the ability to incur indebtedness or liens  engage in restructuring transactions involving our notes and engage in certain asset sales  and a relinquishment by the holders of the notes who signed amendment agreements of certain rights and potential rights related to conversions of notes and payments made by us with respect thereto prior to july  in connection with the notes exchange described above  we agreed to grant equal and ratable security interests in the collateral securing the notes to the holders of the notes 
as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  one holder of notes is a party to a pending lawsuit against us  whereby that holder also seeks declaratory judgment that its notes may not be amended by the required holders without that holder s consent 
years ended december  and selected segment financial data our business consists of two business units  which we refer to as our biofuels segment and our specialty enzymes segment 
the biofuels segment is focused on developing unique technical and operational capabilities designed to enable the production and commercialization of biofuels  in particular ethanol from cellulosic biomass 
the specialty enzymes segment develops high performance enzymes for use within the alternative fuels  specialty industrial processes  and animal nutrition and health markets to enable higher throughput  lower costs  and improved environmental outcomes 

table of contents we assess performance and allocate resources based on discrete financial information for the biofuels and specialty enzymes segments 
for the biofuels segment  performance is assessed based on total operating expenses and capital expenditures 
for the specialty enzymes segment performance is assessed based on total revenues  product revenues  product gross profit  total operating expenses and capital expenditures 
for the years ended december  and  the specialty enzyme segment comprised of our product revenue and cost of product revenue 
our operating expenses for each segment include direct and allocated research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
in management s evaluation of performance  certain corporate operating expenses are excluded from the business segments such as non cash share based compensation  restructuring charges  severance  depreciation and amortization  and other corporate expenses  which are not allocated to either business segment 
in addition  we evaluate segment performance based upon capital expenditures and other assets that are specifically identified to the business segment  excluding certain corporate assets such as cash  short term investments  and other assets that can be attributed to  or utilized by  both business segments 
expenses and assets shared by the segments require the use of judgments and estimates in determining the allocation of expenses to the two segments 
different assumptions or allocation methods could result in materially different results by segment 
further  expenses allocated to each of the two segments may not be indicative of the expenses of each operating segment if such segments operated on a stand alone basis 
selected operating results for the year ended december  and for each of our business segments is set forth below in thousands biofuels specialty enzymes corporate total biofuels specialty enzymes corporate total product revenue collaborative and grant revenue total revenues product gross profit operating expenses excluding cost of goods sold total operating income loss loss attributed to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities operating income loss attributed to verenium capital expenditures corporate operating expenses include approximately million in a non cash goodwill impairment charge in 
table of contents identifiable assets by operating segment are set forth below in thousands as of december  biofuels specialty enzymes corporate total property  plant and equipment  net cash and other assets total identifiable assets as of december   biofuels cash and other assets includes million of vercipia cash and cash equivalents which is limited for use in vercipia operations 
as of december  biofuels specialty enzymes corporate total property  plant and equipment  net cash and other assets total identifiable assets consolidated results of operations revenues revenues for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands change revenues phyzyme phytase all other products total product grant collaborative total revenues revenues decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to december  for the year ended december   our revenue mix continued to shift to a larger percentage of product and grant revenues  consistent with our strategy to grow product sales and biofuels projects  and de emphasize collaborations that are not core to our strategic market focus 
product and grant revenues represented of total revenues for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  product revenues decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this decrease is attributed primarily to the following factors while gross shipments of phyzyme for the year ended december  remained at levels comparable to  our reported net phyzyme revenue was lower than our reported net revenue in the same periods of the prior year 
this is attributed to a larger percentage of phyzyme sales manufactured by genencor  a subsidiary of danisco  for which we recognize only the royalty component on operating profit for phyzyme sales 
due to capacity constraints during late  we contracted with genencor to serve as a second source manufacturer of phyzyme 
we recognize revenue from phyzyme that is manufactured by genencor in an amount equal to the royalty on operating profit we receive from 
table of contents danisco  as compared to the full value of the manufacturing costs plus royalty on operating profit we recognize for phyzyme we manufacture at fermic 
we discontinued two of our product lines  bayovac srs and quantum  during early the decrease in phyzyme product revenue was offset in part by an increase in sales of our fuelzyme and xylathin enzymes  which continued to gain acceptance in the grain ethanol markets  and our veretase enzyme for the potable ethanol market 
revenues from phyzyme represented approximately of total product revenues for the year ended december  and we expect that phyzyme will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total product revenues in the foreseeable future 
given the worldwide recession  we cannot be certain that demand for our enzyme products and resulting sales will meet expectations 
in particular following a year of substantial growth in revenues and related market share of our phyzyme enzyme in  we and our partner danisco  saw a softening in the phytase animal feed market attributed to a recessionary decline in consumer consumption of protein and financial distress in the poultry industry  which negatively impacted demand for feed and thus our enzyme  particularly during the first half of nevertheless  phyzyme sales strengthened in late  as demand for poultry began to recover with economic conditions 
demand for fuelzyme was significantly impacted by challenges in the corn ethanol industry  which experienced significant distress in due to high corn prices and low ethanol prices 
during the first half of  there were several well publicized bankruptcies  including two of the largest producers of corn ethanol in the us operating rates in the industry were significantly reduced  which negatively impacted demand for enzymes in the first half of recently  we have begun to see ethanol plant operating rates return to pre levels  and some idle capacity has been brought back on line  signaling a recovery in the corn ethanol industry over the latter part of a primary market for purifine  used for soybean oil processing  is latin america  which has suffered drought  political upheaval over taxes on agriculatural exports  and overall challenging market conditions since early as a result  adoption of purifine in the region has been delayed  thus purifine revenue was below expectations for though we anticipate a ramp up in purifine revenues  it has been slower than initially expected 
however  purifine has gained strong commercial traction during in addition to continued demand from bunge  or primary customer for purifine  we recently signed a long term contract with molinos  operator of the world s largest soybean processing plant in argentina  to implement the commercial scale oil degumming process using purifine 
grant revenue increased million  to million for the year ended december  compared to the increase in grant revenue was primarily attributable to various new grants awarded during late and throughout from the department of energy to further optimize our demonstration scale facility 
we continue to pursue additional opportunities to secure federal  state or local agency funding to support our biofuels initiatives 
as of december   we have committed funding from various governmental agencies totaling million through  and expect to continue to see a decrease in grant revenue during as compared to collaborative revenue decreased million  to million for the year ended december  we have continued to de emphasize collaborations that are not core to our current focus in favor of greater emphasis 
table of contents on sales of products and biofuels projects 
we anticipate that collaborative revenue will continue to represent a small component of our revenue in  due in large part to this de emphasis of non strategic collaborations and decrease in revenue related to wind down of projects with existing strategic collaborators  such as our settlement agreement with syngenta 
on october   we completed previously defined programs under our joint research collaboration with syngenta 
in connection with the completion of those programs  the parties have executed an agreement whereby we gained additional exclusive rights to an array of proprietary biomolecules expressed microbially  as well as non exclusive rights to the same biomolecules expressed through non plant means such as algae  further bolstering our specialty enzymes product pipeline 
we will continue to pursue opportunities to expand  renew  or enter into new collaborations that we believe fit our strategic focus and represent product commercialization opportunities in the future  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in renewing or expanding existing collaborations  or securing new collaboration partners 
our revenues have historically fluctuated from period to period and likely will continue to fluctuate substantially in the future based upon the adoption rates of our new and existing commercial products  timing and composition of funding under existing and future collaboration agreements  timing and amount of funding under government grants  as well as regulatory approval timelines for new products 
we anticipate that our revenue mix will continue to shift toward a higher percentage of product and grant revenue 
product gross profit margin product gross profit for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands change product revenue cost of product revenue product gross profit product gross margin cost of product revenue includes both fixed and variable costs  including materials and supplies  labor  facilities  royalties and other overhead costs  associated with our product revenues 
excluded from cost of product revenue are costs associated with the scale up of manufacturing processes for new products that have not reached commercial scale production volumes  which we include in our research and development expenses 
cost of product revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from the change in production for our phyzyme product revenue and related cost manufactured by genencor as described below  combined with inventory losses and additional freight costs incurred in as further described below 
we manufacture most of our enzyme products through a manufacturing facility in mexico city  owned by fermic sa  or fermic 
we also have contracted with genencor  a subsidiary of danisco  to serve as a second source manufacturer of phyzyme 
as discussed above  we recognize revenue from phyzyme that is manufactured by genencor in an amount equal to the royalty received from danisco  as compared to the full value of the manufacturing costs plus the royalty on operating profit we currently recognize for phyzyme we manufacture at fermic 
while this revenue recognition treatment has little or no negative impact on the gross margin in absolute dollars we recognize for every sale of phyzyme  it does have a negative impact on the gross product revenue we recognize for phyzyme as the volume of phyzyme manufactured by genencor increases 

table of contents product gross margin totaled million  or of product revenue for the year ended december  compared to million  or of product revenue for the year ended december  gross margin percentage improvement for the year ended december  reflects various factors  specifically due to our manufacturing arrangement with genencor to serve as a second source manufacturer for phyzyme as previously described  we record revenue and costs related to phyzyme that genencor manufactures on a net basis versus a gross basis 
this had no impact on the absolute value of our gross margin  but resulted in an increase to the gross margin percentage reported for the year ended december  during the year ended december   gross margin percentage was lower due to i inventory losses related to contamination issues in our phyzyme enzyme manufacturing process  and ii incremental zero margin freight revenue and related costs incurred to meet customer ship dates 
both of these factors negatively impacted gross profit and resulted in a lower gross margin in during  we experienced a favorable product mix shift to products with lower production costs  such as fuelzyme 
for the reasons described above  we believe that product gross margin dollars is a better indication of performance than product gross margin percentage 
because a large percentage of our manufacturing costs are fixed  our gross margin may be negatively impacted in the future if our product revenues decrease or if they do not grow in line with our increase in minimum capacity requirements at fermic 
our gross margins are also dependent upon the mix of product related sales as the cost of product related revenue varies from product to product 
in addition  because phyzyme represents a significant percentage of our product revenue  our product gross margin is impacted to a great degree by the gross margin achieved on sales of phyzyme 
under our manufacturing and sales agreement with danisco  we sell our phyzyme inventory to danisco at our cost and then  under a license agreement  share of danisco s profit  as defined  when the product is sold to danisco s customer 
as a result  our total cost of product revenue for phyzyme is incurred as we ship product to danisco  and the royalty on operating profit is recognized in the period in which the product is sold to danisco s customer as reported to us by danisco 
we may record our quarterly royalty on operating profit based on estimates from danisco  and the final calculation of profit share is sometimes finalized in the subsequent quarter  accordingly  we are subject to potential adjustments to our actual royalty on operating profit from quarter to quarter 
these adjustments  while typically considered immaterial in absolute dollars  could have a significant impact on our reported product gross margin from quarter to quarter 
in addition  our supply agreement with danisco for phyzyme contains provisions which allow danisco  with six months advance notice  to assume manufacturing rights for phyzyme 
if danisco decides to exercise this right  we may experience excess capacity at fermic 
if we are unable to absorb this excess capacity with other products in the event that danisco assumes all or a portion of phyzyme manufacturing rights  this may have a negative impact on our revenues and our product gross margin 
operating expenses research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands change research and development selling  general and administrative expenses 
table of contents our operating expenses excluding cost of product revenue for the year ended december  decreased due to decreased research and development efforts associated with specialty enzyme projects offset by increases in expenses related to our demonstration scale facility optimization efforts  further offset by cost minimization efforts during research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with internal development of our technologies and our product candidates  including engineering costs associated with our pilot and demonstration scale cellulosic ethanol facilities  manufacturing scale up and bioprocess development for our current products  and costs associated with research activities performed on behalf of our collaborators 
for the year ended december   we estimate that approximately of our research and development personnel costs  based upon hours incurred  were spent on unfunded product and technology development  and that approximately were spent on research activities funded in whole or in part by our partners 
for the year ended december   we estimate that approximately of our research and development personnel costs  based upon hours incurred  were spent on unfunded product and technology development  and that approximately were spent on research activities funded by our collaborations and grants 
the increase in percentage of time spent on funded product and technology development from the prior year is primarily attributed to our focus on cellulosic ethanol process development  which is partially funded by federal grants and bp through our galaxy joint venture 
we have a limited history of developing commercial products and technologies 
we determine which products and technologies to pursue independently based on various criteria  including investment required  estimated time to market  regulatory hurdles  infrastructure requirements  and industry specific expertise necessary for successful commercialization 
successful products and technologies require significant development and investment prior to regulatory approval and commercialization 
as a result of the significant risks and uncertainties involved in developing and commercializing such products  we are unable to estimate the nature  timing  and cost of the efforts necessary to complete each of our major projects 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following our products and technologies may require more resources than we anticipate if we are technically unsuccessful in initial development or commercialization efforts  the outcome of research is unknown until each stage of testing is completed  up through and including trials and regulatory approvals  if needed  it can take many years from the initial decision to perform research through development until products and technologies  if any  are ultimately marketed  we have product candidates and technologies in various stages of development related to collaborations and grants as well as internally developed products and technologies 
at any time  we may modify our strategy and pursue additional collaborations for the development and commercialization of some products and technologies that we had intended to pursue independently 
for example  in we entered into a joint collaboration with bp to co fund the advancement and validation of our cellulosic ethanol process technology  which had previously been largely self funded  and funding for existing products or projects may not be available on commercially acceptable terms  or at all  which may cause us to defer or reduce our product development efforts 
any one of these risks and uncertainties could have a significant impact on the nature  timing  and costs to complete our product and technology development efforts 
accordingly  we are unable to predict which potential commercialization candidates we may proceed with  the time and costs to complete development  and ultimately 
table of contents whether we will have any products or technologies approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies 
the various risks associated with our research and development activities are discussed more fully in this report under risk factors 
our research and development expenses increased million  to million including share based compensation of million compared to million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december  our research and development expenses by operating segment for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands change biofuels specialty enzymes biofuels research and development research and development expenses related to our biofuels business include costs related to our ongoing development and validation of our cellulosic ethanol process technology  including  but not limited to  enzyme discovery and development and bioprocess development designed to improve ethanol yields and reduce cost per gallon  feedstock testing and validation at the laboratory  pilot and demonstration plant scale  as well as costs related to commissioning  optimization and operation of our demonstration scale facility in jennings  louisiana 
during  costs related to our ligno cellulosic enzyme development programs which were partially funded by syngenta  were included in specialty enzymes research and development 
in  we have categorized these costs in our biofuels segment 
our biofuels research and development expenses increased million for the year ended december  from million in this increase relates primarily to million in depreciation expense for our demonstration scale facility which was placed in service in february  the acceleration of our biofuels technology development efforts during and  particularly related to our demonstration scale facility commissioning and optimization at our site in jennings  louisiana  which bp has substantially funded through our galaxy joint venture  as well as our commercialization efforts through the vercipia entity 
as described in more detail below  our gross research and development costs related to galaxy and vercipia are included in research and development on our consolidated statements of operations  with bp s cost reimbursement to us included in loss attributed to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 
we consider our current cellulosic ethanol technology under development to be our generation or gen technology 
to date  we have demonstrated that our gen technology can produce cellulosic ethanol at a small scale in the laboratory  pilot plant  and demonstration scale facility  but at yields and cost that are not yet commercially viable 
we will require continued and substantial investment to further develop our gen technology  and continue to believe that gen will produce a viable technology that could be deployed on a commercial scale as early as we anticipate that we could break ground on our first commercial plant as early as specialty enzymes research and development research and development expenses related to our specialty enzyme business include costs related to ongoing bioprocess development and manufacturing process yield improvements  funded support for research collaborations and to a lesser extent  early stage product development 
due to limited capital resources and challenging economic conditions  we are not spending significant resources on early stage specialty enzyme product development without additional investment from strategic partners 

table of contents our specialty enzymes research and development expenses decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the comparable period in this decrease is related primarily to our shift in focus to biofuels process development and  to a lesser extent  the de emphasis of early stage product development for our specialty enzyme business segment and collaboration and grant work not core to our current focus 
selling  general and administrative expenses change selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december  excluding the impact of share based compensation  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the decrease during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to the decrease in consulting and advisory expenses related to the first phase of our collaboration with bp  galaxy  in august  partially offset by the biofuels commercial development efforts for our first commercial plant  which bp partially funds through our vercipia joint venture  and cost minimization efforts in share based compensation charges we recognized million  or per share  and million  or per share  for the years ended december  and share based compensation expense was allocated among the following expense categories in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative share based compensation decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily related to the suspension of our employee stock purchase plan during the first quarter of and an overall decrease in equity awards granted since our merger with celunol corp in  partially offset by the tender offer option exchange which resulted in approximately million in additional expense during the year 
goodwill impairment during  we determined that the market value of our common stock and convertible debt was not adequate to support the carrying value of our goodwill resulting from the june merger between diversa and celunol 
as a result  pursuant to authoritative accounting guidance we recorded a non cash charge of million in  representing full impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill 
we believe that this impairment was reflective primarily of current market conditions  and was not indicative of a change in our business or implied value of our underlying biofuels business model aimed toward the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol 
interest and other income  net interest income on cash and short term investments was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to lower average cash and investment balances during 
table of contents interest expense interest expense was million  net of in capitalized interest for the demonstration scale facility  for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   net of million in capitalized interest for the demonstration facility 
our demonstration scale facility was placed in service in february  and as such  we ceased capitalizing interest on that date 
the increase in interest expense from the comparable periods in was primarily attributed to the decrease in capitalized interest partially offset by the decrease in notes principal outstanding from conversions 
total interest expense for the years ended december  and comprised of the following in thousands coupon interest  payable in cash non cash amortization of debt issuance costs notes total coupon interest  payable in cash or common stock non cash accretion of debt discount non cash amortization of debt issuance costs notes total coupon interest  payable in cash or common stock non cash amortization of debt premium notes total equipment financing other capitalized interest total interest expense gain on contract settlement on october   we entered into an agreement with syngenta in connection with the completion of previously defined programs under our joint research collaboration 
as of the separation date  approximately million in deferred revenue was outstanding related to syngenta for unearned  prepaid research funding under the previous agreement 
the million was recognized as gain on contract settlement for the year ended december   as the amount represented cash received in excess of research labor hours incurred  for which we had not completed the revenue earning process 
loss on exchange of convertible notes in connection with the issuance of the notes  we exchanged million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes 
pursuant to current accounting rules  we recorded a non cash loss on the exchange of million  equal to the difference between the carrying value of the notes and the fair value of the notes and warrants issued 
gain on amendment of notes in connection with the amendment of the notes  the notes conversion price was reduced from to and the anti dilution protection included in the notes was changed from full ratchet anti dilution protection to  in most cases  a version of broad based weighted average anti dilution protection  subject to certain limitations 
pursuant to authoritative guidance  we determined that the amendment qualified as a liability extinguishment  and recorded a gain on the amendment of million  equal to the difference between the fair value of the notes compound embedded derivative before and after the amendment

gain loss on debt extinguishment upon conversion of convertible debt during the year ended december   we recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of million compared to a loss of million for the year ended decembre  the gain loss calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the converted notes and the fair value of the shares of common stock delivered to the noteholders upon conversion 
the carrying value of the converted notes for the year ended december  was equal to the million of principal less the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs  which totaled million  as of the conversion date 
during the year ended december   we issued a total of million shares with a total market value as of the dates of conversion of million to settle the notes and make whole payments

loss attributed to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities in connection with the initial phase of our strategic partnership with bp  we formed galaxy as a special purpose entity 
we are considered the primary beneficiary of galaxy and consolidate its financial results 
pursuant to current accounting rules  the transaction fees and joint development fees are accounted for as follows the license to technology we granted to galaxy and ongoing joint development work we perform for galaxy are accounted for as capital contributions to galaxy  transaction fees and joint development fees paid by bp are accounted for as capital contributions to galaxy  which are subsequently distributed to us as a reduction to our capital account  ongoing joint development fees are accounted for as a monthly expense of galaxy 
in connection with the second phase of our strategic partnership with bp  we hold a interest in vercipia  a special purpose entity 
we are considered the primary beneficiary of vercipia and consolidate its financial results 
pursuant to current accounting rules  the ongoing joint development is considered a monthly expense of vercipia 
all contributions are contributed directly into vercipia 
as a result  our consolidated financial statements include a line item called noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 
on our consolidated balance sheets  this line reflects bp s ownership of galaxy s and vercipia s equity 
this line item is reduced by bp s share of galaxy s and vercipia s losses  and increased by cash contributions made by bp 
bp s share of losses is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as loss attributed to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 
galaxy and vercipia have incurred losses through december   of which have been allocated to bp  and we anticipate these entities will continue to incur losses related to ongoing joint development through at least the initial joint development program and construction processes

for the year ended december   our revenue mix shifted to a larger percentage of product revenue  consistent with our strategy to grow product sales and de emphasize collaborations that are not core to our strategic market focus 
product revenue represented of total revenues for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  product revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to increased revenue and royalty associated with phyzyme xp phytase sold through our collaboration with danisco 
the increase in phyzyme revenue was primarily related to the following factors in late  the eu commission granted permanent authorization for the use of phyzyme xp in broiler poultry feed in europe which has expanded the end user market for phyzyme xp  in late  danisco introduced a new dry  pelletized  and thermally stable formulation of phyzyme xp  and beginning in late  due to an increase in the cost of phosphates an animal feed additive  sales volumes of phyzyme xp to danisco s current customers have been positively impacted  as many of these customers have increased phyzyme dosages as a replacement for higher cost phosphates 
non phyzyme related product revenue increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to increased sales of our fuelzyme lf and purifine products 
this increase was offset by the discontinuation of our bayovac srs and quantum products 
product revenue for the year ended december  includes million of revenue from sales of these products during the first six months of fiscal these products were discontinued due to the following in late  because of new entrants into the vaccine market and resulting pressure on pricing and margins  we made the strategic decision to exit the animal health vaccine market to focus on product 
table of contents commercialization efforts in areas that are more strategic to our current focus  namely biofuels 
in connection with this decision  we terminated our licensing and collaboration agreement with microtek  and discontinued sales of bayovac srs after march   and in february  ab enzymes and ab vista collectively  ab  both subsidiaries of associated british foods plc  announced the acquisition of syngenta s quantum phytase feed enzyme business 
prior to this transaction  we supplied quantum phytase to syngenta pursuant to a manufacturing and supply agreement 
we were unable to reach a manufacturing and supply agreement with ab on commercially agreeable terms 
revenue from phyzyme represented approximately of total product revenue for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  collaborative revenue decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  collaborative revenue accounted for of total revenue for the year ended december  as compared to of total revenue for the year ended december  we have continued to de emphasize collaborations that are not core to our current focus in favor of greater emphasis on sales of products 
grant revenue increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  the increase in grant revenue was primarily attributable to a grant awarded in the fourth quarter from the department of energy to discover and develop new enzymes and enzyme cocktails to break down various types of biomass 
we continue to pursue additional opportunities to secure federal  state or local agency funding to support our biofuels initiatives 
as of december   we had committed funding from various governmental agencies totaling million through product gross profit gross margin product gross profit and product gross margin for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands change product revenue cost of product revenue product gross profit product gross margin product gross profit totaled million  or of product revenue  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of product revenue  for the year ended december  gross profit and margin improvement is reflective of higher sales volumes to absorb our fixed costs  partially offset by lower than anticipated manufacturing yields for phyzyme and  to a lesser extent  incremental zero margin freight revenue incurred during the first half of to meet customer ship dates which negatively impacted gross profit margin by approximately one percentage point during the year ended december  our product gross margins in were below our target of  primarily due to manufacturing variances related to unfavorable yields and higher raw material prices 
over time  our gross margins should be positively impacted by continued growth in sales of our enzyme products  as well as cost efficiencies we would expect to achieve if we continue to scale up production and improve our manufacturing yields 
because a large percentage of our manufacturing costs are fixed  we should realize continued margin improvements as product revenues increase  however  our margins may be negatively impacted in the future if our product revenues do not grow in line with our increase in minimum capacity requirements at fermic 

table of contents because phyzyme represents a significant percentage of our product revenue  our product gross margin is impacted to a great degree by the gross margin achieved on sales of phyzyme 
under our agreement with danisco  we sell our phyzyme inventory to danisco at our cost and then receive a royalty on danisco s operating profit  as defined  when the product is sold to the end user 
as a result  our total cost of product revenue for phyzyme is incurred as we ship product to danisco  and royalty on operating profit is recognized in the period in which the product is sold to the end user as reported to us by danisco 
we may record our quarterly royalty on operating profit based on estimates from danisco  and the final calculation royalty on operating profit is sometimes finalized in the subsequent quarter  accordingly  we are subject to potential adjustments to our actual royalty on operating profit from quarter to quarter 
these adjustments  while typically considered immaterial in absolute dollars  could have a significant impact on our reported product gross margin from quarter to quarter 
our product gross margin is dependent upon the mix of product sales as the cost of product revenue varies from product to product 
we believe that our product gross margin should be positively impacted as we grow sales of products we market and sell directly to end users  namely fuelzyme lf and purifine  which are expected to have higher gross margins than our phyzyme products 
cost of product revenue includes both fixed and variable costs  including materials and supplies  labor  facilities and other overhead costs  associated with our product revenues 
excluded from cost of product revenue are costs associated with the scale up of manufacturing processes for new products that have not reached commercial scale production volumes  which we include in our research and development expenses 
cost of product revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the increase in product revenues  and to a lesser extent  the increase in our fixed manufacturing costs under our contract with fermic 
operating expenses research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands change research and development selling  general and administrative expenses the operating expenses for the year ended december  increased compared to the prior year ended december   related primarily to the biofuels business only being included in operating expenses since the closing of the june merger with celunol  as well as our acceleration of biofuels development and commercialization efforts in research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with internal development of our technologies and our product candidates  including engineering costs associated with our pilot and demonstration scale cellulosic ethanol facilities  manufacturing scale up and bioprocess development for our current products  and costs associated with research activities performed on behalf of our collaborators 
for the year ended december  we estimate that approximately of our research and development personnel costs  based upon hours incurred  were spent on internal product and technology development  and that approximately on research activities funded by our collaborators and grants 
for the year ended december  we estimate that approximately of our research and development personnel costs  based upon hours incurred  were spent on internal product and technology development  and that approximately on research activities funded by our collaborators and grants 
the increase in time spent on internal product and technology development from the prior year is primarily attributed to our focus on cellulosic ethanol process development since the merger with celunol  and to a lesser extent  bioprocess development and technical support for our enzyme products that have already been introduced commercially 

table of contents our research and development expenses increased million  to million including share based compensation of million compared to million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december  our research and development expenses by operating segment for the years ended december  and were as follow in thousands change biofuels specialty enzymes biofuels research and development research and development expenses related to our biofuels business include cost related to our ongoing development and validation of our cellulosic ethanol process technology  including  but not limited to  enzyme discovery and development and bioprocess development designed to improve ethanol yields and reduce cost per gallon  feedstock testing and validation at the laboratory  pilot and demo plant scale  as well as costs related to commissioning  optimization and operation of our demo plant in jennings  louisiana 
our biofuels research and development expenses increased million from to this increase is related to two factors 
first  our expenses include a full twelve months of post merger biofuels related expenses  while in our expenses included only about six months of post merger expenses 
second  we accelerated our biofuels technology development efforts during  particularly related to our demo plant start up and commissioning at our site in jennings  louisiana 
specialty enzymes research and development research and development expenses related to our specialty enzyme business include costs related to ongoing bioprocess development and manufacturing process yield improvements  funded support for research collaborations and to a lesser extent  early stage product development 
our specialty enzymes research and development expenses decreased million from to this decrease is related primarily to our shift in focus to biofuels process development after the merger with celunol on june   and to a lesser extent the de emphasis of early stage product development for our specialty enzyme business segment and collaboration and grant work not core to our current focus 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december  this increase is largely due to incremental personnel and overhead costs resulting from the merger with celunol in june  incremental legal expense  consulting and advisory expenses related to the first phase of our collaboration with bp  and  to a lesser extent  increased personnel costs and professional services costs to support the growth in product sales and increased complexity of our business 
these increases were partially offset by charges incurred during of million related to severance  bonus and modifications to equity awards pursuant to transitional employment and severance agreements with certain executives after the completion of the merger with celunol in june 
table of contents share based compensation charges we recognized million  or per share  and million  or per share  for the years ended december  and these charges had no impact on our reported cash flows 
share based compensation expense was allocated among the following expense categories in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative share based compensation increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily related to additional grants related to new hires during included in share based compensation for the year ended december  are non recurring charges of million related to modification of vesting for restricted stock awards for certain executives in connection with separation agreements relating to the merger with celunol 
goodwill impairment during  we determined that the market value of our common stock and convertible debt was not adequate to support the carrying value of our goodwill resulting from the june merger between diversa and celunol 
we recorded a non cash charge of million during the quarter ended september   representing full impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill 
we believe that this impairment is reflective primarily of current market conditions  and is not indicative of a change in our business or implied value of our underlying biofuels business model aimed toward the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol 
acquired in process research and development we allocated million of the purchase price in connection with our merger with celunol in june to acquired in process research and development projects 
acquired in process research and development ipr d represents the valuation of acquired  to be completed research projects 
celunol s ongoing research and development initiatives have primarily involved the development of its patented and proprietary biotechnology to enable production of fuel grade ethanol from cellulosic biomass materials 
as of the merger date  pursuant to authoritative guidance under these projects were not determined to have reached technological feasibility and determined to have no alternative future use 
accordingly  the amounts allocated to those projects were written off in the second quarter of  the period the merger was consummated 
restructuring charges we recorded charges of million during the year ended december  in connection with our strategic reorganization in january  which included costs for employee separation and estimates for facilities consolidation costs 
during the years ended december  and december   we recorded million and million of additional charges reflecting revisions in our estimates and present value adjustments for our remaining net facilities consolidation costs 
our revision in december was primarily related to executing our sublease agreement with a subtenant in october all expense amounts are included within selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest and other income  net interest income on cash and short term investments was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to lower average cash and investment balances during

loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in galaxy biofuels llc in connection with the initial phase of our strategic partnership with bp  we formed galaxy as a special purpose entity 
we are considered the primary beneficiary of galaxy and consolidate its financial results 
pursuant to current accounting rules  the transaction fees and joint development fees are accounted for as follows the license to technology we granted to galaxy and ongoing joint development work we perform for galaxy are considered capital contributions to galaxy  transaction fees and joint development fees paid by bp are considered capital contributions to galaxy  which are subsequently distributed to us as a reduction to our capital account  
table of contents ongoing joint development is considered a monthly expense of galaxy 
as a result  our consolidated financial statements include a line item called noncontrolling interest in galaxy biofuels llc 
on our consolidated balance sheet  this line reflects bp s ownership of galaxy s equity 
this line item is reduced by bp s share of galaxy s profits and losses  and increased by cash distributions made by bp to us on behalf of galaxy 
bp s share of galaxy s losses is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations as loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in galaxy biofuels llc 
galaxy has incurred approximately million in losses through december   of which have been allocated to bp 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our business primarily through the sale of common and preferred stock  funding from strategic partners and government grants  the issuance of convertible debt  and product sales 
as of december  our strategic partners  including bp  have provided us with more than million in funding since inception  including more than million from various government agencies  and are committed to additional funding of more than million through  subject to our performance under existing agreements  excluding milestone payments  license and commercialization fees  and royalties or profit sharing 
our committed funding includes million from our vercipia joint venture with bp  announced in february  which is to be paid during the first quarter of vercipia operates as a separate commercial entity  with the million in committed bp funding used solely for this entity 
our future committed funding is subject to our performance under existing agreements  and is concentrated within a limited number of collaborators 
our failure to successfully maintain our relationships with these collaborators could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
capital requirements as of december   we had available cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  including approximately million which relates to vercipia and is to be used solely for its operations 
historically  we have funded our capital requirements through available cash  issuances of debt and equity  product  collaboration and grant revenue  capital leases and equipment financing  and line of credit agreements 
since march  we have raised approximately million in net cash proceeds from convertible debt issuances to fund our cellulosic ethanol pilot and demonstration scale facilities and other working capital requirements  and in october we raised approximately million in net cash proceeds from an underwritten public offering of shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we will require additional capital to fund our operations 
our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements related to the substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern 
our cash at december   along with anticipated cash from grants  revenue  our commitment from bp and other sources is not sufficient to meet cash requirements to fund our operating expenses  capital expenditures  required and potential payments under our notes  notes and notes  and working capital requirements through without additional sources of cash and or the deferral  reduction or elimination of significant planned expenditures 
we are dependent upon bp s financial and technical contributions to our joint ventures in order to realize the benefits of the strategic partnership with bp 
the efforts under the first phase of our partnership have been co funded by bp under an month initial agreement was scheduled to expire on january  and was extended through march  and then again recently to april  we and bp are currently in discussions to extend this partnership 
if bp were to discontinue its participation  we would need to continue the efforts on our own or identify and enter into arrangements with one or more other partners 
if we were required to fund all 
table of contents of the technology development efforts contemplated under this partnership  we would need to raise additional funds to do so  which may be difficult in the current financing environment 
alternatively  it may be difficult for us to find a different partner that is a good strategic fit and to enter into a new strategic relationship on terms that are favorable to us 
if we are unable to find an additional partner or raise additional funds  we may be required to discontinue our biofuels business or dispose of certain assets related to it 
through our vercipia joint venture with bp  we will also need to raise sufficient capital to fund the construction of our first commercial cellulosic ethanol plant to be located in highlands county  florida 
we estimate that the total costs of construction for this first commercial plant will be approximately million  which we anticipate will be funded from a combination of non recourse debt and equity capital 
in february  we and bp filed a joint application for a department of energy doe loan guarantee program 
on june   we announced our application had been selected by the doe to enter the due diligence phase of its title xvii loan guarantee program 
if awarded  funding from this program could cover a substantial portion of the total cost of construction of the project we expect the remaining portion to be funded by project equity investments from bp and us 
this may require us to raise project financing in addition to the cash required to fund our ongoing operations 
pending the timing of project financining  we anticpate that vercipia could break ground on this facility as early as we believe that we will be successful in generating additional cash to fund our operations through a combination of additional corporate partnerships and collaborations  federal  state and local grant funding  incremental product sales  selling or financing assets  and  if necessary and available  the sale of equity or debt securities 
if we are unsuccessful in raising additional capital from any of these sources  we will need to defer  reduce or eliminate certain planned expenditures 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any sources of financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are not able to defer  reduce or eliminate our expenditures  secure additional sources of revenue or otherwise secure additional funding  we may need to restructure or significantly curtail our operations  divest all or a portion of our business  file for bankruptcy or cease operations

our consolidated liabilities have decreased by million  to million at december  from million at december   primarily attributable to a decrease in our carrying value of debt  due to additional conversions of the notes during  which resulted in the issuance of million shares of our common stock 
cash flows related to operating  investing and financing activities our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december  our cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of cash used to fund our efforts in cellulosic ethanol technology process development and commercialization  which was partially offset by proceeds from bp s capital contributions to galaxy and vercipia which are included in financing activities described below 
our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december  our investing activities included purchases of property  plant and equipment primarily for the start up and commissioning of our demonstration scale facility

in  we achieved a key development milestone when our demonstration scale facility was commissioned and produced our first gallons of cellulosic ethanol out of the plant 
work to optimize the facility and make process improvements has continued throughout and into early to ensure reliable and cost effective operation 
we will require additional capital and operating expenditures to complete the optimization of our demonstration scale facility throughout we do not have fixed priced arrangements with our major engineering and construction firms  as such  most of our engineering and construction costs related to our demonstration facility are incurred and paid on a time and materials basis 
since  we have incurred significant costs in excess of our projected expenditures for the improvements to our pilot plant and construction  commissioning and optimization of our demonstration scale facility 
our financing activities generated net cash of million for the year ended december   consisting primarily of capital contributions by bp into galaxy and vercipia  our two consolidated variable interest entities  as well as our equity financing which closed in october

these costs scale up as our projected manufacturing volume increases 
vercipia is owned with operating lease agreements in florida for  net plantable acres and acres of improved and irrigated farmland being used by vercipia as a seed farm  intended for the growth of energy cane to be used as agricultural bio mass for our first cellulosic ethanol plant 
manufacturing and supply agreements during  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with fermic to provide us with the capacity to produce commercial quantities of enzyme products 
based on actual and projected increased product requirements  the agreement was amended in to provide for additional capacity to be installed over the next two years 
under the terms of the agreement  we can cancel the committed purchases with thirty months notice provided that the term of the agreement  including the termination notice period  aggregates four years 
pursuant to our agreement with fermic  we are also obligated to reimburse monthly costs related to manufacturing activities 
these costs scale up as our projected manufacturing volume increases 
as of december   under this agreement we have made minimum commitments to fermic of approximately million over the next two and a half years 
during  we anticipate funding as much as million in additional equipment costs related to our manufacturing agreement with fermic 
as we continue to develop our commercial manufacturing platforms  we may decide to purchase additional capital equipment under this agreement 
since inception through december   we had incurred costs of approximately million for property and equipment related to this agreement 
due to capacity constraints at fermic in  we were not able to supply adequate quantities of phyzyme necessary to meet the demand from danisco 
as a result  we contracted with genencor  a subsidiary of danisco  to serve as a second source manufacturer for phyzyme 
our supply agreement with danisco for phyzyme contains provisions which allow danisco  with six months advance notice  to assume the right to manufacture phyzyme 
if danisco were to exercise this right  we may experience excess capacity at fermic 
if danisco assumed the right to manufacture phyzyme and we were unable to absorb or otherwise reduce the excess capacity at fermic with other products  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected

the total amount required under the letter of credit is based on minimum required working capital and market capitalization 
as of december   we had a letter of credit in place pursuant to this agreement for approximately million  representing the  minimum and approximately months current rent 
the letter of credit is issued under our existing bank agreement 
we are required by the bank to secure this obligation with cash  which is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that would give rise to additional material contractual obligations as of december  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  long lived assets  accrued liabilities  convertible senior notes  and income taxes 
these estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we follow the provisions as set forth by authoritative accounting guidance 
we generally recognize revenue when we have satisfied all contractual obligations and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
we are often entitled to bill our customers and receive payment from our customers in advance of recognizing the revenue under current accounting rules 
in those instances where we have billed our customers or received payment from our customers in advance of recognizing revenue  we include the amounts in deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
we generate revenue from research collaborations generally through funded research  up front fees to initiate research projects  fees for exclusivity in a field  and milestones 
we recognize revenue from research funding on a proportional performance basis  as research hours are incurred under each agreement 
we recognize fees to initiate research over the life of the project 
we recognize revenue from exclusivity fees over the period of exclusivity 
our collaborations often include contractual milestones 
when we achieve these milestones  we are entitled to payment  as defined by the underlying agreements 
we recognize revenue for milestone payments when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgement from the collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii the milestone represents the culmination of an earnings process  iii the milestone payment is non refundable and iv our past research and development services  as well as our ongoing commitment to provide research and development services under the collaboration  are charged at fees that are comparable to the fees that the we customarily charge for similar research and development services 

table of contents we recognize revenue from grants as related costs are incurred  as long as such costs are within the funding limits specified by the underlying grant agreements 
we recognize revenue related to the sale of our inventory as we ship or deliver products  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we recognize revenue from products sold through distributors or other third party arrangements upon shipment of the products  if the distributor has a right of return  provided that a the price is substantially fixed and determinable at the time of sale  b the distributor s obligation to pay us is not contingent upon resale of the products  c title and risk of loss passes to the distributor at time of shipment  d the distributor has economic substance apart from that provided by us  e we have no significant obligation to the distributor to bring about resale of the products  and f future returns can be reasonably estimated 
for any sales that do not meet all of the above criteria  revenue is deferred until all such criteria have been met 
we include revenue from our royalty on operating profit in product revenues on the statement of operations 
we recognize royalty on operating profit during the quarter in which such revenues are earned based on calculations provided by our partner 
to date  we have generated a substantial portion of our product revenues  including royalty on operating profit  through our agreements with danisco 
we may record our quarterly royalty on operating profit based on estimates from danisco  and the final calculation of the royalty is sometimes finalized in the subsequent quarter  accordingly  we are subject to potential adjustments to our actual royalty on operating profit from quarter to quarter 
we have contracted with genencor  a subsidiary of danisco  to serve as a second source manufacturer of phyzyme 
under current accounting guidance  product manufactured for us by genencor is recognized on a net basis equal to the royalty on operating profit received from danisco  as all the following indicators of net revenue reporting are met i the third party is the obligor  ii the amount earned is fixed  and iii the third party maintains inventory risk  as compared to the full value of the manufacturing costs plus royalty on operating profit we currently recognize for phyzyme we manufacture 
we sometimes enter into revenue arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service 
in these cases  we recognize revenue from each element of the arrangement as long as we are able to determine a separate value for each element  we have completed our obligation to deliver or perform on that element and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
share based compensation effective january   we calculate the fair value of all share based payments to employees and non employee directors  including grants of stock options  non restricted and restricted shares  and awards issued under the employee stock purchase plan  and amortize these fair values to share based compensation in the income statement over the respective vesting periods of the underlying awards 
share based compensation related to stock options includes the amortization of the fair value of options at the date of grant determined using black scholes merton bsm valuation model 
we amortize the fair value of options to expense over the vesting periods of the underlying options 
share based compensation related to awards issued under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  after december  are based on calculations of fair value under the bsm valuation model which are similar to how stock option valuations are made 
we amortize the fair value of espp awards to expense over the vesting periods of the underlying awards 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards and awards under the espp on the date of grant using assumptions about volatility  expected life of the awards  risk free interest rate  and dividend yield rate 
the expected volatility in this model is based on the historical volatility of our common stock and an analysis of our peers 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time awards are granted  based on maturities which approximate the expected life of the options 
the expected life of the options 
table of contents granted is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees and an analysis of our peers 
the expected dividend rate takes into account the absence of any historical payments and management s intention to retain all earnings for future operations and expansion 
we estimate the fair value of non restricted and restricted stock awards based upon the closing market price of our common stock at the date of grant 
we charge the fair value of non restricted awards to share based compensation upon grant 
we amortize the fair value of restricted awards to share based compensation expense over the vesting period of the underlying awards 
convertible debt and derivative accounting we adopted new guidance as issued on january  which significantly impacted the accounting for our notes by requiring us to account separately for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt 
the liability component is measured so the effective interest expense associated with the convertible debt reflects the issuer s borrowing rate at the date of issuance for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature 
the difference between the cash proceeds associated with the convertible debt and this estimated fair value is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the convertible debt 
determining the fair value of the liability component requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on the determination of the liability component and  in effect  the associated interest expense 
according to the guidance  the carrying amount of the liability component is determined by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component 
if no similar liabilities exist  estimates of fair value are primarily determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the liability component  including market interest rates  credit standing  yield curves and volatilities 
at inception  we perform an assessment of all embedded features of a debt instrument to determine if such features should be bifurcated and separately accounted for  and  if bifurcation requirements are met  whether such features should be classified and accounted for as equity or liability 
the fair value of the embedded feature is measured initially  included as a liability on the balance sheet  and remeasured each reporting period 
any changes in fair value are recorded in the statement of operations 
we monitor  on an ongoing basis  whether events or circumstances could give rise to a change in our classification of embedded features 
we account for the conversion of our notes in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance  which states that upon conversion the difference between the carrying value of the converted notes and the fair value of the common stock delivered to the noteholders is recorded as a gain loss on debt extinguishment in our consolidated statement of operations 
variable interest entities we have implemented the provisions of authoritative accounting guidance  which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities either that do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or in which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest 
we have entered into a strategic collaboration with bp which includes two special purpose entities  galaxy and vercipia  both of which are jointly owned by bp and us 
we have determined that both galaxy and vercipia qualify as variable interest entities and that we are the primary beneficiary of both entities 
because we are the primary beneficiary  galaxy and vercipia are therefore subject to consolidation by us 
as a result  bp s capital contributions are recorded as noncontrolling interests in 
table of contents consolidated entities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we consolidate the operating results of galaxy and vercipia  and record an adjustment to the noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities for bp s share of profits and or losses in these entities 
long lived assets we review long lived assets  including leasehold improvements  property and equipment  and acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
this requires us to estimate future cash flows related to these assets 
actual results could differ from those estimates  which may affect the carrying amount of assets and the related amortization expense 
income taxes effective in  we account for income taxes pursuant to authoritative accounting guidance  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our tax return 
we do not recognize an uncertain tax position as a deferred tax asset if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
we adopted the updated authoritative guidance on january   and commenced analyzing filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
as a result of adoption  we have recorded no additional tax liability 
as of december  we have not yet completed our analysis of our deferred tax assets for net operating losses and research and development credits 
as such  we have removed these amounts and the offsetting valuation allowance from our deferred tax assets 
we are in the process of completing a section analysis regarding the limitation of the net operating loss and research and development credits 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase our income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
our deferred tax assets at december  were fully offset by a valuation allowance 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market value and  if necessary  reduce the value by an estimated allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the determination of the need for an allowance is based on our review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales  as well as judgments  quality control testing data  and assumptions about the likelihood of obsolescence 
recently issued accounting standards information with respect to recent accounting standards is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  foreign currency risk 

table of contents interest rate exposure as of december   all outstanding debt obligations of the company are comprised of fixed rate interest and  therefore  there is minimal interest rate exposure 
foreign currency exposure we engage third parties  including fermic  our contract manufacturing partner in mexico city  to provide various services 
from time to time certain of these services result in obligations that are denominated in other than us dollars 
foreign currency risk is minimized because the amount of such obligations is not material
