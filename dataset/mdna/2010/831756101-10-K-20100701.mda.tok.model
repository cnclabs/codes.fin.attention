item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
highlights our fiscal net sales of approximately million represented an increase of approximately over fiscal net sales 
sales in our firearm division increased by approximately to approximately million 
net income for fiscal was approximately million  or per fully diluted share  compared with a net loss of approximately million  or per fully diluted share  for fiscal net income for fiscal was impacted favorably by an approximately million adjustment to revalue  earn out shares related to our july acquisition of usr 
net income for fiscal was unfavorably impacted by an impairment charge related to goodwill and intangible assets of thompson center arms of approximately million  net of deferred taxes of approximately million 
excluding these two items  net income for fiscal increased by approximately million  or approximately  over fiscal net income 
net income for fiscal was affected by numerous factors  including the following growth in revenue of was driven by increased firearm sales of tactical rifles and walther new products offset by lower year over year demand for handgun offerings 
in addition  the acquisition of usr contributed approximately million to our consolidated revenue 
improved gross profit margin as a result of lower warranty costs  improved efficiencies  and lower promotional spending throughout the firearm facilities 
on july   we acquired usr  based in franklin  tennessee  which provides perimeter security solutions to protect and control access to key military  governmental  and corporate facilities 
our acquisition of usr was designed to leverage usr s business model  product line  and broad customer base to enable us to expand into new markets in the security industry 
results of operations for the period ended april  included activity for the period subsequent to the acquisition 
on january   the doj unsealed indictments of individuals from the law enforcement and military equipment industries  one of whom was our vice president sales  international us law enforcement 
we were not charged in the indictment 
we also were served with a grand jury subpoena for the production of documents 
we have always taken  and continue to take seriously  our obligation as an industry leader to foster a responsible and ethical culture  which includes adherence to laws and industry regulations in the united states and abroad 
although we are cooperating fully with the doj and the sec in these matters  the doj may determine that we have violated fcpa laws or the sec may determine that we have violated federal securities laws 
as of april   we have incurred  of legal and consulting costs related to this matter 
our business we are one of the world s leading manufacturers of firearms 
we manufacture a wide array of pistols  revolvers  tactical rifles  hunting rifles  black powder firearms  handcuffs  and firearm related products and accessories for sale to a wide variety of customers  including gun enthusiasts  collectors  hunters  sportsmen  competitive shooters  individuals desiring home and personal protection  law enforcement and security agencies and officers  and military agencies in the united states and throughout the world 
we are the largest manufacturer of handguns and handcuffs in the united states  the largest us exporter of handguns  and a participant in the tactical and hunting rifle markets 
we are also a leading turnkey provider of perimeter security solutions to protect and control access to key military  governmental  and corporate facilities 
we manufacture our firearm products at our 
table of contents facilities in springfield  massachusetts  houlton  maine  and rochester  new hampshire 
we manufacture and assemble our perimeter security products at our facilities in franklin  tennessee 
in addition  we pursue opportunities to license our name and trademarks to third parties for use in association with their products and services 
we plan to substantially increase our product offerings to leverage the plus year old smith wesson brand and capitalize on the goodwill developed through our historic american tradition by expanding consumer awareness of products we produce or license in the safety  security  protection  and sport markets 
key performance indicators we evaluate the performance of our business based upon operating profit  which includes net sales  cost of sales  selling and administrative expenses  and certain components of other income and expense 
we also use adjusted ebitdas earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense  excluding large non recurring items  which is a non gaap financial metric  to evaluate our performance 
we evaluate our various firearm product lines by such measurements as cost per unit produced  units produced per day  and incoming orders per day 
we evaluate our perimeter security products by revenue invoiced  gross margin per job  and incoming orders per month 
key industry data handguns have been subject to legislative actions in the past  and the market has reacted to these actions 
there was a substantial increase in sales in the early s during the period leading up to and shortly after the enactment of the brady bill 
in the period from through  the us handgun market increased by over  as consumers purchased handguns because of the fear of prohibition of handgun ownership 
the market levels then returned to pre levels and remained relatively unchanged until late in calendar  when the market increased in what appears to be fears surrounding crime and terrorism  an economic downturn  and a change in the white house administration 
like the increase in  as we expected  this increase in the market was temporary in nature and the market returned to more normal levels in fiscal within the us handgun market  we estimate that approximately of the market is pistols and is revolvers 
we also estimate that we have approximately a share of the us consumer market for handguns 
this compares with approximately in the period just before we acquired smith wesson corp 
in it also compares with market share figures of the s when we had an estimated market share 

table of contents results of operations net sales the following table sets forth certain information relative to net sales for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change revolvers pistols walther tactical rifles premium products hunting firearms parts accessories total firearms handcuffs specialty services other non firearms total firearm division perimeter security division total products and services sales fiscal net products and services sales compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal increased because of strong consumer driven growth in tactical rifles and the impact of our acquisition of usr in july revolver sales were slightly lower than in the prior fiscal year 
unit sales were down approximately due to reduced availability of product to meet the extremely high level of demand in the early part of the fiscal year coupled with delayed international shipments related to our investigation of the fcpa matter 
these factors were partially offset by reduced promotional costs 
pistol sales were approximately lower than in the prior fiscal year with metal and sigma pistols being significantly below last year  and m p series of pistols flat year over year 
walther product sales grew approximately based on the pk pistol product introduction and increased production and availability of the german manufactured products 
the introduction of our new m p tactical rifle and increases in our capacity to produce all tactical rifles to meet higher consumer demand led to increased sales of these products 
new product offerings within our classics series of handguns increased sales of products within our premium product lines by approximately over the prior fiscal year 
hunting products were negatively impacted by the late fiscal discontinuation of smith wesson branded bolt action rifles  but this was more than offset by the increased performance of thompson center arms branded bolt action rifles spurred by our introduction of the venture tm product line and an improvement in the second half of fiscal in black powder rifle sales 
parts and accessories sales grew because of an increased sales focus on hunting products and higher demand for parts and accessories in our handgun lines  reflecting the high demand for both new and used firearms 
the order backlog as of april  was approximately  of which  related to firearms  with the balance of  related to perimeter security 
the firearm order backlog was approximately  lower than at the end of fiscal  but represented an approximately  increase over the prior quarter end primarily as a result of backlog generated by new products 
in spite of the year over year decline in firearm backlog  our fiscal year end backlog remained substantially higher than what we typically experienced prior to the extraordinary increases in consumer demand in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal perimeter security backlog declined approximately  from the prior quarter 
table of contents end as customer investment decisions began to slow 
firearm orders received that have not yet shipped could be cancelled  particularly if demand were to suddenly decrease 
therefore  the firearm backlog may not be indicative of future sales 
our perimeter security backlog consists primarily of project oriented contracts and or letters of intent that provide for progress payments and are not typically cancelled 
therefore  perimeter security backlog is more indicative of future sales  but is subject to significant timing variations depending on the size  nature  and scope of each order within the total backlog at any given period of time 
sales in the consumer channel were approximately  a  or  increase over sales of approximately  for fiscal sales to state and local government agencies were approximately  a  or  increase over fiscal sales of approximately  and included approximately  of perimeter security sales 
international sales of approximately  represented a  or  increase over fiscal sales 
excluding approximately  of perimeter security sales  federal government sales of approximately  were  higher than fiscal sales of approximately  sales to corporate customers in our perimeter security division totaled approximately  in fiscal fiscal net product and services sales compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal increased because of strong consumer driven growth in handgun and tactical rifle sales 
revolver sales were driven primarily by consumer demand  however  because revolvers are much more capital intensive  the growth year over year was smaller than in other handgun product lines 
pistol sales increased on strong demand for sigma and m p series of pistols  with sales for those product lines up approximately and  respectively  over the prior fiscal year 
walther product sales increased significantly over the prior fiscal year as a result of higher sales of the p pistol and the full year benefit of the pps pistol  which was introduced during fiscal walther ppk pistol sales were suspended in the fourth quarter of fiscal because of the february recall of this product  which adversely impacted fourth quarter sales 
tactical rifle sales continued to increase as a result of increased consumer demand  as well as continued acceptance by law enforcement agencies 
hunting firearms were severely impacted by economic factors  with black powder sales dropping approximately from fiscal levels 
the decrease in parts and accessories correlated to the decrease in black powder rifle sales 
non firearm sales for fiscal were flat with increased handcuff sales offset by reduced foundry sales 
the order backlog at the end of fiscal was approximately  which was approximately  higher than at the end of fiscal and approximately  higher than at the end of our previous fiscal quarter 
the extraordinary increase in backlog related directly to the increase in consumer demand that we experienced in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal it also increased as a result of our previously planned manufacturing capacity prior to the significant increase in consumer demand 
sales in the consumer channel were approximately  a  or  increase over sales of approximately  for fiscal excluding hunting products  sporting good sales increased approximately over fiscal levels 
sales to state and local government agencies were approximately  a  or  increase over fiscal sales of approximately  international sales of approximately  represented a  or  increase over fiscal sales 
federal government sales of approximately  were  lower than fiscal sales of approximately  cost of revenue and gross profit the following table sets forth certain information regarding cost of revenue and gross profit for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change cost of revenue of net revenue gross profit of net revenue 
table of contents gross profit for fiscal grew as a result of the increase in sales while gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased as a result of improved efficiencies in our firearm business 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenue improved as a result of an approximately  reduction in warranty expense  lower promotional spending  and favorable absorption resulting from high production volume to meet consumer demand 
in addition  reduced manufacturing spending and improved material efficiencies at our rochester  new hampshire facility contributed to the improved gross margin percentage 
we reduced promotional spending by approximately  during fiscal from fiscal levels 
gross profit for fiscal for our firearm division was approximately  or of sales  versus approximately  or of sales 
gross profit for fiscal for our perimeter security division was approximately  or 
the impact of our acquisition of usr had an unfavorable impact on our total gross profit as a percentage of net revenue largely as a result of amortization of acquisition related intangibles that reduced gross margin by approximately  and the additional costs incurred as we continue to expand that business 
gross profit for fiscal grew as a result of the increase in sales while gross profit as a percentage of net revenue declined as a result of the impact of significantly lower sales and production volumes of our higher margin hunting products and an approximately  accrual related to the february walther ppk and ppk s recall 
reduced production levels and a reduced number of operating days necessary to meet reduced demand at our rochester  new hampshire plant resulted in underutilized capacity and the inability to fully absorb fixed overhead into inventory 
in addition  increased capital spending over the last several years increased depreciation expense by approximately  for fiscal promotional costs were approximately  compared with approximately  for the year ended april  operating expenses the following table sets forth certain information regarding operating expenses for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change research and development sales and marketing general and administrative impairment of long lived assets operating expenses of net revenue excluding the impact of the impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal for goodwill and other long lived intangible assets related to our thompson center arms acquisition and approximately  of operating expense incurred in connection with our newly acquired usr operation  operating expenses for fiscal grew approximately  because of increased profit sharing and management incentive compensation related to improved financial performance versus the prior fiscal year  increased administrative costs related to our acquisition of usr  including legal and accounting related consulting fees  and increased legal and consulting fees related to allegations against one of our employees under the fcpa 
this was partially offset by lower amortization of intangibles due to our impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets of thompson center arms and lower bad debt reserve charges that arose from the sudden decline in the economy during calendar the increase in research and development costs related to approximately  in increased samples and testing materials in support of new product introductions  approximately  in increased salaries and benefits  approximately  of perimeter security costs incurred subsequent to our acquisition of usr  and approximately  of reduced allocations to manufacturing based on an increased focus on new product engineering 
the increase in sales and marketing expense reflected approximately  in increased salaries and benefits as well as approximately  in increased commissions in the hunting business as we transitioned back to the use of a manufacturers representative sales model 
in addition  travel costs increased approximately  and marketing consulting increased by approximately  while advertising and marketing samples declined approximately  excluding the approximately  impact of acquiring 
table of contents usr  the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted from an approximately  increase in profit sharing and management incentives with the exclusion of the impairment from the calculation  approximately  of increased recruiting and relocation costs  approximately  in increased professional fees related to both defense costs and our internal investigation of the fcpa matter  and approximately  in increased professional fees related to the acquisition of usr 
offsetting these costs was approximately  of reduced bad debt costs and approximately  in reduced amortization of intangible assets subsequent to the impairment of the thompson center arms assets in fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was approximately for fiscal and approximately for fiscal  excluding the impairment charge 
this approximately increase is predominately attributed to the approximately  incurred in the fcpa investigation and employee defense costs 
in october  due to serious  unfavorable  and recurring economic and market conditions and other factors that had an adverse effect on the hunting market  it became apparent that goodwill and other long lived assets related to our thompson center arms acquisition were significantly impaired 
we conducted a review of the reporting unit related to these products and determined that the fair value was lower than book value  requiring us to record an impairment charge of approximately  excluding the impact of the impairment charge noted above  operating expenses for fiscal increased by approximately  or  over fiscal levels 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal research and development costs related to approximately  in increased testing materials as a result of the increasing cost of ammunition  approximately  in third party engineering costs  approximately  in increased salaries and benefits  and approximately  of reduced allocations to manufacturing based on an increased focus on new product engineering 
the increase in sales and marketing expense reflected increased sales incentives incurred as a result of the higher handgun sales levels 
the increase in general and administrative expenses included approximately  in increased profit sharing related to our springfield  massachusetts and houlton  maine facilities 
in addition  because of weak economic factors impacting certain of our regional retail customers  we increased our bad debt reserves by approximately  in fiscal finally  increased salaries and benefits  recruiting  and relocation resulting from changes in our management structure totaling approximately  were offset by approximately  in reduced amortization of intangible assets resulting from the impairment charge and lower stock based compensation expense of approximately  due to lower awards and the reversal of the expense associated with performance based options that were not achieved based on actual operating results 
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue  excluding the impairment charge  was approximately for fiscal  approximately lower than the fiscal ratio due to reduced amortization of intangible assets as a result of the impairment charge as well as increased revenue caused by the increased consumer demand 
general and administrative costs for fiscal included approximately  of amortization while fiscal included approximately  of amortization 
income loss from operations the following table sets forth certain information regarding income loss from operations for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change income loss from operations of net revenue excluding the fiscal impact of the approximately  impairment of thompson center arms assets  fiscal operating income of approximately  was  or  higher than operating income of approximately  for fiscal increased revenue and improved margins in the firearm business more than offset the initial loss from operations associated with the perimeter security business and the impact of fcpa costs on operating expenses 

table of contents excluding the impact of the approximately  impairment of thompson center arms assets  fiscal operating income of approximately  was  or  higher than operating income for fiscal the impact associated with the consumer driven demand more than offset the unfavorable absorption and product mix at thompson center arms  the impact of the walther ppk and ppk s recall  and the increase in operating expenses 
other income expense the following table sets forth certain information regarding other income expense for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change other income expense in fiscal  other income expense included approximately  of income associated with the revaluation of  shares expected to be paid in conjunction with our acquisition of usr see note 
excluding this amount  the remaining other expense of approximately  represents  among other things  unrealized losses on foreign exchange contracts and fines and penalties incurred on late filings or payments on tax returns  as does the approximately  in fiscal interest expense the following table sets forth certain information regarding interest expense for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change interest expense interest expense decreased for fiscal as a result of the repayment of approximately  of long term debt in december and overall increased cash balances throughout the fiscal year 
interest expense decreased for fiscal as a result of the repayment of the  acquisition line in may  the repayment of approximately  of long term debt in june  reduced borrowings under our revolving line of credit  and overall lower interest rates 
in addition  our  share stock offering in may and the increased cash flow associated with consumer demand enabled us to reduce our overall outstanding indebtedness throughout fiscal income taxes the following table sets forth certain information regarding income tax expense benefit for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change income tax expense benefit our income tax expense for fiscal included the effect of changes in temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and net operating loss carryforwards 
these amounts are reflected in the balance of our net deferred tax assets  which totaled approximately  after valuation allowance  as of april  as required by accounting standards codification asc topic  we record tax assets or liabilities for the temporary differences between the book value and tax bases in assets and liabilities 
in assessing the realization of our deferred income tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets depends upon generating future taxable income during the periods in which our temporary differences become deductible and before our net operating loss carryforwards expire 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred income tax assets by assessing the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be recovered  we establish a valuation allowance against some or all of our 
table of contents deferred income tax assets 
recording a valuation allowance or reversing a valuation allowance could have a significant effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
a valuation allowance of approximately  was provided on our deferred federal tax assets for a capital loss carryforward  which we do not anticipate using prior to its expiration 
no other valuation allowance was provided on our deferred federal income tax assets as of april  or  as we believe that it is more likely than not that all such assets will be realized 
we had federal net operating loss carryforwards amounting to approximately   and  as of april    and  respectively 
we obtained approximately  in additional loss carryforwards through our acquisition of usr on july  the net operating loss carryforward at april  expires in fiscal years and internal revenue code section limits our utilization of these losses to approximately  in fiscal  approximately  in  and approximately  per subsequent year 
it is possible that future substantial changes in our ownership could occur that could result in a reduction in some or all of our loss carryforwards pursuant to internal revenue code section if such an ownership change were to occur  there would be an annual limitation on the remaining tax loss carryforwards that could be utilized 
utilization of federal net operating losses and amortization of intangible assets have decreased the overall net deferred tax asset to approximately  as of april  federal net operating losses account for approximately  of the total net deferred tax asset of approximately  as of april  there was approximately  of state net operating loss carryforwards as of april  there were no state net operating loss carryforwards as of april  or on october   the american jobs creation act ajca  was signed into law 
the ajca provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activity qpa 
pursuant to asc  the effect of this deduction is reported in the period in which it is claimed on our tax return 
the qpa benefit for us was approximately  in fiscal and approximately  in fiscal  which resulted in the reduction of tax expense of approximately  in fiscal and approximately  in fiscal the annual deduction for the remaining federal net operating loss carryforward is so limited by internal revenue code section that the unfavorable impact on the future benefits of the qpa should be negligible 
our income tax benefit for fiscal included the effect of changes in temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and net operating loss carryforwards 
these amounts are reflected in the balance of our net deferred tax assets  which totaled approximately  after valuation allowance  as of april  net deferred tax liabilities were reduced in fiscal by approximately  as a result of the impairment of the thompson center arms goodwill and other long lived assets 
net income loss the following table sets forth certain information regarding net income loss and the related per share data for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands  except per share data change change net income loss net income loss per share basic diluted excluding the approximately  favorable fair value adjustment on the usr earn out liability in fiscal and the approximately  impact of the thompson center arms impairment charge  net income increased by approximately  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due to increased sales and margin in the firearm business offset by increased costs associated with the fcpa matter  acquisition costs expensed during the fiscal year  and a loss recorded for usr due to acquisition accounting amortization 
excluding the impact of the fair value adjustments  diluted earnings per share would have been and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  an approximately increase in spite of a  share offering in may and the issuance of  shares in conjunction with the usr acquisition 

table of contents the decrease in net income and net income per share for fiscal was primarily attributable to the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill associated with the acquisition of thompson center arms  which totaled approximately  net of deferred taxes of approximately 
excluding this write off  fiscal income would have increased approximately  to approximately  and earnings per share would have been 
this increase in income over the prior fiscal year was a result of increased sales due to the consumer driven demand  partially offset by reduced volume and the corresponding gross margin impact in the hunting business 
in addition  earnings per share was lower in fiscal due to an additional  shares issued during may liquidity and capital resources our principal cash requirements are to finance the growth of our operations  including acquisitions  and to service our existing debt 
capital expenditures for new products  capacity expansion  and process improvements represent important cash needs 
the following table sets forth certain cash flow information for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change operating activities investing activities financing activities total operating activities represent the principal source of our cash flow 
cash flow from operating activities decreased significantly for fiscal from fiscal levels  largely as a result of the impact that the fiscal spike in consumer demand had on reducing year end accounts receivable and inventory as of april  accounts receivable increased by approximately  due to relatively high april firearm sales and the acquisition of usr 
inventory increased approximately  during fiscal primarily due to the slowdown in consumer demand  which allowed for the replenishment of some firearm safety stock 
cash paid for income taxes represented a significant increase during fiscal due to the significant increase in profitability of the consolidated company 
cash flow from operating activities increased significantly for fiscal over fiscal levels  largely as a result of an approximately  decrease in inventory in fiscal in addition  accounts receivable decreased by approximately  in fiscal finally  an approximately  increase in net income excluding the non cash impairment and an increase in current accrual levels of approximately  over the prior fiscal year increase contributed to the increase in cash from operating activities 
cash used for investing activities was higher in fiscal than for fiscal due to approximately  invested in the acquisition of usr and increased capital spending of approximately cash used for investing activities was lower in fiscal than for fiscal due to reduced capital spending of approximately cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was favorable compared with the prior fiscal year due to lower long term debt repayments totaling approximately  and a fiscal repayment of  in revolving line borrowings 
in addition  proceeds from share issuances in fiscal were approximately  higher than proceeds received in fiscal cash used by financing activities in fiscal was unfavorable compared with the prior fiscal year due to the repayment of the  acquisition loan  approximately  in term loans  and  in the revolving line partially offset by the proceeds from the  share offering in may 
table of contents at april   we had open letters of credit aggregating approximately  at april   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we have a  revolving line of credit with td bank  na with no balance outstanding as of april  the credit agreement with td bank contains financial covenants relating to maintaining maximum leverage and minimum debt service coverage 
the agreement relating to our senior convertible notes contains a financial covenant relating to maximum additional indebtedness 
we were in compliance with the debt covenants as of april  based upon our current working capital position  current operating plans  and expected business conditions  we believe that our existing capital resources and credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operations  including our outstanding debt and other commitments  for the next months  apart from major acquisitions 
other matters inflation we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on us during fiscal   or critical accounting policies use of estimates in preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
operating results in the future could vary from the amounts derived from these estimates and assumptions 
in addition  future facts and circumstances could alter our estimates with respect to the adequacy of insurance reserves 
our significant estimates include gross margin and percentage of completion on in process perimeter security projects  accruals for warranty  product liability  workers compensation  environmental liability  excess and obsolete inventory  forfeiture rates on stock based awards  asset impairments  and medical claims payable 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition for our firearm segment  we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
for our perimeter security segment  we recognize revenue from fixed price installation contracts using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to our total costs for each contract 
product sales account for a substantial portion of our firearm revenue 
we recognize revenue from firearm product sales when the earnings process is complete and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which is generally upon shipment 
we also provide tooling  forging  heat treating  finishing  plating  and engineering support services to customers  we recognize this revenue when accepted by the customer  when no further contingencies or material performance obligations exist  and when collectibility is reasonably assured  thereby earning us the right to receive and retain payments for services performed and billed 
we recognize trademark licensing revenue for individual licensees on a quarterly basis based on historical experience and expected cash receipts from licensees 
this revenue consists of minimum royalties and or a percentage of a licensee s sales on licensed products 
under our current licensing agreements  this revenue is payable on a calendar quarter basis 
we recognize non refundable license fees received upon initial signing of license agreements as revenue when no future obligation is required on our part 
as a result of a combination of uncertain factors regarding existing licensees  including current and past payment performance  market acceptance of the licensee s product  and insufficient historical experience  we believe that reasonable assurance of collectibility does not exist based on the results and past payment performance of licensees in general 
therefore  we do not recognize minimum royalty payments upon contract signing but instead record royalty revenue monthly when the minimum royalty can be reasonably estimated for that month and payment is assured 
as of april   minimum royalties to be collected in the future amounted to approximately  
table of contents valuation of long lived tangible and intangible assets and goodwill we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets  which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions 
the most significant long lived tangible and intangible assets are fixed assets  developed technology  patents  trademarks  and tradenames 
we amortize all finite lived intangible assets either on a straight line basis or based upon patterns in which we expect to utilize the economic benefits of such assets 
with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  we initially determine the values of intangible assets by a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
we assess the potential impairment of identifiable intangible assets and fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment of such assets  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization below net book value 
future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would materially impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis as of the end of our fiscal third quarter and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  to assess whether impairment is present 
we have reviewed the provisions of asc with respect to the criteria necessary to evaluate the number of reporting units that exist 
based on our review of the segment reporting topic  asc  we have determined that we operate in three reporting units one for our springfield  massachusetts and houlton  maine facilities  a second for our rochester  new hampshire facility  and a third for usr 
we have determined that we operate in two segments one for our firearm companies and a second for our perimeter security subsidiary  usr 
goodwill recorded on our books as of april  is associated only with usr as it arose out of our acquisition of usr on july  based on a combination of factors occurring during fiscal  including the economic environment and market conditions in the hunting industry  we determined that indicators for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets existed in our rochester  new hampshire reporting unit and  as a result  we conducted an evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of that reporting unit 
based on lower order intake during fiscal and lower than expected operating profits and cash flows in this reporting unit  the earnings forecast for the next ten years was revised 
the fair value of this reporting unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
based on the work performed  we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of  during the three months ended october  we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded carrying value for the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
as noted above  economic and market conditions affecting the rochester  new hampshire reporting unit required us to test for impairment of long lived assets pertaining to that location during the second quarter of fiscal based on this assessment  we recorded an impairment charge of  to reflect the excess of the carrying value of long lived intangible assets over the discounted cash flows 
no impairment charges were taken in fiscal based on the review of long lived assets 
based on our review of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for our perimeter security reporting unit as of february   utilizing a discounted cash flow method at a discount rate of  we determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of that unit by and the fair value of indefinite lived assets is 
table of contents substantially in excess of carrying value 
as of april   goodwill for this reporting unit is  which represents the entire amount of goodwill recorded on our books 
we utilize an income approach  with discounted cash flows  to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit 
we selected this method because we believe that it most appropriately measures our income producing assets 
we considered using the market approach and the cost approach  but concluded that they were not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant and available market comparisons 
the income approach is based on the projected cash flows that are discounted to their present value using discount rates that consider the timing and risk of the forecasted cash flows 
we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units expected long term operating cash performance 
this approach also mitigates the impact of the cyclical trends that occur in our industries 
fair value is estimated using internally developed forecasts and assumptions 
the discount rate used is the average estimated value of a market participant s cost of capital and debt  derived using customary market metrics 
other significant assumptions include terminal value margin rates  future capital expenditures  and changes in future working capital requirements 
we also compare and reconcile our overall fair value to our market capitalization 
while there are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to our application of these assumptions to this analysis  we believe that the income approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of our reporting units 
the foregoing assumptions were consistent with our long term performance  with limited exceptions 
we believe that our future investments for capital expenditures as a percent of revenue will decline in future years due to our improved utilization resulting from lean initiatives  and we believe that days sales outstanding will decline as we grow 
we also have assumed that through this economic downturn  our markets have not contracted for the long term  however  it may be a number of years before they fully recover 
these assumptions could deviate materially from actual results 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the useful lives of our long lived assets  determining what reporting units exist  and assessing when events or circumstances would require an interim impairment analysis of goodwill or other long lived assets to be performed 
changes in our organization or our management reporting structure  as well as other events and circumstances  including technological advances  increased competition  and changing economic or market conditions  could result in a shorter estimated useful lives  b additional reporting units  which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater disaggregation or aggregation in our analysis by reporting unit  and c other changes in previous assumptions or estimates 
a change in the weighted average cost of capital  for example  could materially change the valuation and  if increased  could cause an impairment 
in turn  this could have an additional impact on our consolidated financial statements through accelerated amortization and impairment charges 
goodwill and acquired intangibles we completed a significant business acquisition in fiscal  which resulted in significant goodwill and other intangible asset balances 
our business strategy contemplates that we may make additional acquisitions in the future 
our accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates  including the fair value of certain forms of consideration  the fair value of acquired intangible assets  which involve projections of future revenue and cash flows  the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including potential contingencies  and the useful lives  and as applicable  the reporting unit  of the assets 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially impacted by changes in our initial assumptions and estimates relating to prior or future acquisitions 
additionally  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit  for purposes of the first step in our annual goodwill impairment test  based on our market value 
if prior or future acquisitions are not accretive to our results of operations as expected or our market value declines dramatically  we may be required to complete the second step  which requires significant judgments and estimates and which may result in material impairment charges in the period in which they are determined

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not enter into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
our principal market risk relates to changes in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar 
a portion of our gross revenue during the three months and fiscal year ended april  million and million  respectively  representing approximately and  respectively  of aggregate gross revenue came from the sale of goods that were purchased  wholly or partially  from a european manufacturer  in euros 
annually  we purchase approximately million of inventory from a european supplier 
this exposes us to risk from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a drop in the value of the us dollar in relation to the euro would  to the extent not covered through price adjustments  reduce our gross profit on that million of inventory by approximately million 
in an effort to offset our risks from unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations  we periodically enter into euro participating forward options under which we purchase euros to be used to pay the european manufacturer 
as of april   our outstanding forward contracts had a remaining balance of million euros  or approximately million 
the contracts are for  euros per month with the last expiring on june  subsequent to april   we entered into new contracts totaling million euros  or approximately million  that will expire in varying rates between  and million euros per month through april  participating forward options provide full protection for us against the depreciation of the us dollar to the euro and partial benefit from the appreciation of the us dollar to the euro 
if the euro strengthens above the average rate  we will not pay more than the average rate 
if the euro weakens below the average rate  of the euros are at the average rate and the remaining of the euros are paid for at the spot rate 
each option  unless used on the first day  will be converted to a forward contract  due when needed during the month at a slight up charge in rate 
during the three months and fiscal year ended april   we experienced a net unfavorable cost of approximately  and  respectively  on foreign exchange transactions that we executed during the period in an effort to limit our exposure to fluctuations in the euro dollar exchange rate
