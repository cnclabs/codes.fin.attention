microcyn technology is a non irritating oxychlorine compound designed to treat a wide range of pathogens  including antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria  viruses  fungi and spores 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to exercise its judgment 
we exercise considerable judgment with respect to establishing sound accounting policies and in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  our recognition of revenues and expenses  and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
areas in which we exercise significant judgment include  but are not necessarily limited to  our valuation of accounts receivable  inventory  income taxes  equity transactions compensatory and financing and contingencies 
we have also adopted certain polices with respect to our recognition of revenue that we believe are consistent with the guidance provided under securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
we base our estimates and judgments on a variety of factors including our historical experience  knowledge of our business and industry  current and expected economic conditions  the attributes of our products  regulatory environment  and in certain cases  the results of outside appraisals 
we periodically re evaluate our estimates and assumptions with respect to these judgments and modify our approach when circumstances indicate that modifications are necessary 
while we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting policies  we cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate 
since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment  actual results could differ from such estimates 
a description of significant accounting policies that require us to make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is as follows stock based compensation we account for share based awards exchanged for employee services at the estimated grant date fair value of the award 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
we amortize the fair value of employee stock options on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the awards 
compensation expense includes the impact of an estimate for forfeitures for all stock options 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees at their fair value on the measurement date 
the measurement of stock based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instrument vests or becomes non forfeitable 
non employee stock based compensation charges are amortized over the vesting period or as earned 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we generate product revenues from sales of our products to hospitals  medical centers  doctors  pharmacies  distributors and strategic partners 
we sell our products directly to third parties and to distributors through various cancelable distribution agreements 
we have also entered into an agreement to license our products 
we record revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability of the sale is reasonably assured 
we require all of our product sales to be supported by evidence of a sale transaction that clearly indicates the selling price to the customer  shipping terms and payment terms 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of a contract or purchase order approved by the customer 
we have ongoing relationships with certain customers from which we customarily accept orders by telephone in lieu of a purchase order 
we recognize revenues at the time in which we receive a confirmation that the goods were either tendered at their destination when shipped fob destination  or transferred to a shipping agent when shipped fob shipping point 
delivery to the customer is deemed to have occurred when the customer takes title to the product 
generally  title passes to the customer upon shipment  but could occur when the customer receives the product based on the terms of the agreement with the customer 
while we have a policy of investigating the creditworthiness of our customers  we have  under certain circumstances  shipped goods in the past and deferred the recognition of revenues when available information indicates that collection is in doubt 
we establish allowances for doubtful accounts when available information causes us to believe that a credit loss is probable 
our treatment for recognizing revenue related to distributors that have the inability to provide inventory or product sell through reports on a timely basis  is to defer and recognize revenue when payment is received 
we believe the receipt of payment is the best indication of product sell through 
we have entered into distribution agreements in europe 
recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue from product sales is deferred until the product is sold from the distributors to their customers 
service revenues are recorded upon performance of the service contracts 
revenues generated from testing contracts are recorded when the test is completed and the final report is sent to the customer 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost  cost being determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis  or market 
due to changing market conditions  estimated future requirements  age of the inventories on hand and production of new products  we regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
income taxes we are required to determine the aggregate amount of income tax expense or loss based upon tax statutes in jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
in making these estimates  we adjust our results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing authorities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from these differences  are reflected on our balance sheet for temporary differences in loss and credit carryforwards that will reverse in subsequent years 
we also establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
valuation allowances are based  in part  on predictions that management must make as to our results in future periods 
the outcome of events could differ over time which would require that we make changes in our valuation allowance 
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
these estimates and assumptions include reserves and write downs related to receivables and inventories  the recoverability of long term assets  deferred taxes and related valuation allowances and valuation of equity instruments 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards codification or asc contracts in entity s own equity 
this issue addresses the determination of whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock 
this issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have included the impact of asc in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended march  in april  the fasb issued asc determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
based on the guidance  if an entity determines that the level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased and that a transaction is not orderly  further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed  and a significant adjustment to the transaction or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards asc fair value measurements 
this is to be applied prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  the adoption has no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued asc  financial instruments 
this standard extends the disclosure requirements concerning the fair value of financial instruments to interim financial statements of publicly traded companies 
this guidance is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june   and as such  became effective in the quarter ended june  the adoption of asc had no material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued guidance now codified as asc topic  subsequent events 
asc topic establishes standards for the disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date  but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
asc topic introduces the concept of financial statements being available to be issued 
it requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date 
the disclosure should alert all users of financial statements that an entity has not evaluated subsequent events after that date in the set of financial statements being presented 
we adopted asc topic for the period ended june  the adoption of asc topic had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this asu will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 subsequent events topic amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements 
asu requires an entity that is an sec filer to evaluate subsequent events through the date that the financial statements are issued and removes the requirement that an sec filer disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
asc was effective upon issuance 
the adoption of this standard had no effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method topic milestone method of revenue recognition 
this standard provides that the milestone method is a valid application of the proportional performance model for revenue recognition if the milestones are substantive and there is substantive uncertainty about whether the milestones will be achieved 
determining whether a milestone is substantive requires judgment that should be made at the inception of the arrangement 
to meet the definition of a substantive milestone  the consideration earned by achieving the milestone would have to be commensurate with either the level of effort required to achieve the milestone or the enhancement in the value of the item delivered  would have to relate solely to past performance  and should be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
no bifurcation of an individual milestone is allowed and there can be more than one milestone in an arrangement 
the new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the fasb  the emerging issues task force  the sec and or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption
