item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of this annual report on form k 
overview of performance and company and industry trends 
the overall economic downturn  characterized by declining real estate values  high unemployment and lower consumer spending  had an adverse effect on the company s operating performance during in spite of the effects of the economy  the company took aggressive steps to improve its balance sheet  gain operating efficiencies and to generate positive leasing and condominium sales momentum 
in addition  the company took advantage  to a limited extent  of capitalizing on opportunities presented by economic conditions 
operationally  was dominated by declining values in residential real estate that resulted in a decline in lot sales  downward pressure on sales prices on condominium units and impairment charges on the company s residential land and condominium holdings 
during the year  residential lot sales decreased from the relatively low level of in to in these low sales  combined with deteriorating projections for future lot prices and extended holding periods  led to impairment charges of million that the company recorded in related to its investments in residential joint ventures 
similarly  the general economic conditions for the condominium market and the oversupply of units in the company s markets resulted in a virtual halt in sales activity during the first half of at its recently completed terminus project in the buckhead district of atlanta  the company closed only two of its units in the first six months of in addition  the company suspended development of its glenmore gardens townhome project in charlotte  north carolina and was forced to foreclose on a condominium project on which it provided mezzanine financing in asheville  north carolina 
as a result of these market conditions and revised projections for selling the units or projects in total  the company recorded impairment charges on these projects that totaled million 
while market fundamentals remained more stable for the company s portfolio of stabilized office properties  they had an adverse effect on terminus  a newly developed  class a office building adjacent to its terminus condominium project 
the challenges of the overall economy combined with an oversupply of newly developed competing product in the area resulted in this project being only leased several months after substantial completion 
while the project has a strategic location for long term value  the current issues with the market and the economy caused the company to record a million impairment charge on its investment in the venture that owns terminus in the economy also impacted the company s overall development activities 
in  the company commenced no new development projects 
the company is actively pursuing a limited number of projects  but it made the decision in to abandon efforts associated with several projects that it had been working on for a number of years 
as a result  the company charged to expense million in previously capitalized pre development expenditures associated with these abandoned projects 

table of contents in spite of the challenges of the economy  the company made progress leasing vacant space in its stabilized portfolio 
during  the company executed  square feet of new retail leases to take the retail portfolio from leased at the beginning of the year to leased at the end of the year 
office percent leased did not deteriorate significantly during in spite of three lease expirations totaling approximately  square feet 
at year end  the company s portfolio of stabilized office properties was leased 
the company s portfolio of stabilized industrial properties increased by percentage points during as a result of the expansion of a tenant in the king mill project 
also  in the second half of  the company began generating momentum in sales of its condominium projects 
at terminus  after an evaluation of and reduction in the pricing structure of its units  the company sold units from july to december  generating proceeds of million and profits of million 
at its asheville project  the company sold units generating proceeds of million and profits of  subsequent to year end  the company sold its glenmore garden villas project to a local developer for million 
this activity has considerably reduced the risks associated with the company s condominium and townhome assets 
as of year end  the company had units at terminus remaining to be sold and unsold units at its asheville project 
the company also took advantage  where possible  of opportunistic transactions that presented themselves in the market 
in the second quarter of  the company reached an agreement with its lender on san jose marketcenter to repay in full an million mortgage loan for million 
this opportunity presented itself because of the lender s desire to have additional cash at the time and was not a reflection of the value or performance of the underlying collateral 
also in the second quarter  the company purchased a distressed property from a bank that had foreclosed on the second phase of a high quality townhome development in atlanta consisting of townhomes and five additional home sites 
in the second half of  the company completed the sale of all townhomes and home sites and generated profits of million 
while the scope and size of this project was not significant  it is an indication of opportunities available in this challenged market 
in  the company also took steps to improve its balance sheet 
as of the end of the first quarter  the company s debt to market capitalization ratio had risen to and leverage under the company s credit facility covenants was above 
in order to reduce the company s leverage and to put the company into a position where it was better prepared to act on potential investment opportunities presented by the september market environment  the company raised million in a common equity offering 
the proceeds of the offering were used to pay down debt 
as a result  the company s debt to market capitalization ratio has decreased to as of year end and the company s leverage under its credit facility has declined correspondingly 
the company is currently negotiating an amendment to its credit facility that management believes will provide further relief under certain financial covenants 
during  the company also took steps to reduce expenses as a result of lower levels of development in the current economy 
in the third quarter  the company made the decision to reduce its non property headcount by and to sell its corporate airplane 
the company believes that these actions were necessary to align costs with its smaller corporate platform but believes that it continues to have talent necessary to maintain its existing assets and to take advantage of opportunities presented by this market 
looking into  management expects the company to continue to aggressively liquidate its condominium holdings and to sell some of its non strategic land holdings to further improve its financial position 
management believes that the company can continue to lease its vacant office and retail space in spite of the sluggish recovery 
management believes the leasing of vacant space to be the most significant value creating activity for the company in while management expects the number of new development opportunities to continue to be limited in  the company may selectively commence one or more projects in in analyzing new development opportunities  management will focus on reaching certain pre leasing criteria before commencing new development and anticipates most new development will occur in concert with a joint venture partner 
management expects to invest in distressed real estate projects 
management expects these acquisitions to take the form of underperforming office or retail projects in need of capital to complete and in need of leasing and asset management expertise to lease and operate efficiently 
in addition to projects where the company takes ownership positions  management believes that additional fee development  leasing or management services assignments will also 
table of contents emerge 
however  there is no guarantee that any of these opportunities will materialize or that the company will be able to take advantage of such opportunities 
critical accounting policies 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  and the notes to consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies for the company 
a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment or complex estimation processes 
the company is in the business of developing  owning and managing office  retail and industrial real estate properties  developing and selling multi family residential units  and developing single family residential communities which are parceled into lots and sold to various home builders 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to its long lived assets  including cost capitalization  depreciation and amortization  and impairment of long lived assets including investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  revenue recognition  including residential lot sales  land tract sales  multi family residential unit sales and valuation of receivables  income tax valuation allowances  and accounting for investments in non wholly owned entities 
long lived assets cost capitalization 
the company is involved in all stages of real estate development 
the company expenses predevelopment costs on a project until it becomes probable defined as more likely than not that the project will go forward 
after management determines the project is probable  all subsequently incurred predevelopment costs  as well as interest  real estate taxes and certain internal personnel and associated costs directly related to the project under development  are capitalized in accordance with accounting rules 
if the company abandons development of a project that had earlier been deemed probable  the company charges all previously capitalized costs to expense 
if this occurs  the company s predevelopment expenses could be significantly high in that period because all capitalized predevelopment costs associated with that project would be charged to expense in the period that this change occurs 
the company had approximately million of capitalized predevelopment assets as of december  additionally  determination of when construction of a project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy requires judgment 
in accordance with accounting rules  the company capitalizes direct and related indirect project costs associated with development projects during the construction period 
once a project is deemed substantially complete and held for occupancy  subsequent carrying costs  such as real estate taxes  interest  internal personnel and associated costs  are expensed as incurred 
the company considers projects and or project phases substantially complete and held for occupancy at the earlier of the date on which the phase reached occupancy of or one year from the issuance of a certificate of occupancy 
the company s judgment of the date the project is substantially complete has a direct impact on the company s operating expenses and net income for the period 
depreciation and amortization 
the company depreciates or amortizes real estate assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method of depreciation 
management uses judgment when estimating the life of the real estate assets and when allocating certain indirect project costs to projects under development 
historical data  comparable properties and replacement costs are some of the factors considered in determining useful lives and cost allocations 
if management incorrectly estimates the useful lives of the company s real estate assets or if cost allocations are not appropriate  then depreciation and amortization may not be reflected properly in the company s results of operations 
the company generally amortizes tenant costs over the lease term 
in certain situations  the tenant may not fulfill its commitment under its lease  and the estimated amortization period of those tenant assets could change 
in recent years  some of the company s retail tenants have experienced bankruptcy or have modified the terms of their lease  which resulted in accelerated amortization of tenant costs or a change in the amortization period  thereby directly affecting the current year s net income 
impairment of long lived assets real estate assets 
the company has real estate assets in varying stages of development  ranging from raw land to operating properties 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews its 
table of contents real estate assets for impairment indicators  that include but are not limited to  a decline in a property s leasing percentage  a current period operating loss or negative cash flows combined with a history of losses at the property  a decline in lease rates or market sales prices  an adverse change in tenants industries or other changes in the market 
if management determines that indicators of impairment are present  management performs a further analysis to determine whether an impairment loss is required 
with the recent decline in the housing market and the overall economic downturn  management determined that indicators of impairment were present on several of the company s real estate assets 
therefore  the company evaluated these assets for recoverability 
these analyses require significant judgment on the part of management 
first  a determination of the intent and ability to hold these assets affects the type of analyses performed 
if an asset is considered to be held for use  as described in accounting guidance  the recoverability of the asset is assessed based on the future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  the asset is determined to be impaired  and the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the project s fair value 
if an asset is considered to be held for sale  as described in accounting guidance  the asset is carried at the lower of its carrying amount or its fair value less costs to sell 
the company performs real estate valuation assessments based on current and future market conditions utilizing assumptions which could differ materially from actual results 
these assumptions are highly subjective and susceptible to frequent change 
several examples of these assumptions are enumerated in the next paragraph 
in analyzing the cash flows and fair value of assets with indicators of impairment  management estimates future market rental rates  cash outlays to generate leases  market capitalization rates for residual values and makes various other estimates 
for residential developments  management estimates sales prices  costs to complete development  carry costs and other project level cash flows 
given the current state of the economy and market for real estate  the timing of a market turnaround and rental rates in future years are significant estimates that require considerable judgment 
management reviews similar products in the market in which its assets are held and adjusts its hold period  sales volume  pricing and other factors as it deems necessary 
the cyclical nature of the real estate industry  combined with the current credit market difficulties  the high levels of existing inventories in the locations of the company s assets  consumer confidence  retailer health  employment levels and additional factors  all enter into management s judgment during this analysis 
in addition  the expected use of the company s assets could change over the coming periods as management obtains more information on the market turnaround or adjusts its strategy 
in addition  the discount rates utilized to estimate the fair value of assets can vary greatly based on the risk associated with the asset  which normally is affected by the type of project  the stage of its life cycle and the location of the asset 
the fair value of an asset can materially change if the discount rate changes 
the company recorded impairment charges on several of its real estate projects and certain other assets in and see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
management does not believe any of its other assets are impaired as of december   but will continue to monitor the state of the economy  the validity of the estimates utilized in the company s impairment analyses and the anticipated use and hold period of its assets 
impairment of long lived assets investment in joint ventures 
additionally  management performs an impairment analysis of the recoverability of its investments in joint ventures in accordance with accounting rules 
at each reporting period  management reviews its investments in joint ventures for indicators of impairment 
if indicators of impairment are present for any of the company s investments in joint ventures  management calculates the fair value of the investment 
if the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment  management must determine whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary  as defined 
if management assesses the impairment to be temporary  the company does not record an impairment charge 
if management concludes that the impairment is other than temporary  the company records an impairment charge 
the company recorded impairment charges for several of its investments in joint ventures in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
management uses considerable judgment in determining whether there are indicators of impairment present and in the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the investment 
management also uses judgment in making the determination as to whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
the company utilizes guidance provided by the sec in making the determination of whether the impairment is temporary 
the guidance indicates that companies consider the length of time that the impairment has existed  the financial condition of the 
table of contents joint venture and the ability and intent of the holder to retain the investment long enough for a recovery in market value 
considerable judgment is required by management to make these determinations 
if management incorrectly concludes that an impairment is temporary  the company s financial statements may not include an impairment charge that would have had an adverse impact on its results of operations 
likewise  if management changes its previous conclusion and an impairment is now determined to be other than temporary  the company could be required to record a significant impairment charge 
revenue recognition residential lot  multi family and land tract sales 
in its determination of the gross profit recognized on residential lot  multi family and land tract sales  the company utilizes several estimates 
gross profit percentages are calculated based on estimated sales prices and the estimated costs of the development 
markets for certain products can change over time as the project is selling 
therefore  historical sales prices may not be indicative of the project s prices over its lifetime and sales may not occur at a consistent or predictable rate 
therefore sales price estimates made by management require a high degree of estimation 
the housing market is currently in a severe decline  the severity and duration of which cannot be predicted at this point 
past estimates and assumptions did not predict the magnitude of this decline  nor the current state of the credit markets 
in addition  management must estimate the costs to complete the development of the residential or multi family projects or the cost of the land tract improvements 
if the company s estimated lot  unit or land tract sales prices  timing of sales or costs of development  or any of the other underlying assumptions were to be revised or be rendered inaccurate  it could affect the overall profit recognized on these sales 
valuation of receivables 
receivables  including straight line rent receivables  are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and may be uncollectible in the future 
the company reviews its receivables regularly for potential collection problems in computing the allowance to record against its receivables 
this review process requires management to make certain judgments regarding collectibility  notwithstanding the fact that ultimate collections are inherently difficult to predict 
a change in the judgments made could result in an adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts with a corresponding effect on net income 
in addition  the market for the company s retail tenants was volatile in and the company anticipates there could be more store closings  lease adjustments  bankruptcies and potentially other changes in the lease terms for certain tenants 
this future information  which previously has been difficult to predict  can change past judgments regarding collectibility and  additionally  certain receivables currently deemed collectible could become uncollectible 
income taxes valuation allowance judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
in accordance with accounting rules  a valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset if  based on the available evidence  it is not more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law 
the company periodically assesses the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not realization threshold criterion 
in the assessment  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  its experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
accounting for non wholly owned entities the company holds ownership interests in a number of ventures with varying structures 
management evaluates all of its partnership interests and other variable interests to determine if the entity is a variable interest entity vie  as defined in accounting rules 
if the venture is a vie  and if management determines that the company is the primary beneficiary  the company consolidates the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the vie 
the company reassesses its conclusions as to whether the entity is a vie upon certain occurrences which are deemed reconsideration events under the rules 

table of contents for entities that are not determined to be vies  management evaluates whether or not the company has control or significant influence over the joint venture to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation 
generally  entities under the company s control are consolidated  and entities over which the company can exert significant influence  but does not control  are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
if the company s judgment as to the existence of a vie  the primary beneficiary of the vie  and the extent of influence and control over a non vie is incorrect  the presentation on the balance sheet and the way the results of operations were reflected could be incorrect 
in addition  the conclusion on the accounting for an entity can change as reconsideration events occur 
as time passes from the formation of an entity  the expected results of the entity can vary  which also could change the allocation to the partners 
in  the real estate market suffered declines in certain areas  and this resulted in changing economics at several ventures 
these changes were analyzed  and resulted in three of its joint ventures  which were previously not vies becoming vies glenmore garden villas llc glenmore  handy road associates  llc handy road and terminus  llc 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the accounting for these ventures 
different accounting conclusions may be reached in the future depending on the timing and extent of a market rebound  and certain ventures not previously consolidated could become consolidated entities and vice versa 
the company recognizes on its consolidated balance sheets the partner s share of non wholly owned entities which the company consolidates 
the noncontrolling partner s share of current operations is reflected in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statements of income 
the company has several venture agreements that contain provisions requiring the company to purchase the noncontrolling interest at fair value upon demand or at a future date 
these noncontrolling interests with redemption features  or redeemable noncontrolling interests  are reflected at fair value in a separate line item on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company records the difference between cost and fair value of redeemable noncontrolling interests as an adjustment to stockholders investment as changes in fair value occur 
contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures are recorded as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
this account is subsequently adjusted for the company s share of income or loss from unconsolidated joint ventures  as well as contributions and distributions between the entities 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on the company s balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets on the joint venture s balance sheet is amortized as an adjustment to income from unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset 
discussion of new accounting pronouncements 
in the third quarter of  the financial accounting standard board s accounting standards codification the codification or asc became effective for the company 
the codification is the single source of authoritative accounting principles applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap 
the codification does not change current gaap  but is intended to simplify user access to gaap by providing all the authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place 
as of the effective date  all existing accounting standard documents were superseded 
all subsequent public filings will reference the codification as the sole source of authoritative literature 
in  the company adopted the provisions of the codification regarding the accounting and disclosures for subsequent events 
this new guidance had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company follows the guidelines in asc for determining the appropriate consolidation treatment of non wholly owned entities 
the company will adopt new guidelines effective january   which will modify how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on  among other things  an entity s purpose and design and a company s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
an ongoing reassessment of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a vie  and additional disclosures about a company s involvement in vies  including any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement  will be required 
the company anticipates that these new guidelines will not have a material impact on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents on january   the company adopted new accounting guidance for calculating earnings per share 
under the new guidance  the company is required to reflect unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents in the computation of earnings per share for all periods presented 
the company s outstanding restricted stock has nonforfeitable rights to dividends 
both basic and diluted earnings per share for the all years presented were retroactively adjusted to conform to this presentation 
the company adopted updated accounting guidelines for fair value evaluations effective january  as it relates to financial instruments and  effective january   as it relates to non financial instruments 
the company evaluated certain of its real estate assets and its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for impairment using fair value processes and techniques as outlined in these accounting rules 
the fair value measurements used in these evaluations of non financial assets are considered to be level valuations within the fair value hierarchy in the rules  as there are significant unobservable inputs 
examples of inputs the company utilizes in its fair value calculations are discount rates  market capitalization rates  expected lease rental rates  timing of new leases and sales prices 
results of operations for the three years ended december  general 
the company s financial results have historically been significantly affected by sale transactions and the fees generated by  and start up operations of  real estate developments 
these types of transactions and developments do not necessarily recur 
accordingly  the company s historical financial statements may not be indicative of future operating results

fee income 
fee income is comprised of management fees  development fees and leasing fees for services the company provides for joint ventures in which it has an ownership interest and for third party property owners 
these amounts vary by years  due to the number of contracts with ventures and third party owners and the development and leasing needs at the underlying properties 
amounts are expected to continue to vary in future years based on volume and composition of activities at the underlying properties and changes in the number of properties managed 
fee income decreased million between the and periods 
the majority of the decrease is due to a development fee of million recognized in the third quarter of this fee was earned on a contract the company assumed in an acquisition of an entity several years ago 
pursuant to the contract  the company would share in certain proceeds from the sale of a project that the prior entity developed in texas 
this project was sold and the fee earned by the company in the third quarter of management fees  including expense reimbursements  and leasing fees fluctuate as contracts are gained and lost and from the rollover of leases at the properties 
the sum of these two items did not change significantly between and fee income increased million between and the increase in fee income between years is primarily the result of the receipt of the million development fee discussed above 
partially offsetting the increase was a decrease of  in development fees related to amounts the company paid and was reimbursed on behalf of the ft 
gillem contract 
the company recognized these fees in and none in  as this contract was assumed by weeks robinson when the company exited the industrial development business 
also partially offsetting the increase was a decrease of million in leasing fees earned in compared to due to changes in the level of rollover and activity at the underlying properties for which the company performs leasing services 
management fees  including expense reimbursements  did not change significantly between and multi family residential sales and cost of sales 
multi family residential sales increased million between and cost of sales increased approximately million between and the change in sales and cost of sales is due to the following closing of units and five completed pads in at the brownstones at habersham project resulting in a million increase in sales and a million increase in cost of sales 
the company purchased and completely liquidated this project in  closing of units at terminus place in compared to units in resulting in a million increase in sales and a million increase in cost of sales 
see section below on impairment loss for additional discussion of terminus place  and closing of units at north market  a multi family project in asheville  north carolina that increased sales by million and cost of sales by million 
the company acquired this project in in satisfaction of a note receivable from the developer 
see section below on impairment loss for additional discussion of north market 
in  the company substantially completed construction and closed the sales of units at terminus place  which caused the increase in sales and cost of sales between and residential lot and outparcel sales and cost of sales 
residential lot and outparcel sales increased  between and and decreased million between and residential lot 
table of contents and outparcel cost of sales increased million between and and million between and residential lot sales and cost of sales the company s residential lot business consists of projects that are consolidated  for which income is recorded in the residential lot and outparcel sales and cost of sales line items  and projects that are owned through joint ventures in which the company is a partner temco and cl realty for which income is recorded in income from unconsolidated joint ventures 
residential lot sales decreased  for consolidated projects between and and million between and the numbers of lots sold were as follows consolidated projects temco cl realty total residential lot cost of sales decreased  between and and decreased million between and the change in residential lot sales and cost of sales was partially due to the number of lots sold during the periods and partially to fluctuations in gross profit percentages used to calculate the cost of sales for residential lot sales in certain of the residential developments 
demand for residential lots has been low in recent years as a result of general market conditions and limited demand in the company s and its ventures principal markets of texas  florida and metropolitan atlanta 
builders  the primary customers for such residential lots  have a general oversupply of inventory in the company s markets and are working to reduce inventory levels before they consider buying additional lots 
many builders are also in financial distress because of current market conditions 
in addition  limited availability of credit for home buyers and homebuilders make it difficult to obtain financing for purchasers 
management is closely monitoring market developments but is currently unable to predict when markets will improve 
management expects these market conditions to continue to negatively impact residential lot sales and have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations until such time as the residential lot markets improve 
the company cannot currently quantify the effect of the current slowdown on its results of operations in and beyond 
on a quarterly basis  the company analyzes its consolidated land and lot holdings in accordance with asc by reviewing these assets for indicators of impairment 
if there are indicators of impairment  the company analyzes the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by assets as it considers substantially all of these assets to be held for use 
given the continuing uncertainty in the residential market  there can be no guarantee that the company will not record an impairment charge on its consolidated projects in the future  although no impairments on consolidated projects have been taken in  or for discussion of impairments at the joint venture and investment in joint venture level  see the income from unconsolidated joint ventures section below

this uncertainty is the result of the continued decline in the housing market which directly impacts crec s residential land and multi family businesses 
based on current projections of income or loss at crec  the company does not anticipate recognizing a provision for or a benefit from income taxes in the near term 
not recognizing income tax benefit in the company s financial statements will negatively affect the company s net income and funds from operations  which in turn affects calculations of compliance under the company s debt covenants

table of contents discontinued operations 
accounting rules require that certain properties that were sold or plan to be sold be treated as discontinued operations and that the results of their operations and any gains on sales from these properties be shown as a separate component of income in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
the differences between the years are due to the number and type of properties included as discontinued operations in each year

funds from operations 
the table below shows funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo and the related reconciliation to net income available to common stockholders for the company 
the company calculated ffo in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition  which is net income available to common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and gains or losses from sales of depreciable property  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis 
ffo is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental measure of an equity reit s operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has been fundamentally beneficial  improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
company management evaluates operating performance in part based on ffo 
additionally  the company uses ffo and ffo per share  along with other measures  to assess performance in connection with evaluating and granting incentive compensation to its officers and key employees

table of contents liquidity and capital resources 
general 
the company s financing strategy is to fund its development activities with proceeds from bank credit facilities  construction loans  permanent loans secured by its properties  sales of mature assets  contribution of assets to joint ventures  and the issuance of preferred or common stock and or convertible bonds 
the tightening of the credit markets  combined with the overall economic downturn in the last several years  has made obtaining some forms of these sources of capital more difficult 
management believes that certain adverse capital raising conditions may continue in and is not able to predict when the market will become more favorable from a capital raising standpoint 
however  the company completed a common stock offering of million shares in september  and raised over million in proceeds 
the company has relatively low debt maturities in the conditions that have led to the tightening credit markets have also led to a decline in new development opportunities for the company 
therefore  while the sources of funds have become limited  the company s capital needs have also decreased

the company is currently in compliance with its financial covenants

the fixed rate debt obligations limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates  and generally are mortgage loans secured by certain of the company s real estate assets 
the company does not have a significant level of consolidated fixed rate mortgage debt maturing in  and therefore does not have high exposure for the refinancing of its mortgage debt in the near term 
at december   the company had million of fixed rate debt outstanding including floating rate borrowings with fixed rates under interest rate swaps discussed below at a weighted average interest rate of 
the company believes the average interest rate on its fixed rate mortgage debt is less than current market rates 
in addition  the company believes that the loan to value ratio that it has received in previous debt arrangements is higher than what the company would be able to obtain in today s marketplace  and  therefore  it would receive a lower loan amount for a similar type property mortgage loan 
in addition  lenders have been resistant in the current market in some situations to offer mortgage financing at all  and therefore  the company could have exposure in finding lenders willing to enter into new mortgage financings 
the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on its variable rate facilities and loans 
the company s credit and term facilities bear interest at libor plus an applicable spread 
libor did not change significantly between december  and december  however  the company has mitigated a portion of its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps 
the company has an interest rate swap on its term facility with a notional amount of million to fix the term facility s variable base rate of libor at through august  the maturity date of the term facility 
in  the company entered into two million interest rate swaps against its other floating rate  libor based borrowings at and through october in  the company terminated the swap and all but million of the swap 
the company believes it has counterparty risk under these swaps  but such amount is limited 
the company also has two smaller variable rate debt instruments  for total variable rate debt of million  which bears interest at a weighted average interest rate of as of december  the company believes that interest rates it would incur under current market conditions would be higher if it were to enter into similar financial instruments in today s market 
the company pays a spread above libor on its credit and term facilities  which spread is calculated based on certain ratios detailed in the credit facility agreement 
the company believes that the spread that it would incur above a variable reference rate would be higher if it entered into similar variable facilities today than the spreads the company is required to pay under the current credit and term facilities 
the company also may not be provided the same capacity under a facility arrangement in the current market and may face stricter covenant restrictions 
based on the company s average variable rate debt balances in  excluding the portion that was fixed under swap agreements  interest expense  before capitalization to projects under development  would have increased by approximately million in if these interest rates had been higher 

table of contents the following table summarizes the company s market risk associated with notes payable as of december  it includes the principal maturing  an estimate of the weighted average interest rates on those expected principal maturity dates and the fair values of the company s fixed and variable rate notes payable 
fair value was calculated by discounting future principal payments at estimated rates at which similar loans would have been obtained at december  the information presented below should be read in conjunction with note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the company did not have a significant level of notes receivable at december   and the table does not include information related to notes receivable 
twelve months ending december  thereafter total fair value in thousands notes payable fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate includes credit and term facilities at interest rates fixed under swap agreements for the term of those agreements 
interest rates on variable rate notes payable are equal to the variable rates in effect on december
