management s overview dreams  inc  headquartered in plantation  florida is a utah corporation which was formed on april   and has evolved into the premier vertically integrated licensed sports products firm in the industry 
this has previously been accomplished  in part  via organic growth and strategic acquisitions 
our continuing pursuit of this dual strategy should result in our becoming a principal leader and a consolidator in this highly fragmented industry 
we believe our senior management and corporate infrastructure is well suited to acquire both large and small industry competitors

revenues not material to the overall consolidated results 
organic growth key components of our organic growth strategy include building brand recognition  improving sales conversion rates both in our stores and web sites  continuing our execution of multi channel retailing under our fansedge brand  aggressively marketing our web syndication services  which has met with early success  exploring additional distribution channels for our products  and cross pollinating corporate assets among our various operating divisions 
management believes that there remain significant benefits to cross pollinating the various corporate assets and leveraging the vertically integrated model that has been constructed over the years 
in particular  we have had success with the marketing of our products on line via fansedge 
com and the complement of each of our web properties 
the company s sales associated with these e commerce initiatives have grown from  in to  in  placing it at number in  number in  number in  and number in of the largest internet retailers in the nation ranking is forthcoming 
this remains the fastest growing area of the company and will remain its primary focus 
the company has drawn on a complete spectrum of competencies it developed to support its flagship online brand  fansedge 
this has allowed the company to leverage the investments made during the past several years by marketing a proven range of services to third parties that include  managed hosting  custom site design and development  customer service  order fulfillment  purchasing  inventory management  marketing  merchandising  and analytics and reporting 
the company calls the compilation of e commerce services described above  web syndication and believes there are significant growth opportunities that exist in the marketplace 
our current web syndication portfolio consists of some of the best known brands and properties in the country  including jc penney  aol sports  majestic athletic and the philadelphia eagles  to name a few 
commencing in june and continuing throughout the fall of last year  we opened six fansedge stores in the greater chicago  il area 
this was in support of our multi channel retailing strategy  whereby we market a single brand via multiple channels 
we are pleased with the results to date of our fansedge brick mortar stores 
they have performed well during the slow economy as we believe they offer approachable price points for the consumer 
they cross market with the on line fansedge 
com site and our fansedge catalogue 
the stores also benefit by a high tech inter active kiosk used in each of the six fansedge stores 
logo 
table of contents during the year ended december   the company closed five under performing field of dreams stores westfarms  pier  scottsdale fashion  fashion valley  north bridge and has closed three more during the first quarter of we will continue to monitor the results of the existing stores to ensure that they are providing us with the desired results 
our proprietary e commerce platform has also enabled us to fuel a state of the art in store interactive kiosk for ordering products 
these kiosks are in each of the new fansedge stores and are providing a unique shopping experience for our customers by allowing them to access the entire company portfolio of more than  product offerings 
in fact  for  we saw an average of contribution to the individual store sales from the kiosks 
in addition  we are experiencing higher conversion rates on line in the chicago market for our fansedge 
com site due to the brand recognition provided by the physical stores presence throughout the chicago land area 
the company believes it can seek joint venture deals with national retailers who are seeking to add a broader range of merchandising options to their customers by placing our kiosks within their store footprint 
in october  we installed our kiosks in six philadelphia eagles team stores in the greater philadelphia market 
we believe this expansion of our revenue producing footprint will serve us well as we navigate our business models through the challenging economy and look to distinguish ourselves from our competitors 
objective our overall objective is twofold  to become the premier multi channel retailer in the team licensed products industry under our fansedge brand  and become the leading online syndicator for sports related properties 
analysis we review our operations based on both our financial results and various non financial measures 
management s focus in reviewing performance begins with growth in sales  margin integrity and operating income 
on the expense side  with a majority of our sales being achieved as an on line retailer of licensed sports products  we spend a disproportionate amount of our operating expenses in internet marketing 
therefore  we continuously monitor the return on investment of these particular expenses 
non financial measures which management reviews include unique visitors to our web sites  foot traffic in our stores  sales conversion rates and average sold unit prices 
we believe the implementation of our multi channel retailing strategy will strengthen our fansedge brand in the marketplace  and that we are well positioned to capture increased activity of on line retail purchases 
industry experts and analysts state that currently  only of all retail sales are being conducted on line and are anticipated to increase 
with the continued growth of our web syndication business model which grew from clients in  to clients in  and revenues from syndication growing from  in to over  in  we are leveraging the company s investment in its broad inventory by offering the items to multiple sites simultaneously 
this should improve our inventory turnover  increase our absorption rates and reduce inventory carrying costs 
historically  the fourth quarter of the fiscal year october to december has accounted for a greater proportion of our operating income than have each of the other three quarters of our fiscal year 
this is primarily due to increased activities as a result of the holiday season 
we expect that we will continue to experience quarterly variations and operating results principally as a result of the seasonal nature of our industry 
management continues to seek ways to shift expenses from the non holiday quarters to the busier holiday quarter in order to improve cash flow 
other factors also cause a significant fluctuation of our quarterly results  including the timing of special events  the general popularity of a specific team that plays in a championship or an individual athlete who enters their respective sports hall of fame  the amount and timing of new sales contributed by new web syndication accounts  new stores  the timing of personal appearances by particular athletes and general economic conditions 
additional factors may cause fluctuations and expenses  including the costs associated with the opening of new stores  the integration of acquired businesses and stores into our operations  the general health of the economy  and corporate expenses to support our expansion and growth strategy 
conclusion we set ourselves apart from other companies with our diversified product and services line  our proprietary e commerce platform  as well as our relationships with sports leagues  agents and athletes 
management believes we can continue to capture market share and become a consolidator in the highly fragmented licensed sports products industry  especially on line 
we are continuing to review our operational expenses and examining ways to reduce costs on a going forward basis 
with the slow economy  we continue to manage our capital conservatively and analyze each of our commitments to identify areas where we can improve the profitability and or cash flow of our business

table of contents use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the determination of the lower of cost or market adjustment for inventory  sales returns  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the recoverability of long lived and intangible assets  the determination of deferred income taxes  including related valuation allowances  the accrual for actual  pending or threatened litigation  claims and assessments  and assumptions related to the determination of stock based compensation in an on going basis  the company reviews its outstanding customer receivables for collectability 
adjustments to the allowance account are made according to current knowledge 
additionally  management reviews the composition of its inventory no less than annually 
reserves are adjusted accordingly 
on a quarterly basis  the company also evaluates its ability to realize its deferred tax assets and whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary 
the company has both goodwill and other long lived intangible assets which are not amortized 
as prescribed by the fasb  the company evaluates the carrying value of these assets for impairment 
significant economic changes may require the company to recognize impairment 
as of december   no impairment has been necessary  yet the company has taken a write down to goodwill in the amount of due to the closing of stores previously acquired that had goodwill associated with the original purchase during the second quarter of management believes that the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity collectibility of accounts receivable the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimates of the creditworthiness of its customers  current economic conditions and historical information  and  in the opinion of management  is believed to be an amount sufficient to respond to normal business conditions 
should business conditions deteriorate or any major customer default on its obligations to the company  this allowance may need to be significantly increased  which would have a negative impact upon the company s operations 
the company s current allowance for doubtful accounts is december  december  accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable  net reserves on inventories the company establishes a reserve based on historical experience and specific reserves when it is apparent that the expected realizable value of an inventory item falls below its original cost 
a charge to operations results when the estimated net realizable value of inventory items declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for declines in value 
adjustments are made to the reserve based on a number of factors  such as  players changing teams  falling out of favor with the public  incurring an injury  etc 
these negative situations may impact valuation 
however  dynamics that could increase inventory value  like the death of an athlete  do not result in writing up of inventory values 
the company s current reserve for inventory obsolescence is december  december  inventory reserves for inventory obsolescence inventory  net income taxes significant management judgment is required in developing the company s provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
the company evaluates quarterly its ability to realize its deferred tax assets and adjusts the amount of its valuation allowance  if necessary 
the company provides a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets when it believes that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
the company has prepared an analysis based upon historical data and forecasted earnings projections to determine its ability to realize its net deferred tax asset 
after consideration of all the evidence  both positive and negative  management has determined that a valuation allowance of as of december  and as of december   was necessary 

table of contents goodwill and unamortized intangible assets in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic intangibles goodwill and other goodwill subsequent measure  the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill as of december of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair value 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds it implied fair value 
the company s evaluations of the carrying amount of goodwill were completed as of december  in accordance with topic  resulted in no impairment losses 
during the quarter ended june   the company closed one of its retail stores 
as a result of the store closing  the company wrote off approximately of goodwill recorded in the original acquisition of this store in november of revenue recognition the company recognizes retail including e commerce sales and web syndication sales and wholesale distribution revenues at the later of a the time of shipment or b when title passes to the customers  all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
retail revenues and wholesale distribution are recognized at the time of sale 
return allowances  which reduce gross sales  are estimated using historical experience 
revenues from the sale of franchises are deferred until the company fulfills its obligations under the franchise agreement and the franchised unit opens 
the franchise agreements provide for continuing royalty fees based on a percentage of gross receipts 
management fee revenue related to the representation and marketing of professional athletes is recognized when earned and is reflected net of its related costs of sales 
the majority of the revenue generated from the representation and marketing of professional athletes relates to services as an agent 
in these arrangements  the company is not the primary obligor in these transactions but rather only receives a net agent fee 
revenues from industry trade shows are recognized at the time of the show when tickets are submitted for autographs or actual product purchases take place 
in instances when the company receives pre payments for show autographs  the company records these amounts as deferred revenue 
the company partnered in a corporate rebate program with a national consumer goods retailer 
the company issued rebate coupons for which it was pre paid of the coupon value 
certificates redeemed through march   were recognized as revenue in the period 
additionally  a breakage model was projected for the program s eight month term  based upon redemption totals redeemed through april   the program s termination date 
thus  the company recognized breakage revenue over the seven months september march  of the program 
the balance of certificates redeemed during the program s last month april  were relieved from deferred revenue and recognized in our manufacturing wholesale revenues for the quarter ended june  the company had approximately in orders not yet shipped as of december

should the company determine that a valuation reserve is necessary  it would have a material impact on the company s operations 
the company has prepared an analysis based upon historical data and forecasted earnings projections to determine its ability to realize its net deferred tax asset

these factors raised substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
such doubt was alleviated during due to the receipt of all necessary waivers from the bank  as well as effective implementation of management s plans to reduce its operating expenses and capital expenditures  restructure its commitments  convert its existing inventory into cash and conservatively manage its cash resulting in positive cash flows from operations and a return to profitability

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we do not currently have any trading derivatives nor do we expect to have any in the future 
we have established policies and internal processes related to the management of market risks  which we use in the normal course of our business operations 
interest rate risk 
we have interest rate risk  in that borrowings under our credit facility with comerica bank are based on variable market interest rates 
as of december   we had  of variable rate debt outstanding under our credit facility with comerica bank 
presently  the revolving credit line bears interest at the prime rate plus a margin 
a hypothetical increase in our credit facility s weighted average interest rate of per annum for the year ended december  would correspondingly decrease our pre tax earnings and our operating cash flows by approximately intangible asset risk 
we have a substantial amount of intangible assets 
we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
as a result of our periodic evaluations  we may determine that the intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values  which could result in material changes that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position 
although at december  we believed our intangible assets were recoverable  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
we continue to monitor those assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
