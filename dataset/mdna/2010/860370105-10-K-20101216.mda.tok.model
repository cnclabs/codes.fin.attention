for additional information  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item personalization 
our market research indicates that consumer preferences are shifting towards more personalized memorial services and merchandise for traditional burials as well as cremations 
in response to these changing preferences  we trained our funeral arrangers and sales counselors company wide to be more proficient in 
table of contents their ability to offer our customers a broad range of options  stressing our ability to design a personalized service that reflects the special interests and accomplishments of the deceased 
we also changed the way our product offerings are displayed at our locations  making it easier for our customers to appreciate the many options available to them 
we implemented this custom funeral planning program in all of our funeral homes and have begun the process of refreshing the training in order to keep our professionals up to date on our wider selection of merchandise and services 
we hope through this program to provide greater value to our families  leading to higher revenue per event and improved customer satisfaction 
enhanced cremation offerings 
a significant trend in the united states is an increasing preference of consumers for cremation 
in fiscal years  and  percent  percent and percent  respectively  of the funeral services we performed in our operations were cremations 
according to industry estimates  percent of funeral services in the united states during resulted in cremations  and cremations are expected to represent percent of funeral services in the united states by the year all of our funeral homes offer cremation products and services 
while the average revenue for a cremation service is generally lower than that of a traditional full service funeral  we have found that these revenues can be substantially enhanced by our emphasis on customization 
for example  in addition to a personalized memorial service to celebrate the life of the deceased  an enhanced cremation may include a casket  an urn and a niche in a mausoleum or columbarium in which to place the remains 
we continue to market our products and services to address the rising demand for cremations 
in late fiscal year  we hired a vice president of cremation and in early fiscal year  we hired a senior vice president of cremation  both with extensive industry and cremation experience  to support our current operations and sales teams in growing cremation revenue and profits 
during fiscal year  we began a program of improving our cremation property and merchandise product offerings 
we intend to improve our ability to satisfy the needs of those interested in cremation  for example by making them aware of memorialization options in our cremation gardens and columbariums 
we have alternative service firms  generally located on the west coast  that serve primarily cremation customers 
these firms are generally located in leased premises and have lower overhead than traditional funeral homes 
these firms primarily offer direct cremations with limited additional products and services 
although death care arrangements at these locations are typically less expensive than services at a traditional funeral home  it is not our goal to be the low price leader in these markets 
e commerce 
during fiscal year  we began using the internet to create new sales channels and new consumer relationships  and are continuing that initiative 
while we did not earn significant revenue from this activity in  we anticipate that our revenue and profits from this activity will increase 
during fiscal year  we improved the internet websites of our funeral home and cemetery locations 
many people access our websites to obtain information about services for a deceased relative or friend  and often read an obituary or sign a guest book 
we have added to our websites certain products and services that can be purchased to support the family of the deceased  including sending meals and flowers  making personal photobooks  and creating permanent online memorials 
visitors to the websites can also make travel arrangements online and buy books on grief management and related topics 
we earn a commission from third party vendors for any sales made on our websites 
management 
we have an experienced management team 
many of our regional managers owned and operated their own funeral homes and cemeteries and joined us when we acquired their business 
in addition  we have a senior management team with experience both in the industry and outside of the industry  which we believe allows us to introduce innovations effectively and improve the efficiencies of our existing businesses 
centralized support services 
our shared services center  which we opened in  was developed for the standardization and centralization of all of our facilities administrative and support processes such as accounting  management reporting  payroll  trust administration  contract processing  accounts payable processing  accounts receivable collection and other services 
it allows us to decrease our costs without diminishing service by creating significant savings on items such as trust administration fees  travel expenses  office supplies  overnight delivery and long distance telephone services 
continuous improvement 
we have taken steps over the last four years to improve our purchasing and processing efficiencies 
for example in  we had four geographic operating divisions  including four division presidents  four divisional chief financial officers and four divisional offices 
in  we instituted a companywide 
table of contents centralized purchasing department to leverage our size and negotiate more favorable supplier and vendor contracts 
during  we implemented a new companywide financial software system and in a new payroll system 
in  we eliminated our separate geographic operating divisions 
we implemented a companywide image scanning system  and a new contract processing industry specific software system  that will serve as a platform for a new point of sale system being implemented in fiscal years and also  over the last two years  we implemented a new supplier invoice processing system that has streamlined the way we route  code and approve invoices for payment 
during  we established a continuous improvement department to work solely on these efforts 
we expect that these new systems and processes will improve productivity over time  and  as we look at our opportunities for growth  we expect to leverage the efficiencies that we have achieved 
financial information about industry and geographic segments 
for financial information about our industry segments for fiscal years  and  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item business strategy our business strategy aims to improve our revenues  profitability and cash flow by implementing our long term strategic plan  which has three components our best in class initiative  our new invention initiative and our manage for cash  invest for growth initiative 
we also aim to improve our operating efficiencies  increase our cremation revenues and effectively deploy our cash flow 
improve rooftop performance through our best in class initiative 
during fiscal year  we completed the initial implementation of the best in class component of our strategic plan 
the initiative is designed to improve the performance of all of our rooftop locations  by repositioning us from more decentralized practices to more standardized best in class practices 
we have given all managers the same key metrics by which they can measure their performance  and have provided tools to facilitate the sharing of best practices by key metrics across the organization 
for example  key metrics include the number of funeral calls and amount of preneed sales 
if funeral calls or preneed sales are below expectations at a particular location  our program provides suggestions taken from our best performing locations that the manager can use to help grow funeral calls and preneed sales 
we are also looking at locations that are not producing acceptable levels of profitability to determine if changes can be made to achieve best in class results or if divestiture is the more prudent option 
the ultimate goal is organic growth and increased profitability 
part of best in class includes operational improvements 
during  we established a continuous improvement department to coordinate our increased focus on improving our processes 
this effort aims to eliminate waste and inefficiency  produce more timely and accurate information for management  and improve productivity over time 
for examples of improvements in our operating efficiencies  see operations continuous improvement 
additionally through our best in class initiative  we are focused intently on improving our revenues from cremation customers 
we have hired new management devoted solely to this effort and intend to continue to devote significant resources to it 
for additional information  see operations enhanced cremation offerings 
we are also working to expand our third party affiliations 
introduce new related revenue sources through our new invention initiative 
the new invention component of our strategic plan seeks to generate new tangential growth opportunities not tied to the growth of our base business 
an example of our progress with this initiative is our investment  along with other industry participants  in an internet start up company called tributes 
com 
tributes 
com offers consumers a means to create meaningful and lasting remembrances that either complement or substitute for traditional newspaper obituary notices 
previously  our locations incurred labor costs for preparing obituary notices  but did not receive any compensation from the publications that receive a fee for publishing the notice 
tributes 
com is intended to allow us to capture market share in the existing obituary notice revenue stream in each of the communities in which we operate  and to increase that revenue stream by offering additional memorialization options 
while tributes 
com is still a start up company  we believe it will have significant benefits to our company  the industry and the families we serve 
additionally  during fiscal year  we began using the websites of our businesses to create new sales channels 
for additional information  see operations e commerce 

table of contents finally  we are managing for cash  investing for growth 
this includes strengthening our balance sheet  supporting our base businesses  growing through prudent acquisitions and supporting new invention 
the acquisition component of our strategic plan is to acquire businesses and implement our best in class practices in them 
we will evaluate acquisition opportunities that make sense for our business strategy at prices we believe will result in satisfactory returns to our shareholders 
deploy cash flow to improve shareholder returns 
during the last five fiscal years  we have generated more than million each year in cash flow from operations 
as an indication of our board s confidence in our company s solid balance sheet and ability to continue to generate cash flow  our board increased our annual cash dividend by percent to per share in september during fiscal years and  we repurchased million and million  respectively  principal amount of our outstanding senior convertible notes at a significant discount to their par value 
since the inception of the debt repurchase program in fiscal year  we have repurchased the senior convertible notes at million less than face value and have produced million of annual cash interest savings 
during fiscal year  we also repurchased million shares of our stock under our stock repurchase program for approximately million 
during fiscal year  we plan to complete the construction of one additional stand alone funeral home and one funeral home which is part of a combination operation 
we will continue to evaluate the use of our cash to pay dividends  repurchase debt and stock  invest in our strategic initiatives  construct funeral homes on cemeteries of unaffiliated third parties or in strategic locations and make acquisitions of or investments in death care or related business  with a view towards choosing the best opportunities to enhance long term shareholder returns 
the death care industry industry consolidation 
death care businesses in the united states have traditionally been relatively small  family owned enterprises that have passed through successive generations within the family 
the decade of the s witnessed a trend of family owned firms consolidating with larger organizations  but this trend slowed dramatically in as the number of consolidators participating in the acquisition market declined  those that remained generally applied significantly tighter pricing criteria  and many potential sellers withdrew their businesses from the market rather than pursuing transactions at lower prices 
our industry continues to be characterized by a large number of locally owned  independent operations  with approximately percent of industry revenue being generated by independently owned operations 
we estimate that our industry  which consists of approximately  funeral homes and  cemeteries in the united states  collectively generates approximately billion in annual revenue 
large public death care companies have also experienced consolidation 
equity corporation international  previously the fourth largest public death care company  merged with service corporation international sci in also in  the loewen group  inc  at the time the second largest death care company  entered into bankruptcy proceedings 
loewen emerged from bankruptcy as alderwoods group  inc in and was subsequently acquired by sci in november in march  sci acquired keystone north america  inc  the fifth largest death care company in north america 
during the s  we grew rapidly primarily through acquisitions of funeral homes and cemeteries both domestically and abroad  financed by new equity and debt 
we ceased our acquisition activity in and developed strategies for improving our cash flow and reducing restructuring debt 
during fiscal years through  we completed our transitional strategies of improving our cash flow  restructuring and reducing our debt and selling our foreign assets 
during fiscal years through  we sold underperforming assets  refinanced and further reduced our debt and implemented new strategies to improve operations 
during fiscal years  and  we focused on our new long term strategic plan and on implementing new business systems to further improve operations 
we believe  at the appropriate pricing  that growing our organization through acquisitions can again be a good business strategy  as it will enable us to enjoy the important synergies and economies of scale from our existing infrastructure 
importance of tradition  barriers to entry 
we believe it is difficult for new competitors to enter existing markets successfully by opening new cemeteries 
the barriers to entry are lower in the funeral business 
entry into the cemetery market can be difficult due to several factors 
because families tend to return to the same cemetery for 
table of contents multiple generations to bury family members  it is difficult for new cemeteries to attract families 
additionally  mature markets  including many of the metropolitan areas where our cemeteries are located  are often served by an adequate number of existing cemeteries with sufficient land for additional plots  whereas land for new cemetery development is often scarce and expensive 
regulatory complexities and zoning restrictions also make entry into the cemetery market difficult 
finally  development of a new cemetery usually requires a significant capital investment that takes several years to produce a return 
continuing need for products and services  increasing number of deaths 
there is an inevitable need for our products and services 
although the number of deaths in the united states will reflect short term fluctuations  deaths in the united states are expected to increase at a steady  moderate pace over the long term 
according to the united states bureau of the census  the number of deaths in the united states is expected to increase by approximately percent per year  from million in to million in furthermore  the average age of the population in the united states is increasing 
according to the united states bureau of the census  the united states population over years of age is expected to increase by approximately percent per year  from million in to million in we believe the aging of the population is particularly important because it expands our target market for preneed sales  as persons over the age of are the most likely group to make preneed funeral and cemetery arrangements 
growing demand for cremation 
a significant trend in the united states is an increasing preference of consumers for cremations 
the trend toward cremations has been a significant concern for traditional funeral home and cemetery operators because cremations have typically included few  if any  additional products or services other than the cremation itself 
we are focused intently on improving our revenues from cremations 
we have hired new management devoted solely to this effort and intend to continue to devote significant resources to it 
for additional information  including information about our strategies to address this trend  see operations enhanced cremation offerings above 
competition our funeral home and cemetery operations generally face intense competition in local markets that typically are served by numerous funeral home and cemetery firms 
we also compete with monument dealers  casket retailers  low cost funeral providers and crematories  and other non traditional providers of limited services or products 
discount retailers have begun marketing caskets at prices that are sometimes substantially lower than what we offer 
consumers also can now buy caskets in funeral supply stores and directly from manufacturers  as well as over the internet 
market share for funeral services and cemetery property is largely a function of goodwill  family heritage and tradition  although competitive pricing  professional service and attractive  well maintained and conveniently located facilities are also important 
market share for funeral and cemetery merchandise is largely a function of price 
extensive marketing through media advertising  direct mailings and personal sales calls has increased in recent years  especially with respect to the sale of preneed funeral services 
regulation our funeral home operations are regulated by the federal trade commission the ftc under the ftc s trade regulation rule on funeral industry practices  cfr part the funeral rule  which went into effect on april   and was revised effective july  the funeral rule defines certain acts or practices as unfair or deceptive and contains certain requirements to prevent these acts or practices 
the preventive measures require a funeral provider to give consumers accurate  itemized price information and various other disclosures about funeral goods and services and prohibit a funeral provider from misrepresenting legal  crematory and cemetery requirements  embalming for a fee without permission  requiring the purchase of a casket for direct cremation  and requiring consumers to buy certain funeral goods or services as a condition for furnishing other funeral goods or services 
on september   representative bobby l 
rush d 
ill 
introduced hr to direct the ftc to draft regulations to extend the funeral rule to cemeteries  crematories and sellers of caskets and other funeral merchandise and to require certain disclosures with respect to preneed sales of funeral services or funeral goods 
the bill was reported favorably by the energy and commerce committee on july   and an estimate of its 
table of contents cost was submitted by the congressional budget office on september  the full house of representatives has not voted on this bill at this time 
we cannot predict the effect this legislation might have on us if passed 
our operations are also subject to extensive regulation  supervision and licensing under numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations 
for example  state laws impose licensing requirements for funeral homes and funeral directors and regulate preneed sales including our preneed trust activities 
our embalming facilities are subject to stringent environmental and health regulations 
we have a department that monitors compliance  and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the funeral rule and all such laws and regulations 
federal  state and local legislative bodies and regulatory agencies frequently propose new laws and regulations  some of which could have a material effect on our operations and on the death care industry in general 
we cannot predict the outcome of any proposed legislation or regulation or the effect that any such legislation or regulation might have on us 
employees as of october   we employed approximately  persons including approximately  full time employees  and we believe that we maintain a good relationship with our employees 
approximately of our employees are represented by labor unions or collective bargaining units

risk factors cautionary statements our business is subject to significant risks 
we caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future  could affect  our actual consolidated results and could cause our actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the goals and expectations expressed in the forward looking statements in this report and in any other forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
risks related to our business our earnings from our trusts can be reduced by declines in stock and bond prices and interest and dividend rates  which can have a significant adverse effect on our gross profit  net earnings and cash flows 
because of our preneed sales activities and the related state trusting requirements that accompany preneed sales  our business is impacted by changes in financial markets 
we maintain three types of trusts preneed funeral merchandise and services  preneed cemetery merchandise and services and cemetery perpetual care 
our trust assets are generally invested in a mix of equity and fixed income securities  and dividend and interest earnings and investment gains and losses are affected by financial market conditions that are not within our control 
generally  declines in market performance reduce the earnings in our trusts and reduce our earnings and cash flow 
in addition  any significant or sustained investment losses could result in there being insufficient funds in the trusts to cover the cost of delivering services and merchandise in the future and result in there being less funds available to defray the costs of cemetery maintenance 
any such deficiency would have to be covered by operating cash flow  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition  our subsidiary  iti  earns trust management fees based on the fair market value of the trusts managed  therefore  declines in the fair market value of the assets in the trusts decrease the amount of fees we collect and record for trust management 

table of contents in fiscal years  and  cemetery perpetual care trust earnings  funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trust earnings and iti trust management fees comprised percent  percent and percent of our revenue  respectively  and percent  percent and percent of our gross profit  for each respective year 
during fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal year  we experienced significant declines in the market value of our trust portfolio  consistent with overall market declines during that time period 
during fiscal year  our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts experienced a total return of percent  and our cemetery perpetual care trust experienced a total return of percent 
however  these improved returns did not restore all of the market value lost during fiscal year and early on october   the aggregate market value of our trust portfolio was million  and on october   it was million 
declines in our perpetual care trust earnings and in revenue for fees we earn for managing our trusts impact current revenue  while earnings on preneed funeral merchandise and services and preneed cemetery merchandise and services are allocated to the underlying contracts and recognized as revenue when the underlying products or services are delivered 
during fiscal year  we recognized million more in revenue than we did in fiscal year from trust related activities  or million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year by comparison  in fiscal year  we recognized million from trust related activities 
based on current market conditions as of october   we believe the revenue from trust earnings recognized on delivery of preneed services and merchandise  cemetery perpetual care earnings and trust management fees for fiscal year would be about the same as for fiscal year if market conditions further deteriorate or we experience additional realized losses  trust related revenue would likely further decrease 
the preneed contracts we manage are long term in nature  and we believe the trust investments will appreciate in value over the long term 
however  whether they will appreciate and over what time period are unknown 
additional information regarding our trusts and related risks are described in the risk factors that follow 
earnings in preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts may be reduced by declines in stock and bond prices and will be reduced by declines in interest and dividend rates  resulting in lower future revenues and cash flows  and potential contract impairment charges 
declines in earnings in our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts can cause a decline in our reported future revenues and cash flows 
with respect to these trusts  we defer recognition and generally withdrawal of dividends  interest income and realized earnings until the underlying product or service is delivered 
realized gains and losses generally have no immediate impact on our revenues  margins  earnings or cash flow  except to the extent there are tax consequences as described later in these risk factors 
dividends  interest income and realized gains and losses are allocated to the underlying contracts and will affect the amount of future revenue recognized  and cash withdrawn  at the time the specific contract is performed 
in our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts  at october   the fair market value of the investments in the trusts of million was million lower than our cost basis of million 
in most of our trusts  unrealized gains and losses are not allocated to individual contracts  in accordance with our trust agreements  however  as gains and losses are realized  they are allocated to the underlying contracts and will affect the amount of earnings we recognize and cash we withdraw at the time the contracts are ultimately performed 
as of october   we had million in earnings that have been realized and allocated to contracts that we will recognize in the future when the underlying contracts are performed 
therefore  significant unrealized losses in these trusts  if they do not recover over time  can limit future earnings available to us 
for fiscal years and  funeral trust earnings included in our reported revenue amounted to million  and cemetery merchandise and service trust earnings amounted to million and million  respectively 
if the fair market value of these trusts were to decline below the estimated costs to deliver the underlying products and services  we would record a charge to earnings to record a liability for the expected losses on the delivery of the associated contract 
as of october   no such charge was required 
for additional information  see note m to the consolidated financial statements included in item realized capital losses in preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts for which we are the grantor  if we have or expect insufficient offsetting capital gains  can cause increases in our current period effective tax rate and a reduction of our current period reported net earnings and a reduction in operating cash flows in future periods 

table of contents approximately one half of the october  fair market value of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts are trusts for which we are the grantor 
for these trusts unlike the remaining trusts for which the customers are the grantors  we retain the income tax characteristics of all earnings as realized in the trust 
for example  capital gains and losses in the trusts are capital gains and losses on our tax returns 
in addition  we must recognize these earnings currently for tax purposes  while for book purposes they are deferred until the contract is performed 
for fiscal years and  the trusts for which we are the grantor realized net losses for book purposes of million and million  respectively 
realized capital losses in the trusts for which we are the grantor  if we have or expect insufficient offsetting capital gains  can require us to record a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset capital loss carryforward  which increases our current period effective tax rate and reduces our current period reported net earnings 
during fiscal year  we recorded a tax valuation allowance of million related to capital losses realized in our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts for which we are the grantor for tax purposes 
we recorded an additional million tax valuation allowance in fiscal year and were able to reduce the allowance by million in fiscal year essentially  the current period valuation allowance reflects the fact that  if we cannot generate capital gains in the future against which to use the tax benefit of the capital loss which is limited to five years  when we perform the contract  we will recognize more income and pay higher taxes for tax purposes than we will for book purposes 
this tax relationship does not occur with respect to trusts for which the customer is the grantor  because all of their earnings are service revenue and thus ordinary income to us  and we do not recognize the revenue for either tax or book purposes until the underlying contract is performed 
as of october   we have approximately million remaining in unrealized losses in trusts for which we are the grantor  hypothetically  if all of these losses were realized at once  this would have resulted in an additional valuation allowance of approximately million  assuming a projected tax rate of percent 
we currently have only a limited amount of embedded capital gains in our trusts 
also  we have utilized all previous capital gains recorded in tax year and prior tax years to offset capital losses carried forward from earlier years 
accordingly  if we experience additional realized losses in these trusts and do not have or expect to have future capital gains available within or outside the trusts to offset these losses  we would record additional valuation allowances and related reductions of net income 
earnings in cemetery perpetual care trusts may be reduced by declines in stock and bond prices and will be reduced by declines in interest and dividend rates  resulting in lower current and potentially future revenues and cash flows 
in addition  we may be required to fund realized net capital losses in these trusts  which would have a negative effect on our earnings and cash flow 
pursuant to cemetery perpetual care contracts and laws  a portion  generally percent to percent  of the proceeds from cemetery property sales is deposited into perpetual care trusts 
the income from these trusts  which have been established in most jurisdictions in which we operate cemeteries  is used for maintenance of those cemeteries  but principal must generally be held by the trust in perpetuity 
the statutory provisions that create and regulate these trusts differ from state to state  as do the regulatory interpretations of the provisions 
the trusts are reviewed regularly by the respective state regulatory authorities 
we currently recognize all dividend and interest income earned and  in states where it is permitted  realized net capital gains generated by cemetery perpetual care trusts 
we are currently utilizing some of the cash that could be withdrawn from the trusts to satisfy our funding obligation resulting from previously realized capital losses  which is discussed below 
the remaining cash withdrawn is used to defray the costs of cemetery maintenance 
therefore  declines in these eligible distributable earnings in cemetery perpetual care trusts would cause a decline in cash flows 
likewise  sustained declines in these earnings would reduce future revenues and cash flows 
as a result  we would need to devote more of our cash flow from other sources to continue to maintain our cemeteries at the same level 
for fiscal  earnings in these trusts contributed million to cemetery revenue  which includes million in capital gains 
unless current market conditions improve substantially  we expect to report earnings from the trusts in the future consistent with fiscal year which is lower than we have historically earned 
in our cemetery perpetual care trusts  at october   the fair market value of our investments of million was million lower than our cost basis of million 
if we realize losses in our cemetery 
table of contents perpetual care trusts and the fair market value of the trust assets is less than the aggregate amounts required to be contributed to the trust  some states may require us to make cash deposits to the trust to cover the net realized loss or may require us to stop withdrawing earnings until future earnings cover the net realized loss 
in those states where we have withdrawn realized net capital gains in the past  regulators may seek replenishment of the realized net capital losses either by requiring a cash deposit to the trust or by prohibiting or restricting withdrawals of future earnings until they cover the loss 
as of october   million was recorded for the estimated probable funding obligation 
as of october   we had net unrealized losses of million in the trusts in these states 
because some of these trusts currently have assets with a fair market value less than the aggregate amounts required to be contributed to the trust  any additional realized net capital losses in these trusts may result in a corresponding funding liability and increase in cemetery costs 
in those states where realized net capital gains have not been withdrawn  due to the different laws and our practices in those states  we do not believe that we will be required to replenish the realized net capital loss  and have not recorded a funding obligation  however  it is possible that regulators may disagree with our conclusion  and future funding obligations may exist 
as of october   the realized net capital loss in these trusts was million  and the unrealized loss was million 
our distributions from cemetery perpetual care trusts include net realized capital gains on investment sales in states where permitted 
if regulations in these states are changed to no longer permit withdrawal of realized capital gains  our cemetery perpetual care trust eligible distributable earnings may be reduced in the future  which would reduce our earnings and cash flows 
in states where permitted  we withdraw and recognize as revenue net realized capital gains on investment sales in cemetery perpetual care trusts 
during fiscal year  we recognized and withdrew million of net realized capital gains in cemetery perpetual care trusts 
currently  our portfolio mix in these states is more heavily weighted to investments that potentially generate capital gains  such as equities 
in states where we do not withdraw capital gains  our portfolio mix is more heavily weighted to fixed income type securities 
we are currently transitioning all cemetery perpetual care trusts to a more diversified asset allocation that emphasizes higher levels of current income while preserving capital 
if states where capital gains are currently permitted to be withdrawn make changes in legislation or regulations to not allow capital gains to be withdrawn  our future revenues and cash flow may be reduced from historical levels until we are able to replace some or all of the investments that potentially generate capital gains with ones that generate more ordinary income such as fixed income securities 
given current economic conditions and market values  we may not be able to make that shift quickly without triggering capital losses that could require additional funding obligations 
reduced market values of preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and cemetery perpetual care trusts will also reduce our trust management fees 
the fees that our subsidiary  iti  collects for managing the trusts are based on the fair market value of the trusts as determined by quoted market prices 
thus as market values decline  the earnings iti collects and the cash we withdraw for managing the trusts is also reduced 
to the extent market values do not improve  we will earn less in iti fees than we have historically earned 
during fiscal years  and  iti trust management fees collected were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our trust portfolio is invested in various sectors  some of which may be more susceptible to additional adverse impact from the current economic environment 
as of october   approximately percent of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trust portfolios and percent of our cemetery perpetual care trust portfolios are invested in the financials sector 
for the preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trust portfolio financial sector investments  approximately percent was invested in preferred stock  percent in fixed income securities and percent in common stock investments 
for the cemetery perpetual care trust portfolio financial sector investments  approximately percent was invested in preferred stock  percent in fixed income securities and six percent in common stock investments 
the current economic environment may result in greater declines to the fair market value of our investments in this and other sectors as compared to the performance of our overall trust portfolio 
table of contents and or market benchmarks  including the s p index 
each sector has particular risks associated with it  and depending on our asset allocation  sector mix  company specific information and future economic events  our portfolio could be at risk for further decline 
for additional information  see the section titled preneed backlog  trust portfolio and cash impact of sales included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item a weakened economy could decrease preneed sales 
a reduction in discretionary spending could also decrease amounts at need customers are willing to pay  and could cause third party insurance providers that fund our insurance funded preneed funeral contracts to experience financial difficulties 
a weakened economy that causes customers to reduce discretionary spending could cause  and we believe has caused  a decline in preneed sales  and could also decrease the amounts at need customers are willing to pay 
declines in preneed cemetery property sales and average revenue per at need event would reduce current revenue 
declines in preneed funeral and cemetery service and merchandise sales would reduce our backlog and could reduce our future revenues and market share 
a weakened economy could also impact our customers ability to pay  causing increased delinquencies  increased bad debt and decreased finance charge revenue which would reduce future earnings and cash flow 
a weakened economy could also increase costs related to sales force turnover and commissions we are unable to recoup as contract cancellation rates increase 
if a contract is cancelled before collecting a specified amount  the related commission is charged back to the sales counselor 
if the sales counselor is no longer employed by us when the contract is cancelled  we are often unable to recoup that commission 
some of the preneed funeral contracts we sell are funded by life insurance or annuity contracts issued by third party insurers 
the net amount of these contracts that have not been fulfilled as of october  was million 
these contracts are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet  but we include them when we discuss our anticipated backlog or anticipated future revenue from preneed funeral sales 
approximately percent of these contracts have been funded by forethought life insurance company 
if forethought or other insurance companies that have issued policies to our customers experience financial difficulties  our potential future revenue associated with these contracts  and commissions we would receive from selling these types of contracts in the future  could be at risk 
for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies for insurance funded preneed funeral contracts  see note i to our consolidated financial statements included in item continued economic weakness and financial and stock market declines could reduce future potential earnings and cash flows and could result in future goodwill impairments 
as of october   goodwill amounted to million  consisting of million in the funeral segment and million in the cemetery segment 
our cemetery segment tends to be more sensitive to goodwill impairments because it has a heavier reliance on preneed sales which are impacted by changes in consumer sentiment and customer discretionary income 
if current economic conditions worsen causing decreased revenues and increased costs or if the current economic conditions result in additional companies in which the trust portfolio is invested in filing for bankruptcy  we may have a triggering event which could result in further goodwill impairments 
servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt depends on our ability to generate cash flow 
we have a senior secured revolving credit facility due in  on which no amounts were drawn as of october   and million in fixed rate long term debt becoming due in through we believe that our current level of cash on hand  projected cash flows from operations and available capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our debt service and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future  although we will need to refinance the senior secured revolving credit facility and other long term debt as they become due 
our ability to generate cash  to a significant extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on our meeting the financial covenants in our debt 
table of contents agreements 
our business may not generate cash flow from operations  and future borrowings may not be available to us under our senior secured revolving credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund other liquidity needs 
as a result  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our debt on favorable terms  or at all 
any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our same store funeral call volumes have not increased for a number of years due to many factors  such as the number of deaths and competition in our markets  our ability to identify changing consumer preferences and various other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our same store funeral call volumes have not increased for a number of years due to many factors described elsewhere in this report  including the number of deaths and intense competition in our markets  and our ability to identify changing consumer preferences 
from fiscal years to  we experienced same store funeral call volume changes of percent  percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to increase same store funeral call volumes over the long term 
declines in same store funeral calls can adversely affect revenues and profits if not offset by increases in average revenue per call or alternative sources of revenue 
price competition could reduce market share or cause us to reduce prices to retain or recapture market share  either of which could reduce revenues and margins 
our funeral home and cemetery operations generally face intense competition in local markets that typically are served by numerous funeral homes and cemetery firms 
we have historically experienced price competition primarily from independent funeral home and cemetery operators  and from monument dealers  casket retailers  low cost funeral providers and other non traditional providers of services or products including  in recent years  internet providers 
from time to time  this price competition has caused us to lose market share in some markets 
in other markets  we have had to reduce prices  thereby reducing profit margins in order to retain or recapture market share 
increased price competition in the future could further reduce revenues  profit margins and backlog and potentially impact our annual goodwill impairment analysis 
discount retailers sell caskets at prices substantially lower than prices we offer 
consumers also can now buy caskets in funeral supply stores and directly from manufacturers  as well as over the internet 
competition from these sources could reduce our casket sales  which could adversely affect funeral revenues and margins 
increased advertising and better marketing by competitors  as well as increased offering of products or services over the internet  could cause us to lose market share and revenues or cause us to incur increased costs or to decrease prices in order to retain or recapture market share 
in recent years  the marketing of preneed funeral services through television  radio and print advertising  direct mailings and personal sales calls has increased 
extensive advertising or effective marketing by competitors in local markets could cause us to lose market share and revenues or cause us to incur increased marketing costs 
in addition  competitors may change the types or mix of products or services offered 
these changes may attract customers  causing us to lose market share and revenue or to incur costs necessary to respond to competition by varying the types or mix of products or services offered by us 
also  increased use of the internet by customers to research and or purchase products and services could cause us to lose market share to competitors offering to sell products or services over the internet 
if we are not able to respond effectively to changing consumer preferences  our market share  revenues and profitability could decrease 
future market share  revenues and profits will depend in part on our ability to anticipate  identify and respond to changing consumer preferences 
we may not correctly anticipate or identify trends in consumer preferences  or we may identify them later than our competitors do 
in addition  any strategies we may implement to address these trends may prove incorrect or ineffective 
increased preneed sales may have a negative impact on current cash flow and earnings 

table of contents preneed sales of cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services  which are generally paid on an installment basis  are generally cash flow negative initially  primarily due to the commissions and other costs to acquire the sale and the fact that a portion of the sales proceeds is required to be placed into trusts or escrow accounts 
we will continue to invest a significant portion of cash flow in preneed acquisition costs  which reduces cash flow available for other activities  and  to the extent preneed activities are increased  cash flow would be further reduced  and our ability to service debt could be adversely affected 
increased costs  including potential increased health care costs  may have a negative impact on earnings and cash flows 
we may not be successful in maintaining our margins and may incur additional costs 
for example  in the past  we have experienced increased property and casualty insurance costs primarily as a result of hurricanes and natural disasters 
on march   the patient protection and affordable care act became law  and one week later  the health care and education reconciliation act of became effective  together enacting comprehensive health care reform in the united states 
the legislation is likely to increase our health care costs 
many provisions of the law that could impact our business will not become effective until  or later  and require implementation through regulations that have not yet been promulgated 
accordingly  the costs and other effects of the legislation  which may include the cost of compliance and potentially increased costs of providing for medical insurance for our employees  cannot be determined with certainty at this time 
we incurred additional costs in fiscal year in conjunction with improving our business systems 
some of the costs impacting our business are largely beyond our control 
to the extent that we are unable to pass these cost increases on to our customers  they will have a negative impact on our earnings and cash flows 
our business is subject to the risk of losses due to hurricanes and other natural disasters 
our company is headquartered in the new orleans metropolitan area  and approximately of our funeral homes and of our cemeteries  along with our mausoleum construction and sales business  acme mausoleum  are located near the gulf coast in southern texas  louisiana  mississippi  alabama and florida  along the eastern coasts of florida  and north and south carolina and in puerto rico 
these areas are periodically threatened by hurricanes  which can damage our properties  interrupt our business and disrupt the lives of our customers and employees 
we are also at risk for tornadoes at our locations in the midwestern united states and for earthquakes at our locations along the west coast of the united states 
in fiscal year  our business was adversely affected by hurricanes katrina  wilma and rita 
in fiscal year  hurricane ike impacted our houston operations 
our insurance may not protect us from all material losses or expenses incurred in connection with a natural disaster 
we have an estimate included in our deferred revenue liability of approximately million  and we may become aware of new information that would require us to increase that estimated liability 
from time to time  unidentified contracts are presented to us primarily relating to contracts sold prior to the time we acquired certain businesses 
in addition  from time to time  we have identified in our backlog  certain contracts in which services or merchandise have already been delivered 
using historical trends  and statistical analyses  we have recorded an estimated liability for these items of approximately million as of october  to the extent we are made aware of contracts that exceed the estimated liability recorded  or cause us to conclude that we should increase the estimated liability recorded  we would have to record a charge to earnings for the estimated cost to deliver the products and services 
our chairman may have a significant and disproportionate influence on the outcome of election of directors and other matters presented for a vote of shareholders and this control may be exercised in a manner that may conflict with the interests of other shareholders 
as of october   our chairman  frank b 
stewart  jr  held  shares or approximately percent of our outstanding class a common stock and all of the  outstanding shares of our class b common stock 
there is no established public trading market for our class b common stock 
because each share of class b common stock is entitled to votes on all matters presented for a vote by our shareholders  mr 
stewart controls approximately percent of our total voting power  while holding approximately percent of our 
table of contents outstanding equity 
accordingly  mr 
stewart may have a significant and disproportionate influence over the election of directors and other matters requiring the affirmative vote of our shareholders and this control may be exercised in a manner that may conflict with the interest of other shareholders 
additionally  because louisiana law and our articles of incorporation require the affirmative vote of two thirds of the voting power present to approve certain major transactions such as mergers and any amendments to our articles of incorporation  mr 
stewart may have the ability to prevent the consummation of such actions  even if they are recommended by our board of directors and favored by a substantial majority of our shareholders 
we may be unable to repurchase our percent senior notes and our senior convertible notes when required by the holders  or to pay the cash portion of the conversion value upon conversion of our senior convertible notes 
in addition  we are subject to counterparty risk on the call options relating to our senior convertible notes 
upon a change of control of our company as defined in the relevant indenture  holders of our percent senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of their notes for cash at a price equal to percent of the principal amount of the notes repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  upon fundamental change events specified in the relevant indenture  holders of our senior convertible notes may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to percent of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
also  upon conversion of our senior convertible notes  we will be required to deliver to the holders a cash payment equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the notes being converted or the conversion value of the notes 
as a result  we may be required to pay significant amounts of cash to holders of the senior convertible notes upon conversion 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial resources to make these payments when due 
any inability to make these payments would constitute an event of default under the indentures governing these notes and would also cause cross defaults under the terms of our other debt agreements 
concurrently with the sale of our senior convertible notes  we purchased call options with respect to our class a common stock from bank of america merrill lynch international and sold warrants to bank of america merrill lynch financial markets  inc the counterparties obligations to us under the call options and warrants are guaranteed by bank of america merrill lynch co  inc by simultaneously purchasing the call options and selling the warrants  we have effectively increased the conversion premium on the senior convertible notes to percent above the market price of the class a common stock at the time of the offering 
the call options are expected to offset our exposure to dilution from conversion of the senior convertible notes because any shares we would be obligated to deliver to holders upon conversion would be delivered to us by the counterparty to the call options 
this obligation is dependent upon the financial viability of the counterparty and guarantor 
with the uncertainty in the united states financial markets  there are risks that the counterparty and guarantor may not remain financially viable or may seek bankruptcy protection 
if the counterparty and guarantor are relieved of or cannot perform this obligation  then at the time of conversion  we may be required to issue additional shares based upon the initial conversion price of the notes and cause further dilution to our shareholders 
the call options we purchased and the warrants we sold contemporaneously with the sale of our senior convertible notes may affect the trading price of our class a common stock and the value of the senior convertible notes 
the counterparties to the call options we purchased and the warrants we sold may engage in hedging activities and modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to the conversion or maturity of our senior convertible notes  and particularly around the time of any conversion of the notes 
these hedging activities may include purchasing and selling shares of our class a common stock  or other of our securities  or other instruments  including over the counter derivative instruments 
the effect  if any  of these activities on the trading price of our class a common stock or the senior convertible notes will depend in part on market conditions at the time and cannot be reasonably predicted at this time 
any of these activities could adversely affect the trading price of our class a common stock and the value of the senior convertible notes 
for additional information about the call options we purchased and the warrants we sold  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item exercise of the outstanding warrants could dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders 

table of contents concurrently with the sale of our senior convertible notes  we sold warrants expiring in to purchase approximately million shares of class a common stock at per share and warrants expiring in to purchase approximately million shares of class a common stock at per share 
the warrants expiring in may not be exercised prior to the maturity of the senior convertible notes due in  and the warrants expiring in may not be exercised prior to the maturity of the senior convertible notes due in the warrants may be settled in cash at our election 
exercise of the warrants could dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders 
in connection with the fiscal year and repurchases of our senior convertible notes  the number of shares of class a common stock subject to the warrants was reduced to million related to the senior convertible notes due in and million related to the senior convertible notes due in for additional information  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in item increases in interest rates would increase interest costs on any variable rate long term debt and could have a material adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share 
we have no variable rate long term debt agreements besides our senior secured revolving credit facility 
although we have no amounts currently drawn under the credit facility  any amounts borrowed in the future are subject to variable interest rates 
any significant increase in interest rates could increase our interest costs on our variable rate long term debt or indebtedness incurred in the future  which could decrease our net income and earnings per share materially 
our ability to maintain compliance with our covenants under our senior secured revolving credit facility and percent senior notes is dependent upon many factors 
covenant restrictions may also limit our ability to operate our business 
our senior secured revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the percent senior notes contain  among other things  covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries activities 
our senior secured revolving credit facility limits  among other things  our and the guarantors ability to borrow money  pay dividends or distributions  purchase or redeem stock  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  consummate specified asset sales  effect a consolidation or merger or sell  transfer  lease  or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  and create liens on our assets 
in addition  our senior secured revolving credit facility contains specific limits on capital expenditures 
furthermore  our senior secured revolving credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy periodic financial condition tests 
the indenture governing the percent senior notes restricts our and the guarantors ability to create liens on assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions and merge or consolidate with other companies 
our and our subsidiaries future indebtedness may contain similar or even more restrictive covenants 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information on our debt covenants 
these covenants may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
in addition  events beyond our control  including changes in general economic and business conditions  may affect our ability to satisfy these covenants 
we might not meet those covenants  and the lenders might not waive any failure to meet those covenants 
a breach of any of those covenants could result in a default under such indebtedness 
if an event of default under our senior secured credit facility occurs  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
any such declaration would also result in an event of default under the indenture governing the percent senior notes 
for additional information  see liquidity and capital resources included in item the payment of dividends on our common stock in the future is subject to uncertainties 
the declaration of dividends on our common stock in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors each quarter after its review of our financial performance 
our ability to pay dividends is restricted under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item we may not be able to consummate significant acquisitions of or investments in death care or related businesses successfully 
although we have not made any significant acquisitions in recent years  we may in the future 
also  our 
table of contents new invention initiative calls for us to seek to generate new tangential growth opportunities not tied to the growth of our base business 
any such acquisitions and investments have risks 
we may fail to identify suitable candidates  and even if we do  we may not be able to successfully complete the transaction or integrate the new business into our existing business 
we may not be able to find businesses for sale at prices we are willing to pay 
acquisition activity  if any  will also depend on our ability to enter new markets 
due in part to our lack of experience operating or investing in new areas and to the presence of competitors who have been in certain markets longer than we have  such acquisitions or investments may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate 
the application of generally accepted accounting principles to our business is complex  and we have had significant changes in the application of generally accepted accounting principles to our business 
no assurances can be given that we will not face similar issues in the future 
our industry is unusual because we often sell products and services many years prior to the time they are required to be delivered  and we are required by varying state laws to hold customer funds related to these sales in trust until the products and services are ultimately delivered 
the accounting for these unusual features is complex  and in prior years there have been periodic changes in the application of generally accepted accounting principles to our business 
some of these changes have made it difficult to compare results from one period to the next 
such changes have also increased our administrative costs 
we can give no assurances that we will not face similar issues in the future 
risks related to the death care industry declines in the number of deaths in our markets can cause a decrease in revenues 
changes in the number of deaths are not predictable from market to market or over the short term  and reliable statistics on deaths in particular markets can be difficult to obtain 
declines in the number of deaths could cause at need sales of funeral and cemetery services  property and merchandise to decline and could cause a decline in the number of preneed sales being delivered  both of which could decrease revenues 
although the united states bureau of the census estimates that the number of deaths in the united states will increase by approximately percent per year from to  longer life spans could reduce the rate of deaths 
changes in the number of deaths can vary among local markets and from quarter to quarter  and variations in the number of deaths in our markets or from quarter to quarter are not predictable 
however  generally the number of deaths fluctuates with the seasons with more deaths occurring during the winter months primarily resulting from pneumonia and influenza 
these variations can cause revenues to fluctuate 
our comparisons of the change in the number of families served to the change in the number of deaths reported by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc from time to time may not necessarily be meaningful 
the cdc receives weekly mortality reports from cities and metropolitan areas in the united states within two to three weeks from the date of death and reports the total number of deaths occurring in these areas each week based on the reports received from state health departments 
the comparability of our funeral calls to the cdc data is limited  as reports from the state health departments are often delayed  and the cities reporting to the cdc are not necessarily comparable with the markets in which we operate 
we have experienced an increase in the proportion of lower priced  non traditional funeral services and direct cremations  which we believe is part of the continuing national trend toward increased cremation 
our traditional cemetery and funeral service operations face competition from the increasing number of cremations in the united states 
industry studies indicate that the percentage of cremations has steadily increased and that cremations will represent approximately percent of deaths in the united states by the year  compared to percent in in fiscal years  and  percent  percent and percent  respectively  of the funeral services we performed in our operations were cremations  and percent  percent and percent of those were direct cremations  respectively 
a full service cremation  which includes a funeral service  merchandise and memorialization of the remains in a mausoleum or columbarium niche or a burial of the remains  can result in funeral and cemetery revenue and profit margins similar to those of traditional funeral services and burials  although the cemetery property sale revenue would generally be lower 
in contrast  a basic or direct cremation  with no funeral service or casket and no memorialization of the remains  produces no revenues for 
table of contents cemetery operations and lower revenues and profit margins for funeral operations when delivered through a traditional funeral home 
during fiscal years through  we experienced a reduction in the proportion of full service traditional funeral services and cremations and an increase in the proportion of lower priced  non traditional funeral services and direct cremations 
a continuation of this trend would adversely affect the revenues and gross profits of our funeral and cemetery businesses 
to address this trend  we have been intensifying our efforts to market full service cremations and have begun a program of enhancing our cremation memorialization offerings 
in addition  the increasing trend towards cremations in the united states could cause us to lose market share to firms specializing in cremations 
because the funeral and cemetery businesses are high fixed cost businesses  positive or negative changes in revenue can have a disproportionately large effect on cash flow and profits 
funeral homes and cemetery businesses must incur many of the costs of operating and maintaining facilities  land and equipment regardless of the level of sales in any given period 
for example  we must pay salaries  utilities  property taxes and maintenance costs on funeral homes and maintain the grounds of cemeteries regardless of the number of funeral services or interments performed 
because we cannot decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when we experience declines in sales  declines in sales can cause margins  profits and cash flow to decline at a greater rate than the decline in revenues 
changes or increases in  or failure to comply with  regulations applicable to our business could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
the death care industry is subject to extensive regulation and licensing requirements under federal  state and local laws 
for example  the funeral home industry is regulated by the ftc  which requires funeral homes to take actions designed to protect consumers 
state laws impose licensing requirements and regulate preneed sales including our preneed trust activities 
embalming facilities are subject to stringent environmental and health regulations 
compliance with these regulations is burdensome  and we are always at risk of not complying with the regulations 
in addition  from time to time  governments and agencies propose to amend or add regulations  which could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
for example  federal  state  puerto rican and other regulatory agencies have considered and may enact additional legislation or regulations that could affect the death care industry 
several jurisdictions and regulatory agencies have considered or are considering regulations that could require more liberal refund and cancellation policies for preneed sales of products and services  limit or eliminate our ability to use surety bonding  impose or increase trust requirements and prohibit the common ownership of funeral homes and cemeteries in the same market 
if adopted by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate  these and other possible proposals could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  our results of operations  our cash flows and our future prospects 
on september   representative bobby l 
rush d 
ill 
introduced hr to direct the ftc to draft regulations to extend the funeral rule to cemeteries  crematories and sellers of caskets and other funeral merchandise and to require certain disclosures with respect to preneed sales of funeral services or funeral goods 
the bill was reported favorably by the energy and commerce committee on july   and an estimate of its cost was submitted by the congressional budget office on september  the full house of representatives has not voted on this bill at this time

an aggregate of million of our term notes are secured by mortgages on some of our funeral homes  these notes were either assumed by us upon our acquisition of the property or represent seller financing for the acquired property 
as of october   we owned cemeteries covering a total of approximately  acres

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the second largest provider of funeral and cemetery products and services in the death care industry in the united states 
as of october   we owned and operated funeral homes and cemeteries in states within the united states and puerto rico 
we sell cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services both at the time of need and on a preneed basis 
our revenues in each period are derived primarily from at need sales  preneed sales delivered out of our backlog during the period including the accumulated trust earnings or build up in the face value of insurance contracts related to these preneed deliveries  preneed cemetery property sales and other items such as perpetual care trust earnings  finance charges and trust management fees 
we also earn commissions on the sale of insurance funded preneed funeral contracts that will be funded by life insurance or annuity contracts issued by third party insurers when we act as an agent on the sale 
as of november   we adopted guidance regarding the accounting for our and senior convertible notes and applied the change retrospectively for all periods presented 
for further information on the impact of the accounting change on our consolidated statements of earnings and balance sheet  see note and note to the consolidated financial statements included in item in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we sold one small funeral business for a gain of million  net of taxes  which is included in discontinued operations 
for further information on the impact of discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of earnings and balance sheet  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item general by focusing on our long term strategic plan  we maintained a strong balance sheet and improved revenue and earnings during fiscal year we reported earnings from continuing operations of million  or 
per diluted share  and total revenue of million in fiscal year  compared to earnings from continuing operations of million  or 
per diluted share  and total revenue of million in fiscal year we generated million in operating cash flow 
we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our senior convertible notes in the open market at million less than their face value  producing annual cash interest savings of million 
we repurchased million shares of our class a common stock for approximately million through our stock repurchase program 
we yielded a combination of refunds and reductions of income tax payments totaling approximately million primarily due to our tax planning strategies 
our operating results through fiscal year were positively affected by the overall improvement in the economy 
in particular  we experienced a percent increase in merchandise delivered and a percent increase in our cemetery property sales 
during the fourth quarter of  we achieved the highest quarterly merchandise deliveries in two years 
in contrast  net preneed funeral sales declined percent for fiscal year while preneed funeral sales decreased from the prior year  our goal is for preneed funeral sales to exceed preneed maturities  and for fiscal year preneed funeral sales exceeded preneed deliveries by million  or times 
during fiscal year  same store funeral services declined percent 
we continue to face challenges from customers increasing preference for cremation  which has been a significant concern for traditional funeral home and cemetery operators  like us  because cremations have typically included few  if any  additional products or services other than the cremation itself  and can result in lower revenue and profits than traditional services 
we are addressing funeral service volumes and increases in cremations through our best in class initiative  enhanced sales and marketing efforts and our emphasis on personalization 
we are intensifying our efforts to market full service cremations  including better marketing of our memorialization options for our cremation consumers 
in late fiscal year  we hired a vice president of cremation and in early fiscal year  we hired a senior vice president of cremation  both with extensive industry and cremation experience  to support our current operations and sales teams in growing cremation revenue and profits 
in addition  during fiscal year  we began a program of improving our cremation inventory and product offerings 
for the year ended october   we achieved a percent increase in our average revenue per traditional funeral service and a percent increase in our average 
table of contents revenue per cremation service 
additional information about our business and strategies can be found in item business 
throughout the latter part of fiscal year and the early part of fiscal year  the adverse financial market conditions caused a decrease in our revenue from trust related activities 
during fiscal year  we recognized approximately million less revenue from trust related activities than we did in fiscal year due to the improvement in the overall economy  we recognized million more revenue from trust related activities in fiscal year than we did in fiscal year though we have not reached the trust related revenue levels we had prior to the downturn in the overall economy  our trends appear to be improving 
based on current market conditions as of october   we believe our revenues from trust related activities for fiscal year would be consistent with fiscal year with the improvements in the financial markets during  our trust portfolios had a total return of percent in our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and a percent return in our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
during late fiscal  we engaged a new investment consultant to review the portfolio 
we reviewed alternative asset allocation models and selected a new asset allocation that emphasizes diversification and reduces volatility 
as a result  we have taken advantage of the rebound in the financial markets to rebalance the trust portfolio 
in fiscal year  we reduced our exposure to common equities and increased our investment in fixed income securities with the intent to generate a reasonable rate of return with a lower overall volatility for the investments 
we plan to continue to reduce the volatility of our investment portfolio by adjusting our asset allocation as the financial markets improve 
financial summary for fiscal year for fiscal year  net earnings were million compared to net earnings of million for fiscal year fiscal year earnings from continuing operations increased million to million compared to million for fiscal year net earnings for fiscal year included a million net loss on early extinguishment of debt  compared to a million net gain on early extinguishment of debt for fiscal year  related to our open market repurchases of our senior convertible notes during fiscal years and during fiscal year  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our senior convertible notes in the open market at million less than their face value  producing annual cash interest savings of million 
fiscal year included a million charge related to our probable funding obligation related to our perpetual care trusts 
total revenue increased million to million for fiscal year funeral revenue increased million to million from million in fiscal year our same store funeral operations experienced a percent increase in average revenue per traditional funeral service and a percent increase in average revenue per cremation service 
these increases were partially offset by a shift in mix to lower priced cremation services resulting in an overall increase of percent in same store average revenue per funeral service 
the increase in same store average revenue per funeral service was partially offset by a percent decrease in same store funeral services performed  which we believe is generally consistent with industry wide data in our markets 
for the year ended october  we had a percent decrease in net preneed funeral sales 
while preneed funeral sales decreased from the prior year  our goal is for preneed funeral sales to exceed preneed maturities  and for fiscal year preneed funeral sales exceeded preneed deliveries by million  or times 
preneed funeral sales are deferred until the underlying contracts are performed and have no impact on current revenue 
cemetery revenue increased million  or percent  to million primarily due to a million  or percent  increase in cemetery property sales and a million  or percent  increase in cemetery merchandise delivered 
in addition  we experienced a million improvement in the reserve for cancellations and a million increase in cemetery property revenue due to the timing of revenue recognition for cemetery property sales 
consolidated gross profit increased million to million due to an million increase in cemetery gross profit and a million increase in funeral gross profit 
cemetery gross profit was million for fiscal year  and was positively impacted by million of perpetual care withdrawals related to prior year cancellations which we used to offset our deposit requirement 
this compares to million of cemetery gross profit for fiscal year  which included a million charge to record a probable funding obligation related to 
table of contents our perpetual care trusts 
the increase in cemetery gross profit is primarily due to the increase in revenue  as noted above 
corporate general and administrative expenses decreased million to million for fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in training costs related to the implementation of a new business system in the prior year  coupled with a decline in incentive compensation 
we managed our corporate general and administrative expenses more aggressively in fiscal year interest expense decreased million to million for fiscal year primarily due to the significant repurchases of our senior convertible notes in the open market  as previously mentioned 
cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal year we received million of net tax refunds during fiscal year compared to receiving million in net tax refunds in fiscal year in addition  we experienced a change in working capital during fiscal year  partly driven by the million change in receivables due in part to the improved cemetery property sales  which are typically financed 
preneed backlog  trust portfolio and cash impact of sales overview we believe that preneed funeral and cemetery property sales are two of the primary drivers of sustainable long term growth in the number of families served by our funeral homes and cemeteries 
our preneed funeral service and merchandise sales and preneed cemetery service and merchandise sales are deferred into our backlog while our preneed cemetery property sales are recognized currently in accordance with the retail land sale provisions of asc property  plant and equipment 
for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies and how we account for our at need sales  preneed sales and trust earnings  see notes i  j  k  and notes through to the consolidated financial statements included in item backlog we estimate that as of october  and the future value of our preneed funeral and cemetery services and merchandise backlog represented approximately billion of revenue to be recognized in the future as these prepaid products and services are delivered 
this is made up of approximately billion from trust and billion from insurance 
this represents the face value of the backlog taking into account current realized earnings not yet recognized and current unrealized gains and losses plus the earnings that are projected on the funds held in trust and the current face value of insurance contracts 
it assumes no future preneed sales and assumes maturities each year consistent with our historical experience  with the majority of existing contracts expected to mature over the next years 
in addition  in fiscal years and  the analysis assumes a weighted annual return of approximately percent projected from our trusts over the expected life of the contracts and zero percent for increasing death benefits as it is at the discretion of the insurance company 
actual results could differ from our assumptions used in the calculation 
proceeds of these insurance policies may be used by customers for other purposes and are portable to other funeral service providers or for completely separate purposes 
as of october  and october   the value of the preneed backlog  excluding any future earnings on the funds held in trust and any build up in the face value of insurance contracts  but including unrealized earnings and losses on the funds held in trust and realized earnings and losses on the funds held in trust not yet recognized as revenue  was approximately billion and billion  respectively 
supplemental trust portfolio information we maintain three types of trusts and escrow accounts preneed funeral merchandise and services  preneed cemetery merchandise and services and cemetery perpetual care 
the size of the trusts depends primarily upon the level of preneed sales and maturities  the amount of dividend and interest income and investment gains or losses and funds added through acquisitions  if any 
as of october   approximately percent of our portfolio was invested in cash  percent in fixed income securities  percent in preferred stocks  percent in common equities  percent in passive commodity index funds and percent in other investments 
because approximately percent of our total trust 
table of contents portfolio is currently invested in common equities  we would generally expect our portfolio performance to improve if the performance of the overall stock market improves  but we would also expect its performance to deteriorate if the overall stock market declines 
during late fiscal  the company engaged a new investment consultant to review the portfolio 
we reviewed alternative asset allocation models and selected a new asset allocation that is more heavily weighted toward fixed income securities and emphasizes diversification 
as a result  we have taken advantage of the rebound in the financial markets to rebalance the trust portfolio 
throughout fiscal years and  we have reduced our exposure to common equities and have increased our investment in fixed income securities where we intend to generate a reasonable rate of return with a lower overall volatility for the investments 
we plan to continue to reduce the volatility of our investment portfolio by adjusting our asset allocation as the financial markets improve 
the following table presents the overall annual realized return in our domestic trusts for the years to the returns represent interest  dividends and realized capital gains or losses but not unrealized capital gains or losses 
during fiscal year  we experienced positive trends in the overall market and in our preneed and perpetual care trusts 
for the year ended october   our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts experienced a total return  including both realized and unrealized losses  of percent  and our cemetery perpetual care trusts experienced a total return  including both realized and unrealized losses  of percent 
the table below presents the total returns of our trusts including realized and unrealized gains and losses 
funeral and cemetery merchandise and cemetery perpetual services trusts care trusts for the year ended october  for the last three years ended october  for the last five years ended october  in our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts  the fair market value of the investments in the trusts were million and million lower than our cost basis as of october  and october   respectively 
in our cemetery perpetual care trusts  the fair market value of our investments were million and million lower than our cost basis as of october  and october   respectively 
for additional information see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
the preneed contracts we manage are long term in nature  and we believe that the trust investments will appreciate in value over the long term 
we continue to monitor our investment portfolio closely 
as of october  and october   we had million and million  respectively  in earnings that have been realized and allocated to contracts that will be recognized in the future as the underlying contracts are performed 
securities representing unrealized losses totaling million at october  were also in a loss position at october   down from million at the end of the last fiscal year 
based upon our review of the specific underlying securities  we continue to believe that we have the ability and intent to hold these investments for the forecasted recovery period  and  therefore  do not believe the losses on these securities should be realized 
for each of these securities  we evaluate consensus analyst recommendations  ratings from established ratings agencies and overall market performance 
most of our common stocks are part of the s p index and most preferred stocks and corporate bonds had a rating of investment grade at the time of purchase 
we believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents within the trusts  from cash deposits of future preneed sales and cash received from ordinary income to fund future services and allow us to hold these investments until they recover in value 
of the million  percent  or million  were generated by common stock investments 
the market value of these securities represents approximately percent of the market value of the securities in our trust portfolio 
although we cannot predict future stock prices  our management expects that as the overall s p 
table of contents recovers these stocks may recover along with them 
the sectors in which our trust investment portfolio is invested are diversified except as described below 
passive investments such as cash and highly diversified mutual funds represented percent  or million  of fair market value of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services portfolios and percent  or million  of fair market value of our cemetery perpetual care portfolio as of october  investments in the financials sector represented percent  or million of fair market value  of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services portfolios  of which percent was related to preferred stock  percent related to fixed income securities and percent related to common stock investments 
investments in the financials sector represented percent  or million  of our cemetery perpetual care portfolio as of october   of which percent was related to preferred stock  percent related to fixed income securities and percent related to common stock investments 
this sector has unrealized losses of million as of october  in our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts  million of which relate to preferred stock investments 
with respect to our cemetery perpetual care trust portfolio  the financials sector has unrealized losses of million as of october   million of which relate to preferred stock investments 
risks associated with the financials sector include risk of failure of various large financial institutions  changing government regulation  interest rates  cost of capital funds  credit losses and volatility in financial markets 
investments in the information technology sector represented percent  or million  of fair market value of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services portfolios and percent  or million  of fair market value of our cemetery perpetual care portfolio as of october  the information technology sector risks include overall economic conditions  short product cycles  rapid obsolescence of products  competition and government regulation 
we perform a separate analysis to determine whether our preneed contracts are in a loss position 
for fiscal year  none of our preneed contracts were in a loss position 
for additional information  see note m to the consolidated financial statements and overview of critical accounting policies herein 
we generate revenue related to the trusts from investment management fees earned by our subsidiary  iti 
in fiscal year  these fees amounted to million 
these fees are based on the fair market value of the investments in the funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trust portfolio and cemetery perpetual care trusts  and significant changes in the fair market value of the portfolio impact the fees earned 
impact of preneed sales on near term cash the impact of preneed sales on near term cash flow depends primarily on the commissions paid on the sale  the timing of the tax payments on the sale  whether the sale is funded by trust or insurance  the portion of the sale required to be placed into trust and the terms of the particular contracts such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract 
we generally pay commissions to our preneed sales counselors based on a percentage of the total preneed contract price  but only to the extent cash is paid by the customer 
if the initial cash installment paid by the customer is not sufficient to cover the entire commission  the remaining commission is paid from subsequent customer installments 
however  because we are required to place a portion of each cash installment paid by the customer into trust  we may be required to use our own cash to cover a portion of the commission due on the installment from the customer 
accordingly  preneed trust sales are generally cash flow negative initially  but may become cash flow positive at varying times over the life of the contract  depending upon the trusting requirements and the terms of the particular contract 
generally preneed insurance sales are slightly cash flow positive 
commissions related to preneed funeral and preneed cemetery services and merchandise sales are expensed as incurred 
cash flows related to earnings in our trusts  deposits and withdrawals and related matters and our cemetery perpetual care funding obligations are described in notes  and of the consolidated financial statements 
overview of critical accounting policies 
table of contents the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements included in item we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item deferred revenue and revenue recognition funeral revenue is recognized when funeral services are ultimately performed 
our funeral receivables included in current receivables primarily consist of amounts due for funeral services already performed 
we sell price guaranteed prearranged funeral contracts through various programs providing for future funeral services at prices prevailing when the agreements are signed 
revenues associated with sales of prearranged funeral contracts  which include accumulated trust earnings  are deferred until such time that the funeral services are ultimately performed 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements included in item revenue associated with cemetery merchandise and services is recognized when the service is ultimately performed or merchandise is actually delivered 
revenue associated with preneed cemetery property interment rights is recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provision of asc property  plant and equipment 
under this guidance  revenue from constructed cemetery property is not recognized until percent of the sales price has been collected 
revenue related to the preneed sale of cemetery property prior to completion of its construction is recognized on a percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenue associated with sales of preneed merchandise and services is not recognized until the merchandise is actually delivered or the services are ultimately performed 
see note j to the consolidated financial statements included in item we defer all dividends and interest earned and net capital gains and losses realized by preneed funeral trust and preneed cemetery merchandise trust accounts until the underlying service or the merchandise is delivered 
unrealized capital gains and losses are not allocated to specific contracts 
from time to time  unidentified contracts are presented to us primarily relating to contracts sold prior to the time we acquired certain businesses 
in addition  from time to time  we have identified in our backlog  certain contracts in which services or merchandise have already been delivered 
using historical trends and statistical analysis  we record an estimated net liability for these items 
perpetual care funding obligation certain states allow us to withdraw realized capital gains from cemetery perpetual care trusts  and other states prohibit these withdrawals 
these earnings and related funds are intended to defray cemetery maintenance costs and are recorded as revenue 
in the event that we have been allowed to withdraw realized gains and then realize net losses in the trust  we may determine we have a funding obligation to restore the net realized 
a charge is recorded in the statement of earnings at the time it is considered probable that we will be required to restore the realized losses 
loss contract analysis each quarter we perform an analysis to determine whether our preneed contracts are in a loss position  which would necessitate a charge to earnings 
for this analysis  we add the sales prices of the underlying contracts and realized earnings  then subtract realized losses to derive the net amount of proceeds for contracts as of that particular balance sheet date 
we then consider unrealized gains and losses based on current market prices quoted for the investments  but we do not include future expected returns on the investments in our analysis 
we compare the amount of adjusted proceeds after considering net unrealized gains and losses to the estimated direct costs to deliver the contracts  which consist primarily of funeral and cemetery merchandise costs and salaries  supplies and equipment related to the delivery of a preneed contract 
if a deficiency were to exist  we would record a charge to earnings and a corresponding liability for the expected loss on the delivery of those contracts from our deferred revenue 
due to the positive margins of our preneed contracts and the trust portfolio returns we have experienced in prior years  there is currently sufficient capacity for additional market depreciation before a contract loss would occur 

table of contents variable interest entities we consolidate our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
for a more detailed discussion of our accounting policies including our policy for determining whether a loss in an investment in our trust portfolio should be considered realized and for determining whether impairments in debt securities are temporary or other than temporary  see notes k and through to the consolidated financial statements included in item insurance funded preneed funeral contracts are not recorded on our balance sheet  as described in note i to the consolidated financial statements included in item allowance for doubtful accounts and sales cancellations management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
we establish a reserve for uncollectible installment contracts and trade accounts based on a range of percentages applied to accounts receivable aging categories 
these percentages are based on an analysis of our historical collection and write off experience 
in addition  we establish a reserve for sales cancellations for cemetery property sales based on historical cancellations and recent write off activity 
this reserve is recorded as a reduction in cemetery revenue 
we also establish an allowance for cancellations of insurance and third party commissions based on historical experience for cancellations of insurance contracts within the period of refundability 
these estimates are impacted by a number of factors  including changes in the economy and demographic or competitive changes in our areas of operation 
if circumstances change  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could change by a material amount 
depreciation of long lived assets buildings and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  primarily using the straight line method 
buildings and building improvement items are generally depreciated over a period ranging from to years 
equipment is generally depreciated over the following ranges light equipment  to years  heavy equipment  years  computer equipment  to years  and crematory equipment  to years 
vehicles are generally depreciated over to years 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset 
these estimates of the useful lives may be affected by such factors as changes in regulatory requirements or changing market conditions 
valuation of long lived assets we review the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
this review is based on our projections of anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets to the carrying amount of those assets 
the net carrying value of any assets not fully recoverable would be reduced to fair value 
while we believe that our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows and comparable sales values could materially affect our evaluations 
valuation of goodwill in our determination of reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes  both qualitative and quantitative characteristics are evaluated 
gross margins are analyzed for purposes of determining whether or not our operating regions are considered economically similar 
qualitative factors include the nature of our products and services  consistency of products and services and the delivery of those products and services in our funeral homes and cemeteries  the similarity of class of customers across all locations and regulations in different jurisdictions 
based on our evaluation  we have ten reporting units 
because goodwill impairment tests are applied at the reporting unit level  a change in a reporting unit can have a material effect on the outcome of the test 
see note g to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information 
goodwill of a reporting unit must be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in addition to an annual review  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be greater than its fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment 
table of contents review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
goodwill was allocated to these reporting units based on the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill determined in a business combination 
that is  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
we calculated the fair value  or enterprise value  for each of the reporting units based on a discounted cash flow analysis  as supplemented by comparing them to the trading multiples of companies in our industry and supplier industries calculated as enterprise value divided by ebitda 
we also reviewed multiples used in recent acquisition transactions within the deathcare industry 
in reviewing goodwill for impairment  we first compare the fair value of each of our reporting units with their carrying amounts including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value  we then measure the amount of impairment of the reporting unit s goodwill by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
an impairment charge is recorded when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
this step of our impairment test involves determining estimates of the fair values of our assets and liabilities 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  including if we project lower cash flow in the future for a reporting unit than we projected when we performed our fiscal impairment test  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
our goodwill impairment test involves estimates and management judgment 
we measure fair value based on present value techniques including discounted cash flows 
our discounted cash flow valuation uses projections of future cash flows and includes assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions and may differ from actual future cash flows 
we test our results by comparing them to the trading multiples of companies in our industry and supplier industries calculated as enterprise value divided by ebitda 
we also reviewed multiples used in recent acquisition transactions within the deathcare industry 
in projecting our cash flows  we used growth rates generally ranging from two to five percent in revenues and costs  with the growth in costs slightly below that of revenues  resulting in growth in cash flows of approximately six percent overall 
we adjusted the results for our estimate of the impact of the realized losses in our trusts on our cash flows 
for the discount rate  we used percent  which reflected our weighted average cost of capital determined based on our industry and our supplier industries and capital structure as adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on our market capitalization 
fair value is calculated as the sum of the projected discounted cash flows of the reporting units over the next five years and terminal value at the end of those five years 
the terminal value is calculated as the projected ebitda at the end of the five year period divided by the discount rate minus terminal growth rates ranging from to percent 
we considered a sensitivity analysis of the terminal values and used the midpoint enterprise value as our best estimate 
as of october   none of our reporting units with material goodwill are at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
the following items are reviewed to determine if a valuation allowance is required net operating losses federal  state and united states possessions  capital loss carry forwards and deferred tax assets federal  state and united states possessions 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we include an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the statement of earnings 
approximately one half of the october  fair market value of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts are in trusts for which we are the grantor 
for these trusts unlike the remaining 
table of contents trusts for which the customers are the grantors  we retain the income tax characteristics of all earnings as realized in the trust 
for example  capital gains and losses in the trusts are capital gains and losses on our tax returns 
in addition  we must recognize these earnings currently for tax purposes  while for book purposes they are deferred 
realized capital losses in the trusts for which we are the grantor  if we have or expect insufficient offsetting capital gains  can require us to record a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset capital loss carryforward  which increases our current period effective tax rate and reduces our current period reported net earnings 
essentially  the current period valuation allowance reflects the fact that  if we cannot generate capital gains in the future against which to use the tax benefit of the capital loss which is limited to five years  when we perform the contract  we will recognize more income and pay higher taxes for tax purposes than we will for book purposes 
this tax relationship does not occur with respect to trusts for which the customer is the grantor  because all of their earnings are service revenue and thus ordinary income to us  and we do not recognize the revenue for either tax or book purposes until the underlying contract is performed 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we adopted the guidance on uncertain tax positions in asc income taxes 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we have reviewed our income tax positions and identified certain tax deductions or revenue deferrals that are not certain 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us federal  state and local or non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years before to the extent tax  interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions in the future  amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of tax expense  interest expense or other expense 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change our allowance  which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
estimated insurance loss liabilities we purchase comprehensive general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation insurance coverages structured within a large deductible self insured retention premium rating program 
this program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs and losses covered by these policies but below our deductible 
with respect to health insurance  we purchase individual and aggregate stop loss coverage with a large deductible 
this program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs up to the amount of the deductible  with claims in excess of the deductible amount being covered by insurance 
we also have insurance coverage related to property damage  incremental costs and property operating expenses we incurred due to damage caused by hurricanes and other natural disasters 
our policy is to record such amounts when recovery is probable  which generally means we have reached an agreement with the insurance company 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item we accrue for legal costs related to loss contingencies as the services are provided 
if a settlement is determined to be probable  then an estimate is recorded for the settlement at that time

the effective tax rate for fiscal year was percent compared to percent for fiscal year the decreased rate for fiscal year was primarily due to a tax benefit in fiscal year from the net reduction in the valuation allowance on our capital loss carryforwards and an increased tax benefit from the recognition and utilization of net operating losses in certain states and a us possession

funeral trust earnings recognized in funeral revenue for fiscal years and with respect to preneed contracts delivered were million and million  respectively 
funeral revenue decreased million  or percent  from million for the year ended october  to million for the year ended october  the decrease in funeral revenue is primarily due to a million decline in funeral revenue related to trust activities and a percent  or  event  decrease in our same store funeral services performed  to  events 
we believe the decline is primarily due to a reduced 
table of contents number of deaths in our markets  when compared with the comparable prior year period 
an additional percent of the total decline is due to a  call decline in our west coast operations  resulting from a decrease in low end cremation events 
finally  we experienced a call decline  or percent of the total decline  in funeral services due to an additional day in the second quarter of associated with leap year

cemetery revenue decreased million from million for the year ended october  to million for the year ended october  this decrease is primarily due to a million  or percent  decrease in cemetery property sales  net of discounts  due primarily to current economic conditions 
approximately percent of the decline in cemetery property sales occurred in florida where the current economic environment is having the largest impact 
we also experienced a million decrease in cemetery merchandise delivered and services performed primarily due to a decline in deaths in our markets 
merchandise delivered was

in addition  we experienced a million decrease in cemetery revenue related to trust activities  of which million of the decrease relates to cemetery perpetual care trust earnings 
cemetery gross profit decreased million to million for the year ended october  compared to million for the same period of the decrease in gross profit is primarily due to the decrease in revenue  as noted above  partially offset by a decrease in the estimated probable funding obligation to restore the net realized losses in certain of our cemetery perpetual care trusts which declined from a million charge recorded during fiscal year to a million charge recorded during fiscal year other corporate general and administrative expenses decreased million to million for the year ended october  primarily due to million in fiscal year charges for professional services related to the board s evaluation of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value in connection with our response to an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
we incurred million in net hurricane related charges in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year related to hurricanes katrina and ike 
the net expenses in fiscal years and associated with hurricane katrina primarily relate to the lawsuit we filed against our insurance carriers related to our hurricane katrina claim 
interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended october  primarily due to the repurchase of our senior convertible notes in the open market 
investment and other income  net decreased million to million due primarily to an approximate basis point decrease in the average rate earned on our cash balances 
in light of economic and market conditions  we decided to seek stable investments in money market funds invested in united states treasury securities 
these investments realize a lower return

in fiscal year  we purchased million aggregate principal amount of our percent senior convertible notes due and million aggregate principal amount of our percent senior convertible notes due in the open market  for an aggregate purchase price of million  a substantial discount 
as a result  we recorded a million pre tax net gain on the early extinguishment of debt during the year ended october  the effective tax rate for the year ended october  was percent compared to percent for the same period in the increased rate in fiscal year was primarily due to the million goodwill impairment charge  of which million was non deductible for tax purposes 
this increase was coupled with a million valuation allowance on the unrealized capital loss carryforward of approximately million  net of capital gains  attributable to the realized losses associated with investments of certain trusts which are recognized for tax purposes and deferred for book purposes

liquidity and capital resources general we generate cash in our operations primarily from at need sales  preneed sales that turn at need  funds we are able to withdraw from our trusts and escrow accounts when preneed sales turn at need  monies collected on preneed sales that are not required to be placed in trust and cemetery perpetual care trust earnings 
over the last five years  we have generated annually over million each year in cash flow from operations 
we have historically satisfied our working capital requirements with cash flows from operations 
we believe that our current level of cash on hand  projected cash flows from operations and available capacity under our million senior secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future  although we will need to refinance the senior secured revolving credit facility in and long term debt becoming due in through  as described below 
as of october   we had no amounts drawn on the million senior secured revolving credit facility  and our availability under the senior secured revolving credit facility  after giving consideration to million outstanding letters of credit and the million florida bond  was million 
we also have the ability to request the addition of a new tranche of term loans  an increase in the commitments to the senior secured revolving credit facility or a combination thereof  not to exceed million 
our million senior notes mature on february  and are currently redeemable at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture and described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also have million in senior convertible notes as of october  of which million mature in and million mature in see the table below under contractual obligations and commercial commitments for further information on our long term debt obligations 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we increased our quarterly cash dividend from two and one half cents per share to three cents per share on our class a and b common stock  which amounted to million for fiscal year the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by the board of directors each quarter after its review of our financial performance 
in september  we announced plans to resume purchases of our class a common stock under our million stock repurchase program 
we repurchased million shares under the program for million during fiscal year subsequent to october  through november   we repurchased an additional million shares for million and have million remaining available as of november  repurchases under the program are limited to our class a common stock  and are made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at such times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate  depending upon market conditions and other factors 
during fiscal year  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our senior convertible notes in the open market at substantial discounts and repurchased an additional million aggregate principal amount during fiscal year since inception in fiscal year  we have purchased million aggregate principal amount of our senior convertible notes at million less than face value and have produced million of annual cash interest savings 
we plan to continue to evaluate our options for deployment of cash flow as opportunities arise 
we believe that the use of our cash to pay dividends  construct funeral homes on cemeteries of unaffiliated third parties or in strategic locations  make acquisitions of or investments in death care or related businesses and repurchase debt and stock are all attractive options 
we believe that growing our organization through acquisitions and investments is a good business strategy  as it will enable us to enjoy the important synergies and economies of scale from our existing infrastructure 
we have also redesigned our websites to support e commerce initiatives that will provide new revenue opportunities in the future and are continuing to invest in further improving our business processes 
we regularly review acquisition and other strategic opportunities  which may require us to draw on our senior secured revolving credit facility or pursue additional debt or equity financing 
we plan to spend approximately million in fiscal year to complete the construction of two funeral homes 

table of contents we continue to pursue several tax planning strategies 
during the third quarter of  the internal revenue service approved a change in one of our tax accounting methods that resulted in a combination of refunds and reductions of federal income tax payments totaling approximately million 
of that amount  million was received as a refund in fiscal year  million was received as a refund in the first quarter of  million was used to offset estimated tax payments during fiscal and the remaining million was used to offset future federal income tax payments in the change relates to our tax accounting method for preneed contracts in one state 
for those contracts  we were recognizing income for tax purposes and paying taxes relating to amounts received from customers and placed in trust at the time the cash was received from the customers 
this method relates to approximately million of income that was taxed prior to the actual delivery of the merchandise or services 
the change permits us to defer recognition of income for tax purposes and pay taxes with respect to those amounts until the time the service is actually performed or the merchandise is actually delivered and cash is withdrawn from the trust  which generally aligns our book and tax accounting for these amounts and is consistent with our approach in the other states 
the change essentially allowed us to apply the approximately million reversal of previously reported taxable income to reduce taxable income for fiscal years    and part of we will eventually have to pay federal income taxes with respect to the million as the related preneed contracts are performed in the future 
we received irs approval in fiscal year on five requests for changes in tax accounting methods  which resulted in the deferral of approximately million of taxable income 
these changes increase the current net operating loss to be utilized beginning in to approximately million 
the utilization of this net operating loss will significantly reduce federal income tax payments by approximately million for the next three years beginning in  of which approximately million was used to reduce federal income tax payments in fiscal year we utilized approximately million of this net operating loss in fiscal year these changes primarily relate to our tax accounting methods for preneed cemetery services and preneed funeral merchandise 
these changes permit us to defer the recognition of income for tax purposes and pay taxes with respect to those amounts until the time the service is provided or the merchandise is actually delivered 
we will eventually pay taxes with respect to the million as the related preneed contracts are performed in the future 
we are continuing to review all of our tax accounting methods to determine opportunities to improve our current tax position 
several possible changes are being considered that could result in potential reductions in future tax payments 
at this time  we cannot predict with certainty what  if any  reductions in future tax payments we will obtain 
however  we currently do not expect that these potential reductions in future tax payments  if obtained  will be as substantial as those obtained in fiscal years or cash flow comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal year we received million of net tax refunds during fiscal year compared to receiving million in net tax refunds in fiscal year in addition  we experienced a change in working capital during fiscal year  partly driven by the million change in receivables due in part to the improved cemetery property sales  which are typically financed 
our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash outflow of million for the comparable period in the change is primarily due to million in net purchases of certificates of deposit in fiscal year  offset by a decline in capital expenditures 
in the first quarter of  we entered into a certificate of deposit account registry service program in order to obtain a higher rate of return on our cash balances  while maintaining our fdic insurance protection 
for the year ended october   capital expenditures amounted to million  which included million for maintenance capital expenditures  million for growth initiatives and million related to the implementation of new business systems 
for the year ended october   capital expenditures were million  which included million for maintenance capital expenditures  million for growth initiatives and million related to the implementation of new business systems 
we also purchased a cemetery business in fiscal year resulting in a net cash outflow of million and sold a funeral business in fiscal year resulting in a net cash inflow of million

our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash outflow of million for the comparable period in the change is due in part to a decline in capital expenditures due to a change in our policy to expand our fleet leasing program

the estimated probable funding obligation in the cemetery perpetual care trusts in these states was million as of october  as of october   we had net unrealized losses of million in the trusts in these states 
because some of these trusts currently have assets with a fair market value less than the aggregate amounts required to be contributed to the trust  any additional realized net capital losses in these trusts may result in a corresponding funding liability and increase in cemetery costs 
in those states where realized net capital gains have not been withdrawn  we believe it is reasonably possible but not probable that additional funding obligations may exist with an estimated amount of approximately million  no change has been recorded for these amounts as of october  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  we adopted the required accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions on november  in accordance with this guidance  as of october   we recorded million of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties
