item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
this management s discussion and analysis is intended to help provide an understanding of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of our operations and contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements are not historical facts  but rather are based on current expectations  estimates  assumptions and projections about our industry  business and future financial results 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in this report  including under the caption item a

executive summary overview effective january   dish network completed its distribution to us the spin off of its set top box business and certain infrastructure and other assets  including certain of its satellites  uplink and satellite transmission assets  real estate and other assets and related liabilities 
we currently operate two primary business units i our digital set top box business  and ii our satellite services business 
digital set top box business our digital set top box business designs  develops and distributes digital set top boxes and related products and technology  including our slingbox placeshifting technology  primarily for satellite tv service providers  telecommunication and cable companies and  with respect to slingboxes  directly to consumers via retail outlets 
most of our digital set top boxes are sold to dish network  but we also sell a significant number of digital set top boxes to bell tv in canada  dish mexico and other international customers 
as part of the spin off  dish network contributed sling media  inc  a leading innovator in the digital lifestyle space to us  to complement our existing product line 
slingbox placeshifting technology allows consumers to watch and control their home digital video and audio content anywhere in the world via a broadband internet connection 
our digital set top box business also provides digital broadcast operations including satellite uplinking downlinking  transmission services  signal processing  conditional access management and other services provided primarily to dish network 
we believe opportunities exist to expand our business by selling equipment and services in both the united states and international markets 
as a result of our extensive experience with digital set top boxes and digital broadcast operations  we can provide end to end pay tv delivery systems incorporating our satellite and backhaul capacity  customized digital set top boxes and related components  and network design and management 
during november  we entered into a joint venture for a direct to home  or dth  service in mexico known as dish mexico  s 
de rl de rl  or dish mexico 
pursuant to these arrangements  we provide certain broadcast services and satellite capacity and sell hardware such as digital set top boxes and related equipment to dish mexico 
subject to a number of conditions  including regulatory approvals and compliance with various other arrangements  we committed to provide approximately million of value over an initial ten year period  of which million has been satisfied in the form of cash  equipment and services  leaving million remaining under this commitment 
of the remaining commitment  approximately million is expected to be paid in cash and the remaining 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued amounts may be satisfied in the form of certain services or equipment 
during the year ended december   we sold million of set top boxes and related accessories to dish mexico that are not related to the original commitment associated with our investment in dish mexico 
during december  we entered into a joint venture  to provide a dth service in taiwan and certain other targeted regions in asia 
we own and have joint control of the entity 
pursuant to these arrangements  we sell hardware such as digital set top boxes and provide certain technical support services 
we have provided million of cash  and an million line of credit that the joint venture may only use to purchase set top boxes from us 
as of december   no amounts have been drawn on the line of credit 
dependence on dish network 
we currently depend on dish network for a substantial portion of the revenue for our digital set top box business and we expect for the foreseeable future that dish network will continue to be the primary source of revenue for each of our businesses 
therefore  our results of operations are and will for the foreseeable future be closely linked to the performance of dish network s satellite pay tv business 
in addition  while we expect to sell equipment to other customers  the number of potential new customers for our digital set top box business is small and may be limited by our common ownership and related management with dish network  our current customer concentration is likely to continue for the foreseeable future 
changes in dish network subscriber growth could have a material adverse affect on our digital set top box sales 
in particular  factors that have an adverse affect on dish network may have an adverse impact on us 
to the extent that dish network subscriber growth decreases as a result of weak economic conditions in the united states or otherwise  sales of our digital set top boxes to dish network may decline 
the impact to us of any weakening of dish network subscriber growth may be offset over the near term by an increase in sales to dish network resulting from the upgrade of dish network subscribers to advanced products such as high definition hd receivers  digital video recorders dvrs and hd dvrs  as well as by the upgrade of dish network digital set top boxes to new technologies such as mpeg digital compression technology or slingbox placeshifting technology 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these factors will mitigate any weakening of subscriber growth at dish network 
in addition  although we expect dish network to continue to purchase products and services from us  there can be no assurance that dish network will continue to purchase products and services from us in the future 
we may experience significant pressure on margins we earn on the sale of digital set top boxes and other equipment  including on sales to dish network 
this pressure may be due to economic conditions  advancements in the technology and functionality of digital set top boxes and other equipment 
the margins we earn on sales are determined largely through periodic negotiations that could result in pricing reflecting  among other things  the digital set top boxes and other equipment that best meet our customers current sales and marketing priorities  the product and service alternatives available from other equipment suppliers  and our ability to respond to customer requirements and to differentiate ourselves from other equipment suppliers on bases other than pricing 
our future success may also depend on the extent to which prospective customers that have been competitors of dish network are willing to purchase products and services from us 
many of these customers may continue to view us as a competitor as a result of common ownership and related management with dish network 
if we do not develop relationships with new customers  we may not 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued be able to expand our customer base and our ability to increase or even maintain our revenue will be impacted 
additional challenges for our digital set top box business 
we believe that our best opportunities for developing potential new customers for our digital set top box business over the near term lie in international markets  and we therefore expect our performance in international markets to be a significant factor in determining whether we will be able to generate revenue and income growth in future periods 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain or grow our international business 
in particular  we have noticed an increase in new market entrants  primarily located in asia  that offer low cost set top boxes  including set top boxes that are modeled after our products or products of our principal competitors 
the entry of these new competitors may result in pricing pressure in international markets that we hope to enter 
if market prices in international markets are substantially reduced by such new entrants  it may be difficult for us to make profitable sales in international markets 
furthermore  if we do not continue to distinguish our products through distinctive  technologically advanced features and design  as well as continue to build and strengthen our brand recognition  our business could be harmed as we may not be able to effectively compete on price alone in both domestic and international markets against low cost competitors that are principally located in asia 
if we do not otherwise compete effectively  demand for our products could decline  our gross margins could decrease  we could lose market share  our revenues and earnings may decline and our growth prospects would be diminished 
the economic downturn and tightened credit markets may cause certain suppliers that we rely on to cease operations which  in turn  may cause us to suffer disruptions to our supply chain or incur higher production costs 
our ability to sustain or increase profitability will also depend in large part on our ability to control or reduce our costs of producing digital set top boxes 
the market for our digital set top boxes  like other electronic products  has been characterized by regular reductions in selling prices and production costs 
therefore  we will likely be required to reduce production costs to maintain the margins we earn on digital set top boxes and the profitability of our digital set top box business 
our ability to reduce production costs could be impacted by the economic conditions which could cause inflated pricing as a result of a shortage of available parts 
satellite services business our satellite services segment consists principally of transponder leasing provided primarily to dish network  and secondarily to government entities  internet service providers  broadcast news organizations and private enterprise customers 
we also deliver our vip tv transport service  offering mpeg encoded internet protocol  or ip  streams of video and audio channels to telecommunication companies and small cable operators 
we began operating the satellite services business following the completion of the spin off using our owned and leased in orbit satellites  multiple digital broadcast centers and other transmission assets 
we are also pursuing expanding our business offerings by providing value added services such as telemetry  tracking and control services to third parties 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete against our competitors due to their significant resources and operating history 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra has allocated billion to expand access to broadband services 
of this amount  billion is administered by the rural utilities service 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued rus for deployment of broadband projects in rural  unserved and underserved communities across the united states and billion has been allocated to the national telecommunications and information administration ntia of the united states department of commerce to fund broadband initiatives throughout the u 
s  including unserved and underserved areas 
our proposals for broadband stimulus funds in the first round of funding were not granted 
the agencies have announced a second round of funding that will total several billion dollars 
this will include a set aside of as least million for satellite projects 
we are currently evaluating whether to submit second round applications for funding and we cannot be sure if any such applications will be granted  or that they will be granted on acceptable terms 
if any of our applications are granted and we accept the terms of such grant s  we may become subject to certain regulations promulgated by the agencies 
dependence on dish network 
we currently depend on dish network for a substantial portion of the revenue for our satellite services business 
therefore  our results of operations are and will for the foreseeable future be closely linked to the performance of dish network s satellite pay tv business 
while we expect to continue to provide satellite services to dish network for the foreseeable future  its satellite capacity requirements may change for a variety of reasons  including the launch of its own additional satellites 
any termination or reduction in the services we provide to dish network would increase excess capacity on our satellites and require that we aggressively pursue alternative sources of revenue for this business 
during september  we entered into a ten year satellite service agreement with dish network for capacity on the nimiq satellite 
pursuant to this agreement  dish network will receive service from us on all of the dbs transponders covered by our satellite service agreement with telesat 
dish network began receiving service on of these dbs transponders upon service commencement of the satellite on october  and will receive service on the remaining dbs transponders over a phase in period that will be completed in during november  we entered into a ten year satellite service agreement with dish network for capacity on the quetzsat satellite 
quetzsat is expected to be launched in and will operate at the degree orbital location 
pursuant to this agreement  dish network will receive service from us on of the dbs transponders covered by our satellite service agreement with ses latin america sa ses 
in addition  because the number of potential new customers for our satellite services business is small and may be limited by our relationship with dish network  our current customer concentration is likely to continue for the foreseeable future 
our future success may also depend on the extent to which prospective customers that have been competitors of dish network are willing to purchase services from us 
many of these customers may continue to view us as a competitor given the common ownership and management team we continue to share with dish network 
additional challenges for our satellite services business 
our ability to expand revenues in the satellite services business will likely require that we displace incumbent suppliers that generally have well established business models and often benefit from long term contracts with customers 
as a result  to grow our satellite services business we may need to develop or otherwise acquire access to new satellite delivered services so that we may offer customers differentiated services 
in addition  as our satellite fleet ages  we will be required to evaluate replacement alternatives such as acquiring  leasing or constructing additional satellites  with or without customer commitments for capacity 
however  there can be no assurance that we would be able to develop successful alternative services or the sales and marketing expertise necessary to sell such services profitably 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued adverse economic conditions our ability to grow or maintain our business may be adversely affected by weak global and domestic economic conditions  including wavering consumer confidence and constraints on discretionary purchasing  unemployment  tight credit markets  declines in global and domestic stock markets  falling home prices and other factors that may adversely affect the markets in which we operate 
our ability to increase our income or to generate additional revenues will depend in part on our ability to organically grow our business  identify and successfully exploit opportunities to acquire other businesses or technologies  and enter into strategic partnerships 
these activities may require significant additional capital that may not be available on terms that would be attractive to us or at all 
in particular  current dislocations in the credit markets  which have significantly impacted the availability and cost of financing  specifically in the leveraged finance markets  may significantly constrain our ability to obtain financing to support our growth initiatives 
these developments in the credit markets may increase our cost of financing and impair our liquidity position 
in addition  these developments may cause us to defer or abandon business strategies and transactions that we would otherwise pursue if financing were available on acceptable terms 
furthermore  unfavorable events in the economy  including continued or further deterioration in the credit and equity markets could cause consumer demand for pay tv services and consequently sales of our digital set top boxes to dish network  bell tv and other international customers to decline materially because consumers may delay purchasing decisions or reduce or reallocate their discretionary spending 
future capital sources we primarily rely on our existing cash and marketable investment securities balances  as well as cash flow generated through operations to fund our investment needs 
in addition  we will receive million during the first quarter from dish network for the assignment of a launch contract 
since we currently depend on dish network for a substantial portion of our revenue  our cash flow from operations depend heavily on their needs for equipment and services 
as a result  there can be no assurances that we will always have positive cash flows from operations and should our cash flows turn negative  our existing cash and marketable investment securities balances may be reduced 
in addition  if we are unsuccessful in overturning the district court s ruling on tivo s motion for contempt  we are not successful in developing and deploying potential new alternative technology and we are unable to reach a license agreement with tivo on reasonable terms  we would be required to cease distribution of digital set top boxes with dvr functionality 
in that event  our sales of digital set top boxes to dish network and others would likely significantly decrease and could even potentially cease for a period of time 
furthermore  the inability to offer dvr functionality would place us at a significant disadvantage to our competitors and make it even more difficult for us to penetrate new markets for digital set top boxes 
the adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations if the district court s contempt order is upheld is likely to be significant 
if we are successful in overturning the district court s ruling on tivo s motion for contempt  but unsuccessful in defending against any subsequent claim that our original alternative technology or any potential new alternative technology infringes tivo s patent  we could be prohibited from distributing dvrs 
in that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering dvr functionality and the adverse effect on our business could be material 
because both we and dish network are defendants in the tivo lawsuit  we and dish network are jointly and severally liable to tivo for any final damages and sanctions that may be awarded by the 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued court 
dish network has agreed that it is obligated under the agreements entered into in connection with the spin off to indemnify us for substantially all liability arising from this lawsuit 
we have agreed to contribute an amount equal to our million intellectual property liability limit under the receiver agreement 
we and dish network have further agreed that our million contribution would not exhaust our liability to dish network for other intellectual property claims that may arise under the receiver agreement 
therefore  during the second quarter of  we recorded a charge included in general and administrative expenses dish network on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss of million to reflect this contribution 
we and dish network also agreed that we would each be entitled to joint ownership of  and a cross license to use  any intellectual property developed in connection with any potential new alternative technology 
because we are jointly and severally liable with dish network  to the extent that dish network does not or is unable to pay any damages or sanctions arising from this lawsuit  we would then be liable for any portion of these damages and sanctions not paid by dish network 
any amounts that dish network may be required to pay could impair its ability to pay us and also negatively impact our future liquidity 
if we become liable for any portion of these damages or sanctions  we may be required to raise additional capital at a time and in circumstances in which we would normally not raise capital 
therefore  any capital we raise may be on terms that are unfavorable to us  which might adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and might also impair our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms in the future to fund our own operations and initiatives 
other risks our profitability is affected by our marketable investment securities which are accounted for at fair value 
these securities had a fair value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the fluctuations in fair value of these investments are recorded in unrealized gains losses on investments accounted for at fair value  net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss and directly impact our profitability 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million gain on these investments compared to a million loss for the same period in these investments are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience significant volatility 
the fair value of these investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally  as well as risks related to the performance of the company whose securities we have invested in  their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans  risks associated with their specific industries  and other factors 
our profitability is also affected by costs associated with our efforts to expand our sales  marketing  product development and general and administrative capabilities in all of our businesses 
as we expand internationally  we may also incur additional costs to conform our digital set top boxes to comply with local laws or local specifications and to ship our digital set top boxes to our international customers 
impairments of goodwill  indefinite lived and long lived assets for the year ended december   following periodic assessments of the carrying value of our tangible and intangible assets  we recorded no impairments 
for the year ended december   following periodic assessments of the carrying value of our tangible and intangible assets  we recorded impairments of our amc  amc  amc and 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cmbstar satellites  certain fcc licenses and the fair value of goodwill carried in our digital set top box business  detailed below 
satellites amc casualty loss 
during  amc experienced a launch anomaly and failed to reach its intended orbit 
ses americom subsequently declared the amc satellite a total loss due to a lack of viable options to reposition the satellite to its proper geostationary orbit 
therefore  we have no obligation to make any future monthly lease payments to ses americom with respect to the satellite 
however  we did make up front payments with respect to the satellite prior to launch and recorded capitalized interest and insurance costs related to the satellite 
these amounts  net of insurance proceeds of million  totaled million and were written off during and were attributed to our satellite services segment 
amc and amc impairments 
in connection with the spin off  we assumed satellite lease agreements for amc and amc  two in orbit satellites with substantial unused satellite capacity 
these assets are part of our satellite services business 
these satellites had substantial unused capacity  our initial business plan contemplated that we would generate cash inflows sufficient to support their carrying values 
however  due to fewer opportunities for profitable alternative uses of the satellite capacity and lower demand for satellite services due to the weak economy  we determined that an impairment triggering event had occurred 
based on the results of our impairment analysis  we recorded impairment charges of aggregating million with respect to these satellites  although we continue to explore opportunities to generate revenues from these assets 
cmbstar impairment 
in connection with the spin off  dish network contributed to us a satellite under construction  cmbstar 
in april  we notified the state administration of radio  film and television of china that we were suspending construction of the cmbstar satellite pending  among other things  further analysis relating to efforts to meet the satellite performance criteria and or confirmation that alternative performance criteria would be acceptable 
during the second and third quarters of  we continued to explore remedies and alternative uses for this satellite 
during the fourth quarter of  there were significant adverse change in the business climate and we were unable to secure a commercial agreement for an alternative use 
as a result  we performed an impairment analysis which determined that the undiscounted cash flows would not recover the carrying amount of this satellite 
based on the results of our impairment analysis  we recorded an impairment charge of million with respect to cmbstar 
we continue to explore alternative uses for this satellite  including potentially reconfiguring the satellite and shifting its proposed orbital location in a manner that would be more cost effective than designing and constructing a new satellite 
digital set top business goodwill impairment 
in  the estimated fair value of our reporting units was based on discounted cash flow models derived from internal forecasts 
goodwill carried in our digital set top box business  primarily related to our acquisition of sling media 
assessment of goodwill requires that we consider  among other factors  the fair value of our net assets as compared to our current equity market capitalization 
in the fourth quarter  our stock price was negatively impacted by  among other things  the deteriorating macroeconomic environment and market liquidity and our common stock traded at a discount to our book value  which was an indication of a possible goodwill impairment 
as a result of our impairment analysis  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
notwithstanding the goodwill impairment  we continue to capitalize on the sling s placeshifting technology that allows consumers to watch and control their pay tv content via a broadband internet connection

our historical statements of operations include expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically provided to us by dish network  including  among other things  treasury  tax  accounting and reporting  risk management  legal  internal audit  human resources  investor relations and information technology 
in certain cases  these allocations were made on a specific identification basis 
otherwise  the expenses related to services provided to us by dish network were allocated to us based on the relative percentages  as compared to dish network s other businesses  of headcount or other appropriate methods depending on the nature of each item of cost to be allocated 
pursuant to transition services agreements we entered into with dish network prior to the spin off  dish network has continued to provide us with certain of these services at prices agreed upon by dish network and us for a period of two years from the date of the spin off at cost plus an additional amount that is equal to a fixed percentage of dish network s cost  which is believed to be fair value pricing

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued equipment revenue dish network 
equipment revenue dish network totaled billion during the year ended december   a decrease of million or compared to the same period in this change related primarily to a decrease in unit sales of set top boxes  a decline in average revenue per unit and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in accessory sales 
the decline in average revenue per unit was driven by continued manufacturing efficiencies and a change to one of our component vendor contracts 
this contract change reduced our set top box costs for and  which resulted in a corresponding reduction in revenue of million 
pursuant to the receiver agreement  discussed below  set top boxes are sold to dish network at cost plus a fixed margin resulting in a decline in revenue per unit when lower set top box costs are incurred 
in the near term  we expect dish network to remain the primary customer of our digital set top box business and the primary source of our total revenue 
pursuant to the commercial agreements we entered into with dish network  we are obligated to sell digital set top boxes to dish network through january   although dish network has no obligation to purchase digital set top boxes from us during or after this period 
in addition  if dish network s subscriber growth declines  it may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
equipment revenue other 
equipment revenue other totaled million during the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to the same period in this change resulted primarily from sales of million to dish mexico  and a million increase in sales to bell tv 
although the number of units sold to bell tv increased  the average revenue per unit to bell tv decreased compared to the same period in due to a change in sales mix and as a result of the early amendment to our agreement with bell tv  discussed below 
the sales to dish mexico were in addition to the original commitment associated with our investment in dish mexico 
a substantial majority of our international revenue during the year ended december  was attributable to sales of equipment to bell tv 
in early  we completed a multi year contract extension with bell tv that makes us the exclusive provider of certain digital set top boxes to bell tv 
the agreement includes fixed pricing over the term of the agreement as well as providing future engineering development for enhanced bell tv service offerings 
there can be no assurance that sales to bell tv will continue at historical levels  and any decline could adversely affect our gross margins and profitability 
services and other revenue dish network 
services and other revenue dish network totaled million during the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to the same period in the change was driven primarily by an increase in uplink services provided to dish network related to support for new satellites and new services like hd programming  partially offset by a decrease in transponder leasing and other services provided to dish network 
during october  we entered into a ten year satellite service agreement with dish network for capacity on the nimiq satellite 
pursuant to this agreement  dish network will receive service from us on all of the dbs transponders covered by our transponder contract with telesat 
dish network began receiving service on of these dbs transponders upon service commencement of the satellite on october  and will receive service on the remaining dbs transponders over a phase in period that will be completed in services and other revenue other 
services and other revenue other totaled million during the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to the same period in the change was driven primarily by an increase in transponder leasing provided to customers other than dish network 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cost of sales equipment 
cost of sales equipment totaled billion during the year ended december   a decrease of million or compared to the same period in this change primarily resulted from a decrease in sales to dish network  partially offset by sales to dish mexico and an increase in sales to bell tv 
cost of sales equipment represented and of total equipment sales during the year ended december  and  respectively 
cost of sales services and other 
cost of sales services and other totaled million during the year ended december   a decrease of million or compared to the same period in this change primarily resulted from a decrease in costs associated with fiber backhaul and a decline in other services provided to dish network 
cost of sales services and other represented and of total services and other revenue during the year ended december  and  respectively 
the improvement in this expense to revenue ratio was primarily driven by an increase in transponder leasing and uplink services revenue with relatively low variable costs 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses totaled million during the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to the same period in this increase was related to the development of set top box products for domestic and international cable  direct to home and iptv customers  including the development and integration of slingbox placeshifting technology into existing and future products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million during the year ended december   a decrease of million or compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction of our marketing and advertising expenses for slingboxes and related hardware products and the collection of previously reserved receivables 
selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of total revenue during the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the ratio of the expenses to total revenue was primarily attributable to the decrease in total revenue relative to the decrease in expense  previously discussed 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense totaled million during the year ended december   a million or decrease compared to the same period in the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to less depreciation expense on amc and amc  which we impaired in by a combined amount of million 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense mainly associated with uplink equipment placed in service during impairments of goodwill  indefinite lived and long lived assets

all of the put options are secured by a pledged liquidity source 
our vrdn portfolio is comprised of investments in many municipalities  which are backed by financial institutions or other highly rated companies that serve as the pledged liquidity source

prior to the spin off  our operating cash flows did not necessarily reflect what our operating cash flow would have been as a separate company as our historical operations did not include our satellite services business and our equipment sales were provided to dish network at cost 
cash flows from investing activities

for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of million primarily resulted from net sales of marketable investment securities of million

in certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed 
these amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction  launch or lease of additional satellites 
during november  we entered into a joint venture for a direct to home  or dth  service in mexico known as dish mexico  s 
de rl de rl  or dish mexico 
pursuant to these arrangements  we provide certain broadcast services and satellite capacity and sell hardware such as digital set top boxes and related equipment to dish mexico 
subject to a number of conditions  including regulatory approvals and compliance with various other arrangements  we committed to provide approximately million of value over an initial ten year period  of which million has been satisfied in the form of cash  equipment and services  leaving million remaining under this commitment  included in the table captioned contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements under purchase and other obligations 
of the remaining commitment  approximately million is expected to be paid in cash and the remaining amounts may be satisfied in the form of certain services or equipment 
during the year ended december   we sold million of set top boxes and related accessories to dish mexico that are not related to the original commitment associated with our investment in dish mexico 
during december  we entered into a joint venture  to provide a dth service in taiwan and certain other targeted regions in asia 
we own and have joint control of the entity 
pursuant to these arrangements  we sell hardware such as digital set top boxes and provide certain technical support services 
we have provided million of cash  and an million line of credit that the joint venture may only use to purchase set top boxes from us 
as of december   no amounts have been drawn on the line of credit 
in general  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued satellite related obligations satellites under construction 
as of december   we had entered into the following contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years 
future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under satellite related obligations 
quetzsat during  we entered into a ten year satellite service agreement with ses to lease all of the capacity on quetzsat quetzsat is expected to be launched in and will operate at the degree orbital location 
upon expiration of the initial term  we have the option to renew the transponder service agreement on a year to year basis through the end of life of the quetzsat satellite 
dish network has agreed to lease of the dbs transponders on this satellite from us 
echostar xvi 
during november  we entered into a contract for the construction of echostar xvi  a dbs satellite  which is expected to be completed during and will operate at the degree orbital location 
dish network has agreed to lease all of the capacity on this satellite from us for a portion of its useful life 
purchase obligations our purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for digital set top boxes and related components  digital broadcast operations and transitional service agreements 
our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to  among other things  management s control of inventory levels  and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances  and our future working capital requirements 
satellite insurance we do not carry insurance for any of the in orbit satellites that we own because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure 
the loss of a satellite or other satellite malfunctions or anomalies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance which we may not be able to mitigate by using available capacity on other satellites 
there can be no assurance that we can recover critical transmission capacity in the event one or more of our in orbit satellites were to fail 
in addition  the loss of a satellite or other satellite malfunctions or anomalies could affect our ability to comply with fcc regulatory obligations and our ability to fund the construction or acquisition of replacement satellites for our in orbit fleet in a timely fashion  or at all 
future capital requirements we primarily rely on our existing cash and marketable investment securities balances  as well as cash flow generated through operations to fund our investment needs 
on december   we assigned our rights under one of our launch service contracts to dish network for million 
dish network expects to use this launch service for echostar xv  which is scheduled to launch in late since we currently depend on dish network for a substantial portion of our revenue  our cash flow from operations depend heavily on their needs for equipment and services 
as a result  there can be no assurances that we will always have positive cash flows from operations and should our cash flows turn negative  our existing cash and marketable investment securities balances may be reduced 
our future capital expenditures are likely to increase if we make additional investments in infrastructure necessary to support and expand our satellite services business  or if we decide to purchase one or more additional satellites 
other aspects of our business operations may also require 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued additional capital 
we periodically evaluate various strategic initiatives  the pursuit of which also could require us to raise significant additional capital 
we may also use a significant portion of our existing cash to fund our stock buyback program of up to million of our class a common stock  all of which remained available as of december  however  there can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms or at all 
weak economic conditions have made it more difficult for borrowers to access capital markets on acceptable terms or at all  which may significantly constrain our ability to obtain financing to support our business operations 
this may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position and may  as a result  cause us to defer or abandon profitable business strategies that we would otherwise pursue if financing were available on acceptable terms 
in addition  we have no experience as a separate entity in raising capital and we may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it  on reasonable terms or at all 
the instability in the equity markets has made it difficult for us to raise equity financing without incurring substantial dilution of our existing shareholders  and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that could restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our shareholders or us 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or joint venture agreements on unattractive terms 
in addition  if we are unsuccessful in overturning the district court s ruling on tivo s motion for contempt  we are not successful in developing and deploying potential new alternative technology and we are unable to reach a license agreement with tivo on reasonable terms  we would be required to cease distribution of digital set top boxes with dvr functionality 
in that event  our sales of digital set top boxes to dish network and others would likely significantly decrease and could even potentially cease for a period of time 
furthermore  the inability to offer dvr functionality would place us at a significant disadvantage to our competitors and make it even more difficult for us to penetrate new markets for digital set top boxes 
the adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations if the district court s contempt order is upheld is likely to be significant 
if we are successful in overturning the district court s ruling on tivo s motion for contempt  but unsuccessful in defending against any subsequent claim that our original alternative technology or any potential new alternative technology infringes tivo s patent  we could be prohibited from distributing dvrs 
in that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering dvr functionality and the adverse effect on our business could be material 
because both we and dish network are defendants in the tivo lawsuit  we and dish network are jointly and severally liable to tivo for any final damages and sanctions that may be awarded by the court 
dish network has agreed that it is obligated under the agreements entered into in connection with the spin off to indemnify us for substantially all liability arising from this lawsuit 
we have agreed to contribute an amount equal to our million intellectual property liability limit under the receiver agreement 
we and dish network have further agreed that our million contribution would not exhaust our liability to dish network for other intellectual property claims that may arise under the receiver agreement 
therefore  during the second quarter of  we recorded a charge included in general and administrative expenses dish network on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss of million to reflect this contribution 
we and dish network also agreed that we would each be entitled to joint ownership of  and a cross license to use  any intellectual property developed in connection with any potential new alternative technology 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued because we are jointly and severally liable with dish network  to the extent that dish network does not or is unable to pay any damages or sanctions arising from this lawsuit  we would then be liable for any portion of these damages and sanctions not paid by dish network 
any amounts that dish network may be required to pay could impair its ability to pay us and also negatively impact our future liquidity 
if we become liable for any portion of these damages or sanctions  we may be required to raise additional capital at a time and in circumstances in which we would normally not raise capital 
therefore  any capital we raise may be on terms that are unfavorable to us  which might adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and might also impair our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms in the future to fund our own operations and initiatives 
on february   we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we and a mexican joint venture partner will acquire all of the outstanding share capital of sat lites mexicanos sa de sa  satmex  a mexican satellite operator that operates three satellites and two satellite uplink facilities  delivering video  audio and data services 
under the terms of the agreement  satmex will be acquired in exchange for approximately million in cash  plus up to million in cash on satmex s balance sheet at closing  as a result of which total cash of up to million may be available for satmex s stakeholders 
the transaction is conditioned upon a number of conditions such as  among other things  the successful completion of the offer to purchase satmex s existing senior secured notes  receipt of certain corporate approvals on behalf of the stakeholders of satmex  certain actions with respect to construction of a replacement satellite for satmex and completion of an evaluation of the operational capabilities of satmex s satellites  as well as other closing conditions such as receipt of regulatory approvals

critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
management bases its estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates 
the following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation  judgment and complexity 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities 
we hold debt and equity interests in companies  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices 
we record an investment impairment charge in unrealized and realized gains losses on marketable investment securities and other investments within other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary 
we monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment 
future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
fair value of financial instruments 
fair value estimates of our financial instruments are made at a point in time  based on relevant market data as well as the best information available about the financial instrument 
weak economic conditions have resulted in inactive markets for certain of our financial instruments  including marketable and other investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets 
for certain of these instruments  there is no or limited observable market data 
fair value estimates for financial instruments for which no or limited observable market data is available are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions  liquidity discounts  currency  credit and interest rate risks  loss experience and other factors 
these estimates involve significant uncertainties and judgments and may be a less precise measurement of fair value as compared to financial instruments where observable market data is available 
we make certain assumptions related to expected maturity date  credit and interest rate risk based upon market conditions and prior experience 
as a result  such calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument 
in addition  changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique  including liquidity risks  and estimate of future cash flows  could significantly affect these fair value estimates  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
for example  as of december   we held million of securities that lack observable market quotes and a decrease in our estimated fair value of these securities would result in a decrease of the reported amount by approximately million 
further  our investments accounted for at fair value are speculative 
the changes in the fair value of these investments have historically been volatile 
if the fair value of these investments of million as of december  decreased by  for example  we would have recorded a decrease in the reported amount by million in unrealized losses under unrealized gains losses on investments accounted for at fair value  net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
acquisition of investments in non marketable investment securities 
we calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either as consideration given  or for non cash acquisitions  based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or dcf model 
the dcf methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required 
valuation of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recorded in impairments of goodwill  indefinite lived and long lived assets on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs 
among other reasons  changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually  and also when events and circumstances warrant 
we use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment  if any  of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
while our impairment tests in indicated the fair value of our intangible assets were significantly above their carrying amounts  significant changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period  which would be recorded in impairments of goodwill  indefinite lived and long lived assets on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss and could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
a decrease in the estimated future cash flows or a increase in the discount rate used in estimating the fair value of these assets while all other assumptions remain unchanged would not result in these assets being impaired 
income taxes 
our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence  including trends  and future expectations in each reporting period 
any such valuation allowance is recorded in either income tax provision benefit  net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss or accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity deficit on our consolidated balance sheets 
future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits  or reversals of valuation allowances  as reported in our consolidated results of operations 
uncertainty in tax positions 
management evaluates the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions based on applicable tax law  regulations  case law  administrative rulings and pronouncements and the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position 
changes in our estimates related to the recognition and measurement of the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions could result in significant changes in our income tax provision benefit  which could be material to our consolidated results of operations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued contingent liabilities 
a significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when  or if  an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual 
estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes 
due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event  it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter  a charge could be recorded in a future period to selling  general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
new accounting pronouncements revenue recognition multiple deliverable arrangements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  asu will have on our consolidated financial statements when adopted  as required  on january  seasonality we are affected by seasonality to the extent it impacts our customers 
our customers in the pay tv industry  including dish network  our largest customer  typically experience seasonality 
historically  the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers for the pay tv industry than the second half of the year 
however  we can not provide assurance that this will continue in the future 
inflation inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years 
we believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures or contractual terms 
backlog we do not have any material backlog

the value of this portfolio is negatively impacted by credit losses  however  this risk is mitigated through diversification that limits our exposure to any one issuer 
interest rate risk a change in interest rates would affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities portfolio 
based on our december  current non strategic investment portfolio of million  a hypothetical increase in average interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately million in fair value of this portfolio 
we normally hold these investments to maturity  however  the hypothetical loss in fair value would be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 
our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had an average annual rate of return for the year ended december  of 
a change in interest rates would affect our future annual interest income from this portfolio  since funds would be re invested at different rates as the instruments mature 
a hypothetical decrease in average interest rates during would result in a decrease of approximately million in annual interest income 
strategic marketable investment securities as of december   we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of million 
these investments  which are held for strategic and financial purposes  are concentrated in a small number of companies  are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience volatility 
the fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally  as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in  risks associated with specific industries  and other factors 
these investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses 
in general  the debt instruments held in our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio are not significantly impacted by interest rate fluctuations as their value is more closely related to factors specific to the underlying business 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued restricted cash and marketable investment securities and noncurrent marketable and other investment securities restricted cash and marketable investment securities as of december   we had million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities invested in a cash  b debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies  c commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and d instruments with similar risk  duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper described above 
based on our december  investment portfolio  a hypothetical increase in average interest rates would not have a material impact in the fair value of our restricted cash and marketable investment securities 
other investment securities as of december   we had million of nonpublic debt and equity instruments that we hold for strategic business purposes 
we account for these investments under the cost  equity and fair value methods of accounting 
our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded depends on the success of those companies businesses and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans 
because private markets are not as liquid as public markets  there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments  or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of these nonpublic debt and equity instruments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments 
long term debt as of december   we had million of capital lease obligations  mortgages and other notes payable  of which million represents our capital lease obligations  which are not subject to fair value disclosure requirements 
derivative financial instruments in general  we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes  but we may do so in the future
