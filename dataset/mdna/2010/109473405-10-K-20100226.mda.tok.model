average daily debt was million for the fourth quarter of  which represents a decrease of approximately million from the fourth quarter of interest expense was million for the year ended december   which is a decrease of approximately million from the significant reduction in interest expense was largely due to the decrease in average daily debt outstanding as well as lower overall interest rates

amortization expense amortization expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the increase in amortization expense relates to finite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the cellstar and dangaard telecom transactions in we allocated the purchase price of the dangaard telecom and cellstar acquisitions based on the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the assets acquired in connection with the dangaard telecom transaction included million of finite lived intangible assets assigned to the customer relationships as of july  the acquired finite lived intangible assets have a useful life of approximately fifteen years and are being amortized over the period that the assets are expected to contribute to our future cash flows 
the assets are being amortized on an accelerated method based on the projected cash flows used for valuation purposes 
we believe that these cash flows are most reflective of the pattern in which the economic benefit of the finite lived intangible assets will be consumed 
goodwill impairment charge goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two step test in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year 
during the fourth quarter of  there were severe disruptions in the credit markets and reductions in global economic activity which had significant adverse impacts on stock markets and on the outlook for the wireless industry  both of which contributed to a significant decline in brightpoint s stock price and corresponding market capitalization 
the result of our annual goodwill impairment test was that the carrying amount of the net assets allocated to the emea reporting unit exceeded the fair market value 
the entire amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit was impaired  which resulted in an impairment charge of million 
the impairment charge was approved by our board of directors in february the goodwill allocated to the emea reporting unit is primarily related to the acquisition of dangaard telecom in july the impairment charge resulted from factors impacted by current market conditions including lower market valuation multiples for similar assets  higher discount rates resulting from turmoil in the credit and equity markets  and current cash flow forecasts for the emea markets in which we operate 
the impairment will not result in any current or future cash expenditures

liquidity and capital resources consolidated statement of cash flows we use the indirect method of preparing and presenting our statements of cash flows 
in our opinion  it is more practical than the direct method and provides the reader with a good perspective and analysis of our cash flows 
year ended december  change amounts in s net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities was million in  a decrease of million compared to prior year primarily due to million less cash provided by working capital in compared to the prior year 
cash provided by working capital was million for year ended december  a large customer within our emea division experienced it difficulties at the end of december  resulting in million of anticipated payments being delayed into the first quarter of had this payment been received in  cash provided by working capital in would have been million 
the decrease in cash provided by working capital compared to the prior year was partially offset by million more cash used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities in compared to the prior year 
net cash used for investing activities was million for  an increase of million compared to prior year primarily due to the purchase of our primary north american distribution facility for million plus closing costs and 
table of contents commissions in october excluding the impact of the purchase  net cash used for investing activities for the year ended december  was flat compared to the prior year 
net cash used in financing activities was million  a decrease of million compared to prior year primarily due to million less cash used for repayments of long term debt compared the prior year 
the decrease in cash used for repayments of long term debt is partially offset by million more cash used for repurchases of treasury stock during the year  primarily as part of our share repurchase program 
cash conversion cycle year ended december  days sales outstanding in accounts receivable days inventory on hand days payable outstanding cash conversion cycle days a key source of our liquidity is our ability to invest in inventory  sell the inventory to our customers  collect cash from our customers and pay our suppliers 
we refer to this as the cash conversion cycle 
the cash conversion cycle is measured by the number of days it takes to effect the cycle of investing in inventory  selling the inventory  paying suppliers and collecting cash from customers 
the components in the cash conversion cycle are days sales outstanding in accounts receivable  days inventory on hand  and days payables outstanding 
the cash conversion cycle  as we measure it  is the netting of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable and days inventory on hand with the days of payable outstanding 
circumstances when the cash conversion cycle decreases generally generate cash for the company 
conversely  circumstances when the cash conversion cycle increases generally consume cash in the form of additional investment in working capital 
during  the cash conversion cycle decreased to days from days in days payable outstanding for the year ended december  increased days from the prior year 
the increase in days payable outstanding was primarily due to the timing of payments due to certain vendors compared to the prior year 
the detail calculation of the components of the cash conversion cycle is as follows a days sales outstanding in accounts receivable ending accounts receivable for continuing operations divided by average daily revenue inclusive of value added taxes for foreign operations for the period 
b days inventory on hand ending inventory for continuing operations divided by average daily cost of revenue excluding indirect product and service costs for the period 
c days payables outstanding ending accounts payable for continuing operations divided by average daily cost of revenue excluding indirect product and service costs for the period

borrowings the table below summarizes borrowing capacity that was available to us as of december  in thousands letters of gross credit net availability outstanding guarantees availability global term loans global credit facility other total 
table of contents liquidity analysis we measure liquidity as the total of unrestricted cash and unused borrowing availability  and we use this measurement as an indicator of how much access to cash we have to either grow the business through investment in new markets  acquisitions  or through expansion of existing service or product lines or to contend with adversity such as unforeseen operating losses potentially caused by reduced demand for our products and services  material uncollectible accounts receivable  or material inventory write downs  as examples 
the table below shows our liquidity calculation 
december  change amounts in s unrestricted cash unused borrowing availability liquidity at december  we were in compliance with the covenants in each of our credit agreements 
our global credit facility contains two financial covenants that are sensitive to significant fluctuations in earnings a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
the leverage ratio is calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter  and is calculated as total debt including guarantees and letters of credit divided by trailing twelve month bank adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization bank adjusted ebitda 
the interest coverage ratio is also calculated as of the end of each fiscal quarter  and is calculated as trailing twelve month bank adjusted ebitda divided by trailing twelve month net cash interest expense 
global credit facility company ratio at ratio covenant december  maximum leverage ratio not to exceed minimum interest coverage ratio not below we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants for the next months 
capital expenditures were million  million and million for  and capital expenditures for include the purchase of our primary north american distribution facility for million plus closing costs and commissions in october the remaining capital expenditures for and for and were primarily related to investments in our information technology infrastructure and software upgrades as well as equipment and leasehold improvements for new facilities 
expenditures for capital resources historically have been composed of information systems  leasehold improvements and warehouse equipment 
we expect this pattern to continue in future periods 
we expect our level of capital expenditures to be affected by our geographic expansion activity  the anticipated implementation of a new transportation and warehouse management system throughout europe and the implementation of our centers of excellence and related consolidation of existing facilities in emea 
we believe that existing capital resources and cash flows provided by future operations will enable us to maintain our current level of operations and our planned operations including capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
we believe that our existing balances  our anticipated cash flows from operations and our unused borrowing availability will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements we have an agreement with an unrelated third party for the factoring of specific accounts receivable in spain in order to reduce the amount of working capital required to fund such receivables 
our credit agreement permits the factoring of up to million of receivables in our operations outside of the us the factoring of accounts receivable under this agreement is accounted for as a sale in accordance with asc  transfers and servicing  and accordingly  is accounted for as an off balance sheet arrangement 
proceeds on the transfer reflect the face value of the account less a discount 
the discount is recorded as a charge in interest  net in the consolidated statement of operations in the period of the sale 

table of contents net funds received reduced accounts receivable outstanding while increasing cash 
we are the collection agent on behalf of the third parties for these arrangements and have no significant retained interests or servicing liabilities related to the accounts receivable that we have sold 
at december   we had sold million of accounts receivable under this factoring arrangement in spain  which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date 
fees paid under these programs were million for the year ended december  as previously disclosed in our quarterly report on form q for the quarterly period ended june   the factoring agreement for our germany operation terminated in july at december  we had sold million of accounts receivable under this agreement 
we successfully renegotiated shorter payment terms with the customer for which the accounts receivable were previously factored under this agreement 
contractual obligations and commitments our disclosures regarding cash requirements of contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings 
information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period less than to to total year years years thereafter amounts in s operating leases total borrowings interest on third party debt and lines of credit purchase obligations pension obligation letters of credit total interest on third party debt is calculated based on the interest rate as of december  and repayments of outstanding debt in accordance with our credit agreement 
interest does not include the effects of any prepayments of borrowings permitted under the credit agreement 
prepayments could significantly decrease interest obligations in future years 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fin  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex 
consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period as new information becomes available  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee and the audit committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical based on the criteria above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements in any one period 
deferred taxes and effective tax rates we estimate the effective tax rates and associated liabilities or assets for each legal entity in accordance with asc we use tax planning to minimize or defer tax liabilities to future periods 
in recording effective tax rates and related liabilities and assets  we rely upon estimates  which are based upon our interpretation of united states and local tax laws as they apply to our legal entities and our overall tax structure 
audits by local tax jurisdictions  including the united states government  could yield different interpretations from our own and cause the company to owe more or less taxes than originally recorded 
we utilize internal and external skilled resources in the various tax jurisdictions to evaluate our position and to assist in our calculation of tax expense and related liabilities 
for interim periods  we accrue our tax provision at the effective tax rate that we expect for the full year 
as the actual results from our various businesses vary from our estimates earlier in the year  we adjust the succeeding interim period s effective tax rates to reflect our best estimate for the year to date results and for the full year 
as part of the effective tax rate  if we determine that a deferred tax asset arising from temporary differences is not likely to be utilized  we will establish a valuation allowance against that asset to record it at the expected realizable value 
at december   total deferred tax assets were million  net of million of valuation allowances 
goodwill and long lived asset impairment we assess goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
we perform our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter 
in our impairment analysis we estimate the fair value of an enterprise based on the present value of anticipated future cash flows 
based on the impairment analysis for the americas and asia pacific reporting units in the fourth quarter of  we determined that there was no impairment of the goodwill allocated to those reporting units 
a change in the anticipated future cash flows for either reporting unit would not have resulted in any impairment 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  we test our long lived assets for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
for long lived assets recoverability testing  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset 
in the third quarter of  we lost a significant product distribution business within our latin america operation 
as a result  we evaluated the long lived assets of the latin america operations for recoverability 
we determined that the finite lived intangible asset acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of certain assets of cellstar was impaired 
accordingly  we recognized a million impairment charge  which represented the carrying value of the asset 
the impairment will not result in any current or future cash expenditures 
we continue to evaluate lower profitability programs that do not currently meet our requirements for returns on invested capital 
exiting these programs might result in future impairment charges for the related long lived assets

forward looking and cautionary statements certain information in this form k may contain forward looking statements regarding future events or the future performance of the company 
these risk factors include  without limitation  uncertainties relating to customer plans and commitments  including  without limitation  i the loss or reduction in orders from principal customers or a reduction in the prices we are able to charge these customers could cause our revenues to decline and impair our cash flows  ii we buy a significant amount of our products from a limited number of suppliers  and they may not provide us with competitive products at reasonable prices when we need them in the future  iii our business could be harmed by consolidation of mobile operators  iv the current economic downturn could cause a severe disruption in our operations  v fluctuations in regional demand patterns and economic factors could harm our operations  vi our debt facilities could prevent us from borrowing additional funds  if needed  vii collections of our accounts receivable  viii our reliance on suppliers to provide trade credit facilities to adequately fund our on going operations and product purchases  ix a significant percentage of our revenues are generated outside of the united states in countries that may have volatile currencies or other risks  x the impact that seasonality may have on our business and results  xi we make significant investments in the technology used in our business and rely on that technology to function effectively without interruptions  xii our future operating results will depend on our ability to maintain volumes and margins  xiii our ability to expand and implement our future growth strategy  including acquisitions  xiv uncertainty regarding whether wireless equipment manufacturers and wireless network operators will continue to outsource aspects of their business to us  xv our reliance upon third parties to manufacture products which we distribute and reliance upon their quality control procedures  our ability to retain existing logistic services customers at acceptable returns upon expiration of existing agreements  xvi rapid technological changes in the wireless industry could render our services or the products we handle obsolete or less marketable  xvii effect of natural disasters  epidemics  hostilities or terrorist attacks on our operations  xviii intense industry competition  xix our ability to manage and sustain future growth at our historical or current rates  xx our ability to continue to enter into relationships and financing that may provide us with minimal returns or losses on our investments  xxi our implementation of european centers of excellence may not be successful  xxii our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel  the cost of complying with labor agreements and high rate of personnel turnover  xxiii protecting our proprietary information  xxiv our dependence on our computer and communications systems  xxvi uncertainty regarding future volatility in our common stock price  xxvii potential dilution to existing shareholders from the issuance of securities under our long term incentive plans xxviii the existence of anti takeover measures 
because of the aforementioned uncertainties affecting our future operating results  past performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  estimate intend  likely  will  should and plan and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue 
table of contents reliance on any of these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date that such statement was made 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk concentration of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of cash investments  forward currency contracts and accounts receivable 
we maintain cash investments primarily in aaa rated money market mutual funds and overnight repurchase agreements  which have minimal credit risk 
we use high credit quality financial institutions when purchasing forward currency contracts in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable 
in many circumstances  we have obtained credit insurance to mitigate our credit risk 
exchange rate risk management a substantial portion of our revenue and expenses are transacted in markets worldwide and may be denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in specific countries political  economic or regulatory conditions and trade protection measures 
our foreign currency risk management program is designed to reduce  but not eliminate  unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates by hedging 
generally  through the purchase of forward contracts  we hedge transactional currency risk  but do not hedge foreign currency revenue or future operating income 
also  we do not hedge our investment in foreign subsidiaries  where fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our comprehensive income or loss 
an adverse change defined as a strengthening of the us dollar in all exchange rates  relative to our foreign currency risk management program  would not have had a material impact on our results of operations for or at december   we had no cash flow or net investment hedges open 
our sensitivity analysis of foreign currency exchange rate movements does not factor in a potential change in volumes or local currency prices of our products sold or services provided 
actual results may differ materially from those discussed above 
interest rate risk management we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
investments with interest rate risk include short term marketable securities 
debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed and variable rate debt 
to mitigate interest rate risks  we utilize interest rate swaps to convert certain portions of our variable rate debt to fixed interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our borrowing arrangements 
our risk management program seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility may have on interest expense 
we use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure 
at december   swaps with a total notional amount of million were outstanding 
these swaps have maturity dates ranging from these derivative instruments are designated as hedges under asc  derivatives hedging 
changes in market value  when effective  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet 
amounts are recorded to interest expense as settled 
a increase in short term borrowing rates during the quarter would have resulted in only a nominal increase in interest expense 
the fair value liability associated with those swaps was million at december
