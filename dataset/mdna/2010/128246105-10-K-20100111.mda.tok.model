item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  those presented under risks related to our business included in item a and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leader in the distribution of avocados  prepared avocado products  and other perishable food products throughout the united states 
our history and expertise in handling california grown avocados has allowed us to develop a reputation of delivering quality products  at competitive prices  while providing competitive returns to our growers 
this reputation has enabled us to expand our product offerings to include avocados sourced on an international basis  prepared avocado products  and other perishable foods 
we report our operations in two different business segments fresh products and processed products 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we report our financial results on a november to october fiscal year basis to coincide with the california avocado harvest season 
our fresh products business grades  sizes  packs  cools  and ripens if desired avocados for delivery to our customers 
we presently operate three packinghouses in southern california 
these packinghouses handled approximately of the california avocado crop during the fiscal year  based on data obtained from the california avocado commission 
our operating results and the returns we pay our growers are highly dependent on the volume of avocados delivered to our packinghouses  as a significant portion of our costs are fixed 
our strategy calls for continued efforts to retain and recruit growers that meet our business model 
additionally  our fresh products business also procures avocados grown in chile  mexico and peru  as well as other various commodities  including tomatoes  papayas  mushrooms  and pineapples 
we operate a packinghouse in mexico that  together with certain co packers that we frequently purchase fruit from  handled approximately of the mexican avocado crop bound for the united states market and approximately of the avocados exported from mexico to countries other than the united states during the mexican season  based on our estimates 
additionally  during the chilean avocado season  we handled approximately of the chilean avocado crop  based on our estimates 
our strategy is to increase our market share of currently sourced avocados to all accepted marketplaces 
we believe our diversified avocado sources provides a level of supply stability that may  over time  help solidify the demand for avocados among consumers in the united states and elsewhere in the world 
we believe our efforts in distributing our other various commodities  such as those shown above  complement our offerings of avocados 
from time to time  we continue to explore distribution of other crops that provide reasonable returns to the business 
our processed products business procures avocados  processes avocados into a wide variety of guacamole products  and distributes the processed product to our customers 
customers include both food service industry and retail businesses and our products primarily include both frozen and cold pasteurized fresh guacamole 
cold pasteurized fresh guacamole refers to fresh guacamole products that has been treated by one of our ultra high pressure machines 
these machines utilize ultra high pressure only ie without additives or preservatives and destroy the cells of any bacteria that could lead to spoilage or oxidation issues 
due to the long shelf life of our frozen processed products and the purity of our ultra high pressure guacamole  we believe that we are well positioned to address the diverse taste and needs of today s customers 
we believe our ultra high pressure machines will enable our company to deliver the widest available array of prepared avocado products to our customers 
we also believe that we are positioned to expand our ultra high pressure product line to include more avocado related products  high end salsas  mangoes and other readily available fruit products 
we continue to seek to expand our relationships with major food service companies and develop alliances that will allow our products to reach a larger percentage of the marketplace 
net sales of frozen products represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and net sales of our ultra high pressure products represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and our fresh products business is characterized by crop volume and price changes 
furthermore  the operating results of all of our businesses  including our processed products business  have been  and will continue to be  affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors  such as pests and disease  weather patterns  changes in demand by consumers  the timing of the receipt  reduction  or cancellation of significant customer orders  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of our products  our ability to develop  introduce  and market new products on a timely basis  availability and cost of avocados and supplies from growers and vendors  new product introductions by our competitors  change in the mix of avocados and processed products we sell  and general economic conditions 
we believe  however  that we are currently positioned to address these risks and deliver favorable operating results for the foreseeable future 

table of contents recent developments dividend payment on december   we paid a per share dividend in the aggregate amount of  to shareholders of record on december  contingencies hacienda suit we are currently under examination by the mexican tax authorities hacienda for the tax years ended december  and december  we have received assessments totaling approximately million and million from hacienda related to the amount of income at our mexican subsidiary 
subsequent to that initial assessment  the hacienda offered a settlement of approximately  related to the tax year assessment  which we declined 
in the second quarter of  we won our most recent appeal case for the tax year ended december  the hacienda subsequently appealed that decision and the case was sent back to the tax court due to administrative error by such jurisdiction 
in the second quarter of  the hacienda initiated an examination related to tax year ended december  as well 
we are not aware of any assessments related to this examination  but we do not expect this examination to have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we pledged our processed products building located in uruapan  michoacan  mexico as collateral to the hacienda in regards to these assessments 
irs examination the internal revenue service has concluded their examination for the year ended october  no changes were noted 
from time to time  we are also involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business that we do not believe will have a material adverse impact on our financial statements 
term revolving credit agreement in july  we renewed and extended our non collateralized  revolving credit facility with bank of america  na under the terms of this agreement  we are advanced funds for both working capital and long term productive asset purchases 
total credit available under the borrowing agreement is now million  up from million and now expires on july  this increase was at our request and not due to any immediate cash flows needs 
the credit facility contains various financial covenants  the most significant relating to tangible net worth as defined  and funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio as defined 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at october  first earn out payment in may  we purchased all of the outstanding shares of hawaiian sweet hs and all ownership interests of hawaiian pride hp from the chairman of our board of directors  chief executive office and president 
hs and hp engage in tropical product packing and processing operations in hawaii 
the acquisition agreement provides  among other things  that as a result of the acquisition agreement  calavo shall make an initial purchase price payment in the aggregate amount of  for both entities 
calavo made the initial payment on may  calavo shall also make two additional annual payments  ranging from  to  based on certain operating results the earn out payment s  as defined 
on september   we remitted the first annual earn out payment  totaling approximately million 
this represents the minimum payment of million  less million of working capital shortfall 
as a result of this payment  we recorded an adjustment decreasing property  plant and equipment by million  other assets by million  and accrued expenses by million 
such adjustment relates to the resolution of the first deferred and contingent payment 
we anticipate recording one more adjustment once the second deferred and contingent payment is determined in fiscal critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate all of our estimates  including those related to the areas of customer and grower receivables  inventories  useful lives of property  plant and equipment  promotional allowances  income taxes  retirement benefits  and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods 

table of contents management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting estimates in this annual report 
we believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
promotional allowances 
we provide for promotional allowances at the time of sale  based on our historical experience 
our estimates are generally based on evaluating the relationship between promotional allowances and gross sales 
the derived percentage is then applied to the current period s sales revenues in order to arrive at the appropriate debit to sales allowances for the period 
the offsetting credit is made to accrued liabilities 
when certain amounts of specific customer accounts are subsequently identified as promotional  they are written off against this allowance 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates and such differences are recognized as an adjustment to net sales in the period they are identified 
a change in the derived percentage for the entire year would impact results of operations by approximately million 
income taxes 
we account for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  we perform an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  the liability will be reversed and we will recognize a tax benefit during the period in which it is determined the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which it is determined that a recorded tax liability is less than the ultimate assessment is expected to be 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from management s estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
goodwill  defined as unidentified asset s acquired in conjunction with a business acquisition  is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test would be unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
goodwill impairment testing requires significant judgment and management estimates  including  but not limited to  the determination of i the number of reporting units  ii the goodwill and other assets and liabilities to be allocated to the reporting units and iii the fair values of the reporting units 
the estimates and assumptions described above  along with other factors such as discount rates  will significantly affect the outcome of the impairment tests and the amounts of any resulting impairment losses 
we performed our annual assessment of goodwill and determined that no impairment existed as of october  allowance for accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable balances based on historical experience and the aging of the related accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income  expressed as percentages of our total net sales  for the periods indicated year ended october  net sales gross margins selling  general and administrative operating income interest income interest expense other income  net net income net sales we believe that the fundamentals for our products continue to be favorable 
firstly  americans are eating more avocados 
over the last years  united states us consumption of avocados has expanded at a compound annual growth rate and we do not anticipate this growth significantly changing 
we believe that the healthy eating trend that has been developing in the united states contributes to such growth  as avocados  which are cholesterol and sodium free  are dense in fiber  vitamin b  antioxidants  potassium  folate  and contain unsaturated fat  which help lower cholesterol 
also  a growing number of research studies seem to suggest that phytonutrients  which avocados are rich in  help fight chronic illnesses  such as heart disease and cancer 
additionally  we believe that the demographic changes in the us will greatly impact the consumption of avocados and avocado based products 
the hispanic community currently accounts for approximately of the us population  and the total number of hispanics is estimated to triple by the year avocados are considered a staple item purchased by hispanic consumers  as the per capita avocado consumption in mexico is estimated to be more than seven fold that of the us we anticipate avocado products will further penetrate the united states marketplace driven by year round availability of fresh avocados due to imports  a rapid growing hispanic population  and the promotion of the health benefits of avocados 
as the largest marketer of avocado products in the united states  we believe that we are well positioned to leverage this trend and to grow all segments of our business 
additionally  we also believe that avocados and avocado based products will further penetrate other marketplaces that we currently operate in  as interest in avocados continues to expand 
in october  the usda announced the creation of a hass avocado board to promote the sale of hass variety avocados in the us marketplace 
this board provides a basis for a unified funding of promotional activities based on an assessment on all avocados sold in the us marketplace 
the california avocado commission  which receives its funding from california avocado growers  has historically shouldered the promotional and advertising costs supporting avocado sales 
we believe that the incremental funding of promotional and advertising programs in the us will  in the long term  positively impact average selling prices and will favorably impact our avocado businesses 
during fiscal  and  on behalf of avocado growers  we remitted approximately million  million and million to the california avocado commission 
during fiscal  and  we remitted approximately million  million and million to the hass avocado board related to avocados 
sales of products and related costs of products sold are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
service revenue  including freight  ripening  storage  bagging and palletization charges  is recorded when services are performed and sales of the related products are delivered 
we provide for sales returns and promotional allowances at the time of shipment  based on our experience 
the following table summarizes our net sales by business segment change change dollars in thousands net sales fresh products processed products total net sales as a percentage of net sales fresh products processed products 
table of contents net sales for the year ended october   when compared to  decreased by approximately million  or  principally as a result of a decrease in both our fresh products and processed products segments 
the decrease in fresh product sales for the year ended october  was primarily related to decreased sales of california avocados  tomatoes  and pineapples 
these decreases were partially offset  however  by increased sales from mexican and chilean sourced avocados 
while the procurement of fresh avocados related to our fresh products segment is seasonal based on region  our processed products business is generally not subject to a seasonal effect 
the decrease in net sales delivered by our processed products business was due primarily to a decrease in pounds sold 
the following tables set forth sales by product category and sales incentives  by segment dollars in thousands year ended october  year ended october  fresh processed fresh processed products products total products products total third party sales avocados tomatoes pineapples papayas other fresh products processed food service processed retail and club total gross sales less sales incentives net sales year ended october  year ended october  fresh processed fresh processed products products total products products total third party sales avocados tomatoes pineapples papayas other fresh products processed food service processed retail and club total gross sales less sales incentives net sales net sales to third parties by segment exclude value added services billed by our uruapan packinghouse  uruapan processing plant and mexicali processing plant to the parent company

for fiscal years   and  inter segment sales and cost of sales for processed products totaling million million  and million were eliminated 
fresh products fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales delivered by the business decreased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to this decrease was primarily related to decreased sales of california avocados  tomatoes  and pineapples 
such decreases were partially offset  however  by increased sales from mexican and chilean sourced avocados 
for fiscal  due to the significant increase in the mexican avocado crop  there was an increase in the volume of avocados delivered to the united states market 
as a result  avocado prices industry wide decreased for most of fiscal  which primarily caused our total avocado revenues to decrease for the year 
for fiscal year  california sourced avocado sales reflect a decrease in pounds of avocados sold  when compared to the same prior year period 
this decrease in pounds sold is primarily related to the corresponding decrease in the california avocado crop for fiscal such decrease is believed to be primarily related to poor weather conditions 
our market share of california avocados increased to for fiscal year  when compared to a market share for the same prior year period 
the average selling price  on a per carton basis  of california avocados sold increased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this increase to the lower overall volume of california avocados in the marketplace 
california avocados are primarily sold in the us marketplace 
we anticipate that sales of california grown avocados will significantly increase in fiscal  due to a significantly larger expected avocado crop 
sales of tomatoes decreased million  or  for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in sales for tomatoes is primarily due to the decrease in the average carton selling price by 
this was partially offset 
table of contents by an increase in the volume of tomatoes by approximately million cartons  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute most of this decrease in the per carton selling price to the out of season production from the us east coast that increased the volume of tomatoes in the us marketplace at the very beginning of the mexican tomato season 
sales of pineapples decreased million  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in sales for pineapples is primarily due to the decrease in the per unit selling price by  in addition to the decrease in the volume of pineapples by approximately million units  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this decrease in the per carton selling price to the volume of pineapples in the us marketplace and the recession in the united states 
our agreement with maui pineapple company ended december   and is not expected to be extended 
we are actively pursuing other sources of pineapples  but the volume of pineapples is expected to decrease next year 
partially offsetting such decreases was an increase in sales of mexican sourced avocados  which increased million  or  for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the increase in mexican sourced avocados was primarily related to an increase in the volume of mexican fruit sold of million pounds  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this increase to the large mexican avocado crop for fiscal such increase was partially offset  however  by a decrease in the average carton selling price of mexican avocados  which decreased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this decrease to the higher overall volume of mexican avocados in the marketplace 
sales of chilean sourced avocados increased million  or for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the volume of chilean fruit sold increased by approximately million pounds  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
this increase was primarily related to the improvement of the chilean avocado crop in fiscal year when compared to the disappointing crop in fiscal year in addition to the increase in pounds sold  our average selling prices  on a per carton basis  experienced an increase of for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
we attribute some of these price fluctuations to the smaller california avocado crops  as well as the timing of the delivery of such crops  in the marketplace during fiscal mexican and chilean grown avocados are primarily sold in the us  japanese  and or european marketplace 
we anticipate that the combined sales of mexican and chilean grown avocados will increase marginally in fiscal fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales delivered by the business increased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to this increase was primarily related to an increase in sales related to mexico and california sourced avocados  tomatoes  and pineapples 
such increases were partially offset  however  by a decrease in chilean avocado sales 
sales of mexican sourced avocados increased million  or  for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in the average per carton selling price of mexican avocados 
the average per carton selling price of mexican avocados increased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this increase to the small california avocado crop in the marketplace during fiscal  as well as the premium pricing related to our proripevip tm avocado ripening program 
the volume of mexican fruit sold decreased by approximately million pounds  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
sales of pineapples and tomatoes increased million and million from fiscal to the volume of pineapples and tomatoes increased by approximately million cartons  or and million cartons  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
these increases were primarily related to our agreements with agricola belher of mexico for the tomatoes and our consignment and marketing agreement with maui pineapple company  ltd for the pineapples 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these agreements 
additionally  the average selling price  on a per carton basis  of tomatoes increased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this increase to the quality of our tomatoes in the us marketplace 
sales of chilean sourced avocados decreased million for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the volume of chilean fruit sold decreased by approximately million pounds  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
this decrease was primarily related to the smaller size of the chilean avocado crop 
such decreased volume was partially offset  however  by an increase in our average selling prices  on a per carton basis  which experienced an increase of for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
we attribute some of these price fluctuations to the smaller chilean and california avocado crops  as well as the delivery of such crops  in the marketplace during fiscal 
table of contents sales of california sourced avocados increased million for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
this increase was primarily related to an increase in our average selling prices of 
the pounds sold of california sourced avocados remained consistent with the same prior year period 
our market share of shipped california avocados decreased to for fiscal  when compared to a market share for the same prior year period 
for fiscal year  average selling prices  on a per carton basis  for california avocados were higher when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this increase to the small california avocado crop for the season 
processed products fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales decreased by approximately million  or for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
this decrease is primarily related to a decrease in total pounds sold for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
frozen product sales are closely linked to the economic environment of the foodservice industry 
due to the economic decline in  we experienced a decrease in sales for our frozen products  as fewer consumers went out to eat at restaurants 
partially offsetting this decline  however  the average net selling price per pound increased from the corresponding prior year period 
this increase is primarily related to a change in sales mix 
we currently have two l ultra high pressure machines located in uruapan and estimate we are operating at approximately of the combined machines capacities as of october  we believe this combined capacity is reasonable given our current sales projections and expected growth 
net sales of our ultra high pressure products represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and we believe that these ultra high pressure machines will enable our company to deliver the widest available array of prepared avocado and other products to our customers 
consequently  we believe that we are positioned to expand our ultra high pressure product line to include more avocado related products  high end salsas  mangoes and other readily available fruit products 
we anticipate a marginal increase in sales related to our processed products 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales increased by approximately million  or for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
the increase in net sales is primarily attributable to an increase in the net selling price totaling per product pound sold  or  partially offset by a decrease of million pounds of product sold  or 
the increase in our net average selling price primarily relates to a change in our product mix 
during fiscal year  the decrease in pounds sold primarily relates to a decrease in the sale of both our frozen and high pressure guacamole products  which decreased approximately and when compared to the same prior year period 
gross margins the following table summarizes our gross margins and gross profit percentages by business segment change change dollars in thousands gross margins fresh products processed products total gross margins gross profit percentages fresh products processed products consolidated our cost of sales consists predominantly of fruit costs  packing materials  freight and handling  labor and overhead including depreciation associated with preparing food products  and other direct expenses pertaining to products sold 
consolidated gross margin  as a percent of sales  increased for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year gross margins increased by approximately million  or  for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
these increases were attributable to improvements in both our fresh products and our processed products segment 

table of contents fresh products fiscal vs 
fiscal during fiscal year  as compared to the same prior year period  the increase in our fresh products segment gross margin percentage was primarily related to a significant decrease in fruit costs for mexican sourced avocados  as well as a decrease in substantially all operating costs related to our mexican operations 
these decreases are primarily related to the large mexican avocado crop  as well as the considerable strengthening of the us dollar compared to the mexican peso 
for fiscal year  when compared to the prior year period  we experienced an increase in the volume of mexican sourced avocados sold by million pounds or 
combined  these had the effect of decreasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  positively impacted gross margins 
such increase was partially offset  however  by a decrease in the average carton selling price of mexican avocados  which decreased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
collectively  these items positively increased gross margins generated from the sale of mexican avocados from approximately million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year as mentioned above  the considerable strengthening of the us dollar compared to the mexican peso positively affected our gross margin for fiscal year in this era of economic uncertainty  it is unknown whether this favorable exchange rate will continue into fiscal year any significant fluctuations in the strength of the us dollar compared to the mexican peso may have a material impact on future gross margins for our fresh and processed products segments 
the gross margin and gross profit percentage for consignment sales  including chilean avocados  pineapples  and tomatoes  are dependent on the volume of fruit we handle  the average selling prices  and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to third party growers packers 
the gross margin we earn is generally based on a commission agreed to with each party  which varies from a fixed rate per box to a percent of the overall selling price 
although we generally do not take legal title to such avocados and perishable products  we do assume responsibilities principally assuming credit risk  inventory loss and delivery risk  and limited pricing risk that are consistent with acting as a principal in the transaction 
accordingly  our results of operations include sales and cost of sales from the sale of avocados and perishable products procured under consignment arrangements 
for fiscal years  we generated gross margins of million from the sale of fresh produce products that were packed by third parties 
gross margin percentages related to california avocados are largely dependent on production yields achieved at our packinghouses  current market prices of avocados  our packing and marketing fee  and the volume of avocados packed 
a significant portion of our costs are fixed 
as such  a lower volume of fruit going through our packinghouses will decrease our gross margin percentage 
pounds of california avocados sold decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal this had the effect of increasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  negatively impacted gross margins 
fiscal vs 
fiscal during fiscal year  our gross margins generated from the sale of mexican avocados decreased from approximately million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year such decrease was primarily related to a decrease in the volume of mexican avocados sold  as well as higher fruit costs

as mentioned above  the gross margin and gross profit percentage for consignment sales  including chilean avocados  pineapples  and tomatoes  are dependent on the volume of fruit we handle  the average selling prices  and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to third party growers packers 
for fiscal years and  we generated gross margins of million  and million from the sale of fresh produce products that were packed by third parties 
for california sourced avocados  our gross margin percentage increased during fiscal year when compared to the same prior year period 
such increase is primarily related to a increase in pounds of avocados sold  an increase in our packing and marketing fee  and a increase in the average sales price of california avocados 
combined  these had the effect of decreasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  positively impacted gross margins 
processed products fiscal vs 
fiscal gross margin percentages for our processed products business are largely dependent on the pricing of our final product and the cost of avocados used in preparing guacamole 
the processed products gross profit percentages for the fiscal year  when 
table of contents compared to the same prior year period  increased million or  primarily as a result of lower fruit and operating costs  partially offset by a decrease in total pounds sold by 
as discussed above  the large mexican avocado crop  as well as the considerable strengthening of the us dollar compared to the mexican peso  significantly decreased our per pound costs 
we anticipate that the gross profit percentage for our processed product segment will continue to experience fluctuations during the next fiscal year primarily due to the uncertainty of the cost of fruit that will used in the production process  and the uncertainty of the exchange rate between the us dollar and the mexican peso as discussed above 
fiscal vs 
fiscal during fiscal year  the processed products gross profit percentages marginally decreased primarily as a result of high fruit costs  as well as increased packaging costs  both of which had the effect of increasing our per pound costs 
in addition  there was a marginal decrease in total pounds produced  which had the effect of increasing our per pound costs 
these increases were partially offset  however  by a decrease in the production and sale of less profitable items

for fiscal year  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or when compared to the same period for fiscal this increase was primarily related to higher corporate costs  including  but not limited to  costs related to an increase in management bonuses totaling approximately million  an increase in salaries and benefits totaling approximately million  and an increase in general insurance totaling approximately million 
such higher corporate costs were partially offset  however  by lower broker commissions totaling approximately million and lower audit fees totaling approximately million

such higher corporate costs were partially offset  however  by a decrease in bad debt expense totaling approximately million 
interest income change change dollars in thousands interest income percentage of net sales interest income was primarily generated from loans to growers 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal as compared to is due to the poor california avocado crop  and the resulting decreases in the balances due to us from these growers

during fiscal year  interest income includes interest accrued on notes receivable from directors and officers of approximately million 
such notes were paid in fiscal year interest expense change change dollars in thousands interest expense percentage of net sales interest expense is primarily generated from our line of credit borrowings  as well as our term loan agreement with farm credit west  pca

our effective income tax rate increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year primarily as a result of an increase in foreign taxes  partially offset by a decrease in our average state tax rate 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents our operating results for each of the eight fiscal quarters in the period ended october  the information for each of these quarters is derived from our unaudited interim financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
in our opinion  all necessary adjustments  which consist only of normal and recurring accruals  have been included to fairly present our unaudited quarterly results 
historically  we receive and sell a substantially lesser number of california avocados in our first fiscal quarter

asc sfas no 
provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
fasb asc sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
fasb asc sfas no 
also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs  where available 
the following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by the standard that we use to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities

asu amends accounting standards codification topic  fair value measurements 
specifically  asu provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the following methods a valuation technique that uses a the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or b quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets and or a valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of topic of the accounting standards codification 
asu also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to adjust to include inputs relating to the existence of transfer restrictions on that liability
