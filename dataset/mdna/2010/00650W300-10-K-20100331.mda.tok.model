item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a springfield  ohio based developer  owner and manager of retirement communities  assisted living facilities  nursing homes  and provide home health care services in the state of ohio 
we currently manage fourteen facilities  comprised of six skilled nursing centers  six assisted living residences and two independent living senior housing facilities  totaling approximately beds 
we have an ownership interest in eight of the facilities we manage  comprised of ownership of two skilled nursing facilities and two assisted living facilities  ownership in one independent living facility as well as a ownership in three assisted living facilities 
we lease one additional skilled nursing facility 
the assisted living facilities that we own operate under the name hearth home  with the tag line home is where the hearth is we also maintain a development consulting initiative which is strategic in providing potential management opportunities to our core long term care business 
adcare health systems  inc and hearth home are registered trademarks 
all of our properties are located within the state of ohio 
we believe that the assisted living industry is the preferred residential alternative for seniors who cannot live independently due to physical or cognitive frailties but who do not require the more intensive medical attention provided by a skilled nursing facility 
generally  assisted living provides housing and hour personal support services designed to assist seniors with activities of daily living such as bathing and dressing 
our unique approach to assisted living presents individuals with choices  passively encouraging socialization and advancing each resident with dignity and hospitality 
our facilities are designed to passively encourage socialization by providing smaller bedrooms compared to our competition while providing larger common areas 
this encourages our residents to spend less time alone in their rooms and more time with family and other residents in the common areas 
on the continuum of social to medical model  we remain as close to the social end of the spectrum as possible 
we believe that assisted living services will continue to increase as an attractive alternative to nursing home care because a variety of supportive services and supervision can be obtained in a more independent and less institutional setting 
generally  basic care and support services can be offered more economically in an assisted living facility than in a skilled nursing facility 
assisted living facility services are most commonly paid for from patients private funds 
there is also limited coverage by medicaid and some long term care insurances 
our skilled nursing facilities provide skilled nursing health care services  including room and board  nutrition services  recreational therapy  social services  housekeeping and laundry services 
skilled nursing facilities dispense medications prescribed by the patients physicians 
we also provide for the delivery of ancillary medical services 
these specialty services include rehabilitation therapy services such as audiology  speech  occupational and physical therapies  which are provided through licensed therapists and registered nurses and the provision of medical supplies  nutritional support  infusion therapies and related clinical services 
skilled nursing facility services are most commonly paid for by medicare  medicaid  and various commercial insurances or from patients private funds 
in recent years  we observed the trend that more seniors were staying in their homes for a longer period of time prior to moving into a long term care setting 
we have also observed that more seniors are using nursing and assisted living facilities for short rehabilitation stays and then moving back to their homes 
we have taken advantage of this opportunity and expanded our operations to provide personal care and health care services in the home 
accordingly  in january   we acquired assured health care  a home health care service provider located in dayton  ohio 
assured has been providing home health care services in the greater dayton area since home health care services include four broad categories home health nursing services  infusion therapy intravenous delivery and administration of nutrients  fluids  antibiotics and other medications to patients  respiratory therapy  and home medical equipment 
these services are all provided within the patient s home 
these services are paid for by medicare and various state medicaid programs as well as commercial insurance carriers 

table of contents segments our business operates in two segments management and facility based care and home based care 
in our management and facility based care segment  we derive revenues from three primary sources 
we operate and have ownership interests in eight facilities for which we collect fees from the residents of those facilities 
profits losses are generated to the extent that the monthly patient fees exceed the costs associated with operating those facilities 
we also manage assisted living facilities and nursing homes owned by third parties 
with respect to these facilities  we receive a management fee based on the revenue generated by the facilities 
within our management facility based care segment  we provide development  consulting and accounting services to third parties 
in these instances  we receive a fee for providing those services 
these fees vary from project to project  with the development fee in most cases being based on a percentage of the total cost to develop the project 
management and facility based care segment we focus on two primary indicators in evaluating the financial performance of our business 
those indicators are facility occupancy and staffing 
facility staffing is important because payroll and related payroll costs represent approximately of our total operating costs 
staffing levels and the quality of staff are closely monitored by management to make sure costs are maintained within expected levels and to assure a high level of quality services 
facility occupancy is important as higher occupancy generally leads to higher revenue 
according to the ohio health care association  average nursing home occupancy within ohio was for over the past years  occupancy has averaged statewide according to the state of ohio 
according to the american health care association  median nursing facility occupancy rates were nationally for certified beds 
our skilled nursing facilities averaged for and assisted living facilities averaged 
for  our skilled nursing facilities averaged and assisted living facilities averaged 
statewide averages are not published for assisted living facilities 
on may   we completed our acquisition of the lincoln lodge 
the lincoln lodge is a unit senior living facility located in columbus  ohio 
this acquisition was effective april  consequently  many of the expense areas in our income statement increased 
when acquired  the facility focused on providing independent living services to seniors and was approximately occupied 
since our acquisition  we have obtained a license to provide assisted living services and have started admitting assisted living residents 
it s our goal to fill the remaining vacant units with assisted living and begin replacing the current independent residents with assisted living residents through attrition 
during this transitional phase  our average assisted living occupancy may appear somewhat lower than in the past 
for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   overall occupancy in our assisted living centers decreased 
we have implemented changes at our skilled nursing facilities to improve occupancy and revenue and these changes appear to be working as occupancy rates have been increasing

we continue our work towards maximizing the number of patients covered by medicare where our profit margins are typically higher 
for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   overall occupancy in our skilled nursing centers increased approximately 
in july  the governor of the state of ohio signed into law the state biennial budget certain provisions of this budget contain modifications to medicaid reimbursement that affect our reimbursement beginning july  we have implemented operating changes in our skilled nursing facilities to help offset some of the negative impacts of the state budget changes 
however  we are receiving limited positive adjustments in our reimbursement while our costs of providing services continue to rise 
for the year ended december   medicaid covered residents of our skilled nursing facilities comprised approximately of our total skilled nursing facility residents 
the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  has recently adopted rules that it estimates will decrease aggregate medicare payments to skilled nursing facilities by approximately in federal fiscal year effective as of october   cms increased medicare rates for skilled nursing facilities by approximately for the federal fiscal year ending september   under a rule adding an annual update to account for inflation in the cost of goods and services

as a result  cms estimates that aggregate medicare payments will be reduced by approximately in fiscal year  on or after october  for the

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our sources of cash consist primarily of cash provided by operations supplemented by small lines of credit when necessary 
these sources have been sufficient to fund our continuing operations but have been historically insufficient to fund our acquisition growth strategy 
additionally  we incur significant legal  auditing and sarbanes oxley section compliance costs necessary to continue as a public company 
although we have successfully integrated these costs into the cash flow from our operations  these costs have further limited our ability to grow through acquisitions 
we plan to improve liquidity by refinancing debt where possible to obtain more favorable terms  increasing facility occupancy  add additional management contracts and expand our home health operations and engage financial advisors to assist the company in identifying  evaluating and securing alternative capital  financing and investment sources to fund the company s strategic business plan 
on december   at a special shareholder meeting  shareholders approved the sale of  shares of stock and warrants in a private placement 
the offering consisted of units with each unit containing one share of the company s common stock and one five year warrant to purchase an additional share of common stock at per share 
each unit was priced at 
the offering was not registered under the securities act of and was only sold in the united states pursuant to applicable exemptions from registration 
as a result the company raised approximately  after commissions and expenses 
we plan to use the proceeds primarily for growth through acquisitions 
overview we had net working capital as of december  of approximately  as compared to negative net working capital of approximately  for the year ended december   an improvement of approximately  the improvement is a result of cash generated by operations and cash raised in our private offering 
on november   we established a  line of credit with huntington national bank to assist with cash flow 
as of december   the entire line of credit was available for use in operations of the company 
we are currently working with our primary lender to increase our line of credit but there are no assurances we will be successful or that the increase can be obtained at favorable terms 
we have established a  line of credit using funds from our non qualified deferred compensation plan 
members of this plan  which is only available to senior management  authorized the transfer of funds to establish the line of credit with interest accruing at 
we withdrew  from the deferred employee compensation plan see note to the consolidated financial statements and deposited the funds into an interest bearing savings account 
we intend to use the savings to fund temporary operating cash short falls 
we repaid the withdrawn funds to the plan at the end of with interest that accrued at 
in january   we reestablished the line of credit from the non qualified deferred compensation plan with same terms as the funds are presently used in the operations of the company 
our properties are financed with loans secured by the department of housing and urban development hud 
these loans restrict our use of the cash generated by the properties for purposes other than to fund the operations of the hud financed property 
in january and july each year  we are permitted to withdraw cash from these properties if a calculation of cash flow determines that the properties have generated cash in excess of what is needed to fund the expenses of the property in the short term 
when the calculation indicates there is available cash  we withdraw the funds from the property and deposit them in an interest bearing checking account and hold them for future use in operations 
there was approximately  of cash that was subject to these requirements representing approximately of our total cash balance as of december  in november  we completed the acquisition of hearth home of van wert as required by our forward purchase contract to acquire the outstanding partnership interest in hearth home of van wert by october the cost of acquiring the partners interest was approximately  and was primarily satisfied with cash received at the closing of financing for hearth care of greenfield and with a note payable to the sellers of approximately  bearing interest of due in november  a note payable to a seller of  that bears no interest but for which interest has been imputed at resulting in a discount of approximately  total notes payable to sellers are approximately  
table of contents notes payable and other debt for the year ended december  and the year ended december   we had notes payable and other debt outstanding of  and  respectively with weighted average interest rates of 
approximately of our debt is now at a variable interest rate compared to approximately in as a result of refinancing loans that were previously at a variable interest rate to fixed interest rate loans 
we project a change of in interest rates could result in a change in interest expense of approximately  annually 
on june  we completed the refinancing of three assisted living properties known as community s hearth home 
this refinancing replaced our adjustable rate demand taxable notes  series bonds in the original principal amount of  obtained in interest on the note was indexed at the libor rate 
we refinanced this debt with two hud insured loans at a fixed interest rate of with a year amortization 
the new financing consists of two loans  one for the two springfield  ohio properties and one for the urbana  ohio property 
the new loans are in the amount of  and  respectively  and total  as a result of this refinancing  in june  we recognized the balance of the unamortized financing costs of approximately  from the bond financing

note payable to stockholder for the year ended december  and the year ended december  note payable to stockholder was  and  respectively  with interest rates of approximately 
the loan originally matured in may but was extended to may however  in july   we completed refinancing  of this loan with a bank loan leaving a balance due on our note payable to stockholder of  as of december  in august  the loan was extended to december cash flow activities that affect our cash flows from operations are numerous 
for instance  the acuity of our assisted living residents affects the monthly fees we charge them and the fees increase in relation to the level of services required to take care of them 
in the skilled nursing facilities  patients who are covered under medicare are paid higher reimbursement rates than patients who are covered under medicaid 
also  the length of stay in our nursing homes affects cash flow 

table of contents our cash requirements are satisfied primarily with cash generated from operating activities and debt 
our cash flow is dependent on our ability to collect accounts receivable in a timely manner 
accounts receivable collections in the health care industry can be very complex processes 
at december   approximately of our skilled nursing facility residents were covered by the medicaid and medicare programs 
these are reliable payment sources which make our likelihood of collection very high 
however  the time it takes to receive payment on a claim from these sources can be long 
on average  accounts receivable were outstanding nearly days before collection as of december  which is lower than december  days of the status of collection efforts is monitored very closely by our senior management 
see additional discussion under patient care receivables in the critical accounting policies and use of estimates on page december  as compared to december  during  we satisfied our cash requirements primarily with cash generated from operating activities 
our cash was used principally for the operations of our properties 
cash provided by operating activities was approximately  as a result of decreased accounts receivable and increased other liabilities offset by increased prepaid expenses  other assets and decreased accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and december  was approximately  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of increasing restricted cash to satisfy hud s requirement for reserves for replacement of fixed assets and the purchase of property  plant and equipment for approximately  for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of satisfying the forward purchase contract for approximately  and the purchase of property  plant and equipment for approximately  for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  and was primarily the result of raising approximately  in a private sale of our stock offset by routine principal payment on our loans 
other activity included proceeds from notes payable generated through refinancing one of our properties with hud in november the proceeds were used to repay the principal on the former loan 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  and was the result of cash received upon refinancing certain loans offset by repayments on the original loans 
repayments on note payable to stockholder were the result of refinancing the loan with traditional bank debt 
repayments on notes payable were the result of refinancing existing debt as well as routine debt repayments 
inflation the resident fees that we receive from the properties that we own or lease and the management fees we receive from the facilities we manage for third parties are our primary sources of income at this time 
this source of income is affected by the monthly rental rates and the occupancy rates 
the monthly rental rates are dependent on various factors including competition  market conditions and the locations of the properties 
we evaluate and prepare budgets for our properties on an annual basis 
at that time  we assess the impact of inflation on the operations of the properties  including but not limited to  budgeting increases for real estate taxes  utilities  employee expenses  food and supplies 
however  some factors are difficult to quantify  such as potential increases in employee expenses as a result of the current shortage of qualified nurses  and there can be no assurance that the resident rental rates will increase or that costs will not increase due to inflation or other causes 
we strive to be the provider of choice in each of our markets and to charge market or better than market rates 

table of contents critical accounting policies and use of estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience  business knowledge and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
these estimates are evaluated by management and revised as circumstances change 
we believe that the following are critical accounting policies our financial statements reflect consolidation with entities in which we have determined to have a controlling financial interest arrangements with other business enterprises are evaluated  and those in which adcare is determined to have controlling financial interest are consolidated 
asc topic  consolidation addresses the consolidation of business enterprises to which the usual condition of consolidation ownership of a majority voting interest does not apply 
this interpretation focuses on controlling financial interests that may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests 
it concludes that  in absences of clear control through voting interests  a company s exposure variable interest to the economic risks and potential rewards from the variable interest entity s assets and activities are the best evidence of control 
if an enterprise holds a majority of the variable interests of an entity  it would be considered the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the variable interest entity in its financial statements 
adcare has evaluated its relationship with community s hearth home and hearth home of urbana and has determined that these entities are variable interest entities and that adcare holds variable interests in these entities 
furthermore  the company determined that it is the primary beneficiary of these variable interests and that the entities are required to be consolidated in accordance with asc topic  consolidation 
patient care receivables patient care receivables are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
the administrators and managers of our properties evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis  and adjustments are made if necessary 
on an ongoing basis  we have experienced very few collection problems and do not anticipate significant increases unless the economy where our properties are located encounters a severe down trend 
approximately of our revenue in our nursing facilities is derived from medicare and medicaid qualifying residents 
charges to these payers are evaluated monthly to insure that revenue is recorded properly and that any adjustments necessitated by our contractual arrangement with these payers are recorded in the month incurred 
long lived assets and goodwill we account for our long lived assets of property  plant and equipment other than goodwill by applying the provisions of codification topic intangibles goodwill and other 
we review the value of our long lived assets on an annual basis or sooner if required for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the determination and measurement of an impairment loss under these accounting standards requires the significant use of judgment and estimates based on many factors which can be subject to changing circumstances 
some of the changing circumstances could be market conditions  interest rates  competition and the economy 
beginning january   we accounted for goodwill under the provisions of codification topic intangibles goodwill and other  which requires us to no longer amortize goodwill 
we now test goodwill on an annual basis for the purpose of assessing the potential of its impairment and making the appropriate adjustments if required 
we no longer amortize costs associated with the acquisition of certificates of need required in ohio for nursing homes 
incentive stock option plan through december   we accounted for our employees stock option plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation is reflected in net income  as all options granted under our plans are at an exercise price equal to the 
table of contents market value of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant 
there had been no market for our common stock  accordingly  the exercise price established at time of grant was based on the judgment of the option committee 
effective january   we began accounting for options by applying the fair value recognition provisions of codification topic  stock compensation  the effects of which are included in our financial statements for the year ended december  and recent accounting pronouncements accounting standards codification during  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles as codified in the asc topic  generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas makes the fasb accounting standards codification asc the single source of authoritative accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the asc does not change gaap  but introduces a new structure  organized by accounting topics  designed to simplify user access to all authoritative literature related to a particular topic 
all prior authoritative documents were superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the asc is considered nonauthoritative 
as a result  prior gaap references are no longer applicable 
where applicable  the company has replaced prior gaap references with the new asc references 
revenue recognition in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which amends asc topic  revenue recognition 
this asu requires companies to allocate revenue in multiple element arrangements based on an element s estimated selling price if vendor specific or other third party evidence of value is not available 
this asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
postretirement benefit plans during  the company adopted the fasb staff position fsp no 
fas r employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets as codified in the asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
this fsp requires more detailed disclosures about employers plan assets in a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan  including employers investment strategies  major categories of plan assets  and concentrations of credit risk within plan assets and inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets 
this fsp also requires disclosure of the effects of measurements on changes in plan assets for the period for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs 
as this fsp is only disclosure related  the adoption does not impact the company s results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in addition  adcare does not offer this type of plan at this time 
business combinations effective january   we adopted asc topic  business combinations 
these new standards significantly change the financial accounting and reporting of business combination transactions and noncontrolling or minority interests in consolidated financial statements 
this standard requires companies to recognize  with certain exceptions  all assets acquired and liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in acquisitions of less than a percent controlling interest at their acquisition date fair value  recognize contingent consideration at the acquisition date fair value  with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings  recognize preacquisition loss and gain contingencies at their acquisition date fair values  capitalize in process research and development acquired at fair value  expense as incurred  acquisition related transaction costs  generally expense acquisition related restructuring costs  and recognize changes in existing income tax valuation allowances and tax uncertainty accruals that result from a business combination transaction as adjustments to income tax expense 

table of contents we did not enter into any business combination transactions during  and therefore  the effect of implementing these standards will be dependent upon the nature and extent of future business combination transactions 
asc topic  consolidation establishes new accounting and disclosure reporting requirements for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
the new standard requires that a noncontrolling interest in a consolidated subsidiary be recorded as a separate component of equity 
gains or losses are not recognized on sales  they are recorded as increases or decreases in paid in capital  unless there is a loss of control 
the adoption of this standard does not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets as codified in the asc topic  transfers and servicing 
sfas eliminates the exceptions for qualifying special purpose entities qspe from the consolidation guidance and clarifies the requirements for isolation and limitations on portions of financial assets eligible for sale accounting 
in addition  sfas requires enhanced disclosures about the risks that a transferor continues to be exposed to because of its continuing involvement in transferred financial assets 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the impact that adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
n june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r as codified in the asc topic  consolidation 
sfas revises guidance on when a variable interest entity vie should be included in consolidated financial statements 
sfas replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a vie with an approach focused on indentifying which reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the topic provides guidance on various methods used to measure fair value including market  income and cost approaches 
these approaches require the company to utilize certain assumptions about risk 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated  or generally unobservable inputs 
the company attempts to utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques  the company is required to classify the inputs under a fair value hierarchy that ranks the inputs based on their quality and reliability 
financial instruments carried at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data 
level unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data 
the estimated fair values of the company s short term financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  receivables and payables arising in the ordinary course of business  and current portions of debt  approximate their individual carrying amounts due to the relatively short period of time between their origination and expected realization
