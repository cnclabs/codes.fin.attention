var disclosure of commodity price risk the potential impact on our future earnings  as measured by var  was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the following table sets forth the average  high and low var calculations for the periods indicated years ended december  value at risk millions of dollars average high low our var calculation includes derivatives  executory storage and transportation agreements and their related hedges 
the variations in the var data are reflective of market volatility and changes in our portfolio during the year 
the decrease in average var for  compared with  was due primarily to price fluctuations between various locations and a decrease in the overall position of our portfolio in our var calculation uses historical prices  placing more emphasis on the most recent price movements 
we calculate the var on our mark to market derivative positions  which reflects the risk associated with derivatives whose change in fair value will impact current period earnings 
var associated with these derivative positions was not material during or to the extent open commodity positions exist  fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably 
as a result  we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business  operating results or financial position 

table of contents interest rate risk general we are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuation in the normal course of business 
we manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt  floating rate debt and  at times  interest rate swaps 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates 
floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates 
at december   the interest rate on all of oneok and oneok partners long term debt was fixed 
fair value hedges at december   we were not using any interest rate swaps 
see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for discussion of the impact of interest rate swaps and net interest expense savings from terminated swaps 
total net swap savings for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
total swap savings for are expected to be million 
currency exchange rate risk as a result of our energy services segment s operations in canada  we are exposed to currency exchange rate risk from our commodity purchases and sales related to our firm transportation and storage contracts 
to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  we use physical forward transactions  which result in an actual two way flow of currency on the settlement date since we exchange us dollars for canadian dollars with another party 
we have not designated these transactions for hedge accounting treatment  therefore  the gains and losses associated with the change in fair value are recorded in net margin 
at december  and  our exposure to risk from currency transactions gains and losses was not material 
the currency transaction gain recognized during was immaterial 
we recognized a currency transaction loss of million and a currency transaction gain of million during and  respectively 
counterparty credit risk oneok and oneok partners assess the creditworthiness of their counterparties on an ongoing basis and require security  including prepayments and other forms of collateral  when appropriate
