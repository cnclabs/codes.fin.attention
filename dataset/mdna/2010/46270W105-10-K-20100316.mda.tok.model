item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview iris international  inc consists of three operating units in two business segments as determined in accordance with fasb asc topic segment reporting 
our in vitro diagnostics  or ivd  segment also called iris diagnostics division  designs  manufactures and markets ivd systems  consumables and supplies for urinalysis and body fluids 
with the acquisition of leucadia technologies  inc  or leucadia  in we created our iris molecular diagnostics  or imd  subsidiary whose operations are included as part of the iris diagnostics division 
our sample processing segment markets small centrifuges and other processing equipment and accessories for rapid specimen processing 
the initial applications for our technology have been in the urinalysis market and we are the leading worldwide provider of automated urine microscopy systems  with more than  iq microscopy analyzers in over countries 
we generate revenues primarily from sales of ivd instruments  ivd consumables and service and sample processing instruments and supplies 
revenues from ivd instruments include sales of urine microscopy and chemistry analyzers manufactured by us and a urine chemistry analyzer  the aution max ax  sourced from a japanese manufacturer 
we sell our urine microscopy analyzers worldwide 
we initiated sales of the ichem velocity  our fully automated chemistry analyzer internationally in september sales of this instrument in the united states will be initiated upon us obtaining fda clearance 
we currently distribute the aution max ax in the united states  and have secured sufficient inventory of this product to cover all domestic sales of fully automated chemistry analyzers through the second half of consumables include products such as chemical reagents and urine test strips 
service revenues are derived primarily from annual service contracts purchased by our domestic customers after the initial year of sale  which is covered by product warranty and spare parts purchased by international customers 
once the analyzers are installed  we generate recurring revenue from sales of consumables 
consumable and service revenue are expected to continue to expand as the installed base of related instruments increases 
revenue is also generated from sales of sample processing instruments and related supplies  which primarily consists of centrifuge systems  dna processing workstations and blood analysis products 
domestic sales of our urinalysis systems are direct to the customer through our sales force 
international sales  with the exception of france and puerto rico where sales are direct to end use customers  are through independent distributors 
effective january  we completed the purchase of certain european distributor assets relating to the distribution of iris products in the united kingdom  ireland and germany 
we purchased the assets  which consist primarily of installed iris instruments leased to customers  the related lease agreements  and service contracts  for  this purchase will increase our direct sales presence within our international sales channels  and will serve as a template for further potential transactions in territories that represent new business opportunities for us 
we estimate that in  we will incur additional expense of approximately million to fund our new direct sales initiatives in the united kingdom  ireland and germany 
international sales represented of consolidated revenues for the years ended december  and since the substantial majority of international sales are made through independent distributors  gross profit margin is lower than for domestic sales of the same products  but we incur minimal sales and marketing costs for such sales 
our sample processing products are sold worldwide primarily through distributors 
as our company did not meet its revenue and earnings thresholds for the year ended december   the employee bonus expenses were significantly reduced by million as compared to the prior year 
the consolidated employee bonus expense for the years ended december  and amounted to  and million  respectively 
in february  after receiving reports of two incidents of uncontained rotor ruptures  we initiated a voluntary recall of  express centrifuge with a safety defect that could expose the user to personal injury or the biological sample being processed 
a retrofit program has been initiated to upgrade all units shipped since november at an estimated cost of  the installed base of approximately  centrifuges of all other models is not affected and we expect all units upgraded within the second quarter of we do not expect a material revenue impact from this incident 
in june  we initiated a reduction in force of full time equivalent personnel which resulted in a charge of  during the second quarter of the reduction in force generated approximately million in annualized savings 
in  we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with idexx laboratories  inc  or idexx  for internal centrifugal drive systems and related whole blood separators developed by us for use in the new idexx catalyst dx chemistry analyzer for the veterinary market launched globally by idexx in under the terms of the agreement  in exchange for a million cash payment and future royalties starting in  we granted idexx exclusive rights to manufacture the whole blood separator technology 
in addition  we will exclusively manufacture and sell to idexx the internal centrifugal drive system we developed 
shipments of this drive system commenced in we have invested significant capital to acquire technologies and to increase our investment in research and development both to sustain our technological leadership in our existing core product lines in urinalysis and sample processing and as part of our growth strategy to broaden our product pipeline into new high value platforms in hematology and molecular diagnostics 
the decision to diversify into ivd market segments in which we do not presently participate has adversely affected our earnings growth over the last four years  as we have invested significantly in research and development without any corresponding revenues from new products still in development 
our investment in new product platforms  however  is of strategic importance and is necessary to position the company for significant revenue and earnings acceleration in future years 
research and development expense increased to million  or of revenue  in compared to million  or of revenue  in of these expenditures  approximately million and million was invested in and  respectively  in our nadia and hematology platforms 
the expected release of our nadia prosvue in represents the first product offering resulting from our product line expansion initiative  and we are expecting significant revenue realization from this product starting in for  we anticipate that research and development expense will increase to approximately of revenue 
the following table summarizes product technology expenditures for the periods indicated in thousands total product technology expenditures during year less amounts capitalized during year to software development costs as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flow less amounts reimbursed through grants for government sponsored research and development research and development expense as reported in the consolidated statements of income critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations require us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we regularly discuss with our audit committee the basis of our estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenues are primarily derived from the sale of ivd instruments  sales of consumable supplies and services for ivd systems as well as sales of sample processing instruments and related supplies 
revenue is recognized once all of the following conditions have been met i an authorized purchase order has been received in writing with a fixed and determinable sales price  ii customer credit worthiness has been established  and iii delivery of the product based on shipping terms 
revenue is recorded in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc topic revenue recognition  which generally require revenue earned on product sales involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements if sold separately 
multiple elements of certain domestic product sales include ivd instruments  training  consumables and service 
accordingly  we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the element s respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately and specifically defined in a quotation or contract 
a portion of our revenues are derived from sales type leases as we provide lease financing to certain customers that purchase our diagnostic instruments 
leases under these arrangements are classified as investment in sales type leases 
these leases typically have terms of five years 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized when collectibility of the minimum lease payments is reasonably predictable and no important uncertainties surround the amount of unreimbursable costs yet to be incurred by us as lessor under the lease 
the minimum lease payments that accrue to our benefit as lessor are recorded as the gross investment in the lease 
the difference between the gross investment in the lease and the sum of the present value of the minimum lease payments and unguaranteed residual value  accruing to our benefit as lessor  are recorded as unearned income 
we have certain government contracts with cancellation clauses or renewal provisions that are generally required by law  such as i those dependant on fiscal funding outside of a governmental unit s control  ii those that can be cancelled if deemed in the tax payers best interest  and iii those that must be renewed each fiscal year  given limitations that may exist on multi year contracts that are imposed by statute 
under these circumstances and in accordance with the relevant accounting literature  as well as considering our historical experience  a thorough evaluation of these contracts is performed to assess whether cancellation is remote or whether exercise of the renewal option is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenues from service contracts ratably over the term of the service period  which typically ranges from twelve to sixty months 
payments for service contracts are generally received in advance 
deferred revenue represents the revenues to be recognized over the remaining term of the service contracts 
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out basis 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on management s analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts 
since the introduction of our iq product line  the installed base of our legacy analyzers have been steadily declining and less than units internationally and units domestically remain in the field as of december  we maintain a base supply of service parts for these products 
management will periodically review the carrying value of such parts to ensure that they continue to exceed net realizable value 
goodwill and core technology our intangible assets consist of goodwill  which is not being amortized and core technology  which is being amortized over its useful life of years 
all intangible assets are subject to impairment tests on an annual or periodic basis 
goodwill is evaluated in accordance with fasb asc topic  the intangibles goodwill and other  based on various analyses  including a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value and discounted cash flow 
the analysis necessarily involves significant management judgment to evaluate the capacity of an acquired business to perform within projections 
core technology is evaluated for impairment using the methodology set forth in fasb asc topic  property  plant and equipment 
recoverability of these assets is assessed only when events have occurred that may give rise to a potential impairment 
when a potential impairment has been identified  forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the long lived assets present in that operation 
if such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts  long lived assets  including such intangibles  are written down to their respective fair values 
at december   we evaluated goodwill and determined that fair value had not decreased below carrying value and no adjustment to impair goodwill was necessary in accordance with asc topic substantially all of the goodwill resides in the ivd reporting unit 
capitalized software we capitalize certain software development costs in connection with our development of our urine analyzers in accordance with fasb asc topic  software 
we capitalize software development costs once technological feasibility is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable against future revenues 
capitalized software development costs are expensed to cost of sales over periods up to five years 
when  in management s estimate  future revenues will not be sufficient to recover previously capitalized software development costs  we will expense such items as additional software development amortization in the period the impairment is identified 
such adjustments are normally attributable to changes in market conditions or product quality considerations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc topic  income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense represents the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb asc topic which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on various related matters such as derecognition  interest  penalties and disclosures required 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation under fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc which requires compensation costs related to share based transactions  including employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value 
results of operations the following table summarizes results of operations data for the periods indicated 
the percentages in the table are based on total revenues with the exception of percentages for gross profit margins which are computed on related revenue

income tax percentage is computed based on the relationship of income taxes to pre tax income 
comparison of year ended december  to revenues for the year ended december  decreased by over the prior year to million from million in revenues in the ivd urinalysis segment decreased to million in  from million in the prior year 
sales of ivd instruments decreased to million from million in the prior year as a result of a significant shortage of capital in the global markets 
our unit volume of iq analyzers sold during decreased approximately compared to  with domestic units decreasing and internationally units decreasing 
international revenues accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue for both and sales of ivd consumables and service increased during the year to million from million  an increase of over  primarily due to the larger installed base of instruments and the success of converting expiring warranty agreements to service agreements 
revenues derived from sample processing instruments and supplies increased to million  a increase over revenues of million 
this growth was driven by continued strong sales of our new express centrifuge along with an increase in orders from our international distributors  most notably our distributor in the united kingdom 
overall gross profit margins increased to in compared to in the gross profit margin of our ivd instruments was in versus in as compared to the prior year period  ivd instrument gross margin in was impacted by  in sales promotions   in costs related to the ichem velocity  which included velocity retrofit costs of  volume and other costs of  severance costs of approximately  with an offset of a reduction in employee bonuses of  in addition  our gross margins on ivd instruments were negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations on our purchases of aution max ax chemistry analyzers which are denominated in japanese yen 
the gross margin of our ivd consumables and service increased to during compared to in  respectively  and included  in international sales discounts 
the consumable gross margin improvement primarily resulted from economies of scale generated by our increasing volume of urine microscopy consumables and spare parts  improved efficiencies in our domestic service business  a reduction in unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations on purchases of dry chemistry strips denominated in japanese yen and a reduction of employee bonuses of  our chemistry strip manufacturing operation in germany continues to operate below capacity  but we expect to improve its utilization with increased demand for our proprietary urine chemistry test strips as a result of an increasing installed base our new ichem velocity automated urine chemistry analyzers in the mid to high volume segment of the urinalysis market 
gross profit margin for our sample processing instruments and supplies segment increased to in from in as a result of product mix  price increases and reduced headcount related to the reduction in force in the second quarter of in addition  the gross margin was affected by our sample processing division s voluntarily recall of approximately  centrifuges  requiring a  accrual to cover the product retrofit costs during the fourth quarter of marketing and selling expenses totaled million  or of revenues  in as compared to million  or of revenues in the increase includes personnel and related costs of  partially offset by lower commission and gpo fees of  travel and entertainment of  a reduction of employee bonuses of  and professional fees of  our  increase in personnel and related costs includes  in start up expenses relating to the initiation of direct sales in the united kingdom  ireland and germany 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues  in  from million or of revenues in this increase includes additional personnel and related costs of  stock based compensation expense of  professional fees of  board compensation expense of  an accrual of  for payroll taxes attributable to the exercise of stock options  other corporate related expenses of approximately  and an offset of  for a reduction in employee bonuses 
research and development expense increased to million  or of revenues  in from million  or of revenues in the increase includes research materials  consulting  clinical development expenses and software capitalization of million as we continue to invest heavily in research and development for the continued development of our diagnostics product pipeline  including our nadia platform and gems urinalysis and hematology programs 
these costs were partially offset by a reduction in employee bonuses of  interest income during amounted to  a  decrease over mainly due to a lower interest rate environment on our cash balances  and in spite of a higher cash balance 
income tax expense during the year amounted to of pre tax income as compared to during the prior year 
the decrease in the income tax provision resulted from an increase in research and development tax credits 
we have federal and state research and development and other tax credit carryovers totaling million 
comparison of year ended december  to revenues for the year ended december  increased by over the prior year to million from million in revenues in the ivd urinalysis segment increased to million in  from million in the prior year 
sales of ivd instruments increased to million in from million in the prior year 
our unit volume of iq analyzers sold during increased approximately with the number of units sold domestically remaining constant whereas the number of units sold internationally increased 
total international revenues accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue during compared to during sales of ivd consumables and service increased during to million from million  an increase of over  primarily due to the larger installed base of instruments and the success of converting expiring warranty agreements to service agreements 
revenues from the sample processing instruments and supplies increased during to million up from million  a increase over this growth was primarily driven by the new express centrifuge partially offset by declining sales of more mature products  such as the express centrifuge 
overall gross profit margins increased from in to in the gross profit margin of our ivd instruments was in versus in  as the launch in of the ichem velocity carried higher start up manufacturing costs such as manufacturing learning curve  training and higher material costs due to small lot procurement in the initial stages 
in addition  our gross margins on ivd instruments were negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations on purchases of aution max ax chemistry analyzers which are denominated in japanese yen 
the gross margin of our ivd consumables and service increased to during compared to in the consumable gross margin improvement primarily resulted from economies of scale generated by our increasing volume of urine microscopy consumables partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations on purchases of dry chemistry strips denominated in japanese yen 
our chemistry strip manufacturing operation continued to operate at below capacity during  which adversely affected margins 
in addition  during we experienced gross profit margin improvement in our domestic instrument service as a result of economies of scale and cost containments even with an increasing domestic installed base 
gross profit margin for our sample processing laboratory instruments and supplies segment remained constant at in and marketing and selling expenses totaled million  or of revenues  in as compared to million  or of revenues in the increase includes additional personnel and related costs of million  primarily relating to new product introductions  and professional and gpo fees of  and other expenses of  general and administrative expenses amounted to million  or of revenues  in  as compared to million or of revenues in this increase includes additional personnel and related costs of million most of which is attributed to a significant investment in information technology staff needed to improve our business systems 
in addition  our board compensation expense and corporate insurance increased in by  and other corporate expenses increased by  partially offset by a reduction in professional fees for audit and sox services of  research and development expense for the year ended amounted to million and the year ended amounted to million 
the increase includes million in personnel and related expenses  and an increase in clinical development related expenses of  these costs were partially offset by a reduction in ichem velocity prototype and research materials totaling  a decrease in consultants  patent prosecution and other miscellaneous expenses  primarily related to the ichem velocity development of  and cost reductions as a result of the shutdown of our advanced digital imaging research subsidiary of  interest income during amounted to million  a  decrease over mainly due to a lower interest rate environment on our cash balances  and lower cash balances due to the use of cash to repurchase of our common stock during income tax expense during amounted to of pre tax income as compared to during the prior year 
the increase in the income tax provision resulted from a reduction in research and development tax credits 
other income from non recurring manufacturing transition rights of million during related to an agreement entered with idexx operations  inc idexx  in december this manufacturing  supply and transition agreement allows idexx to manufacture and distribute rotors compatible with the drives of idexx machines  and in exchange for the manufacturing transition rights  we received million with an offset of  related to research and development cost associated with the manufacturing transition rights 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table aggregates our expected minimum contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease commitments not included in the table above are normal recurring accounts payable or accrued expenses which are presented on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash from operations  which depends heavily on sales of our ivd instruments  consumables and service  as well as sales of sample processing instruments and supplies 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents amounted to million compared to million at december  adverse macro economic forces have been impacting our selling markets and the credit markets of our customers 
although the impact thus far has been relatively mild  we continue to face the following challenges deferrals of purchases due to decreases in capital budgets of our customers  delays in the purchasing cycle due to greater scrutiny of deals and increased internal competition for limited capital dollars  and a significant increase in requests for quotes for operating leases 
the aforementioned factors may lead to a decrease in revenue  an increase of deferred revenue  or could lead to installment cash collections that will affect our liquidity and capital resources 
operating cash flows 
cash provided by operations for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to cash provided by operations of million during the prior year 
in addition to the decrease in net income of million  we experienced a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  a million increase in investment in sales type leases and a  increase in inventories  which contributed to the reduced cash flow when compared to the prior year 
offsetting these reductions in cash flow were non cash items consisting of higher depreciation and amortization of  stock based compensation expense of million  and tax benefits from stock options exercises of  in addition  we experienced a million reduction in accounts receivable and a million reduction in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to a nonrecurring million payment from idexx labs  inc under the december  manufacturing  supply and transition agreement as compared to the prior year period 
the number of days sales in accounts receivable decreased to days at the end of compared to days for the prior year end 
the number of days sales in accounts receivable varies and extends due to extended payment terms for our international customers and the granting of an increased volume of extended payment terms for certain customers of our instrument sales and instrument  consumables and service mix 
our cash flow has been favorably affected by tax credit carryforwards 
as of december   we had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we continue to realize tax deductions from the exercise of certain stock options 
during the year ended december   we realized tax deductions of approximately  relating to this item 
during the year ended december   we paid federal and state taxes of million and  respectively 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities totaled million in  a million decrease from the prior year period primarily as a result of the sale of short term marketable securities of million  offset by a million reduction in purchases of short term marketable securities  a decrease in the purchase of property and equipment of  and a reduction in the capitalization of software development costs of  as compared to the prior year period 
financing activities 
cash used in financing activities totaled  during the year ended december   an million decrease from the prior year period primarily as a result of the reduction in the repurchase of common stock for retirement amounting to million  partially offset by a reduction in tax deduction benefits from the exercise of stock option of  and a  reduction in the issuance of common stock over the prior year 
we currently have a credit facility with a commercial bank consisting of a million revolving line of credit for working capital and a million line of credit for acquisitions and product opportunities 
the credit facility has variable interest rates  which will change from time to time based on changes to either the libor rate or the lender s prime rate 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the new credit facility 
we are subject to certain financial and non financial covenants under the credit facility with the bank and as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
in  our board of directors authorized two stock repurchase plans  which resulted in our purchase of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for approximately million during  and an additional  shares of our common stock for approximately million during on september   our chief executive officer exercised a stock option to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common with an exercise price of per share  on a net issue basis  in a transaction approved by the compensation committee of our board of directors 
we issued  shares of common stock to our chief executive officer  and retained  shares of common stock with an aggregate market value of  based on the last closing price of our common stock immediately prior to exercise of per share 
of this amount   was applied in payment of the aggregate exercise price of the stock options and  was applied in payment of payroll taxes arising from the option exercise 
these options had a term expiring on november  we believe that our current cash on hand  together with cash generated from operations and cash available under the credit facility with the bank will be sufficient to fund normal operations for the foreseeable future 
however  additional funding may be required to fund expansion of our business 
there is no assurance that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  now codified under fasb asc topic  software

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our business is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not invest in derivatives  foreign currency forward contracts or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we had no debt at december   thus were not subject to market risk for changes in interest rates on debt obligations 
we are subject to market risk for changes in interest rates on our short term investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in certificates of deposit and the market value of these investments fluctuate based on changes in interest rates 
foreign currencies we conduct business in certain foreign markets  primarily in the european union and asia 
our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar  primarily the euro 
we are subject to certain foreign currency risks in the importation of goods from japan and as a result of commercial operations in europe and asia 
our purchases from a major japanese ivd supplier are denominated in japanese yen 
these components represent a significant portion of our material costs 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars with the exception of france  where sales are denominated in euros 
fluctuations in the us dollar exchange rate for japanese yen and euros could result in increased costs for our key components and increased costs for commercial operations in europe 
to mitigate the potential impact of adverse fluctuations in the us dollar exchange rate for these currencies  we periodically purchase foreign currency forward contracts 
during the year ended december   we entered into such contracts for euros and japanese yen totaling  and million  respectively 
as of december   we do not have any remaining foreign currency forward contracts in japanese yen or euros
