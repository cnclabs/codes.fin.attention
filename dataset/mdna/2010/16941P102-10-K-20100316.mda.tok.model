the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in part ii  item of this report 
forward looking statements the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein and in the risk factors and forward looking statements summary set forth in the forepart of this annual report as well as the risk factors section above and are afforded the safe harbor provisions of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
readers should carefully review the risk factors disclosed in this annual report and other documents filed by us with the sec 
discussion we are engaged  through our china based indirect subsidiaries described below  in the development  manufacture  marketing and sale of over the counter  branded nutritional supplements and over the counter plant and herb based pharmaceutical and medicinal products 
our principal products are external use tcms 
we have evolved into an integrated manufacturer  marketer and distributor of external use tcm products sold primarily in the prc and through chinese domestic pharmaceutical chains 
recently  we have been expanding our worldwide sales effort as well 
prior to  we sold both our own manufactured products  as well as medicinal and pharmaceutical products manufactured by others on a contract basis  categorized by us as contract sales 
commencing in  we discontinued all of our contract sales as part of our revised strategic plan 
in  we achieved continued growth on the sale of our own product line through our sustained efforts to expand our distribution channels and promote our products 
for the year ended december   total revenues were  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net income was  or per share  in  compared to net income of  or per share  in the  and net income of  or per share  in  as calculated on a diluted basis for all periods presented 
all of our business is conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary  acpg which  in turn  wholly owns harbin tdr  and tdr s subsidiaries 
recent developments on april   tdr completed its acquisition of tianlong  a company that had a variety of medicines approved by the sfda and new medicine applications  and which was in the business of manufacturing external use pharmaceuticals 
tdr previously acquired the beijing sales office of tianlong in mid in connection with this transaction  tdr acquired of the issued and outstanding capital stock of tianlong from its sole stockholder  in consideration for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  consisting of  in cash  and  shares of our common stock valued at per share 
on april   tdr consummated its acquisition of haina  licensed as a wholesaler of tcm  bio products  medicinal devices  antibiotics and chemical medicines 
haina did not have an established sales network and was acquired for its primary asset  a gsp license issued by the heilongjiang province office of the sfda 
the sfda only issues such licenses to pharmaceutical resellers that maintain certain quality control standards 
the gsp license was issued as of december  and will expire on january  this gsp license has enabled us to expand our sales of medicinal products without having to go through a lengthy license application process 
in connection with this transaction  tdr acquired of the issued and outstanding capital stock of haina from its three stockholders in consideration for payment of approximately  on september   tdr acquired peng lai  from peng lai jin chuang group corporation 
peng lai  which has received good manufacturing practice gmp certification from the sfda  was organized to develop  manufacture and distribute pharmaceutical  medicinal and diagnostic products in the prc 
in connection with this transaction  tdr acquired all of peng lai s assets  including  without limitation  franchise  production and operating rights to a portfolio of twenty medicines approved by the sfda  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  million  consisting of approximately  million in cash  and  shares of our common stock valued at per share 
trends and uncertainties in  general worldwide economic conditions declined due to sequential effects of the sub prime lending crisis  general credit market crisis  collateral effects on the finance and banking industries  concerns about inflation  slower economic activity  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns 
however  since all of our business operations  and most of our sales  are currently conducted in the prc  we have not been greatly affected by the economic downtown 
we have benefited from the overall economic development in the prc in recent years and the increase in the number of elderly people in china  which together have resulted in increased expenditures on medicine in the prc  including tcms 
in fiscal  our sales model was focused on the creation of our own distribution channels 
therefore  we sold products directly to many smaller distributors and retail store locations 
in fiscal  we changed our business model and entered into distribution agreements with larger regional sales agents  who resell to smaller distributors and retail store locations 
in addition  we entered into contracts with nationwide chain pharmacies  such as nepstar  tong ren tang  jin xiang  and ren min tong tai 
through the extensive sales networks of these nationwide chains  we are able to reach all major metropolitan areas throughout the prc 
these changes to our product distribution channels resulted in our direct customer base decreasing from customers at december  to customers at december  our change of sales strategy in fiscal was initiated to improve product channel efficiencies  and to give us access to an increased number of ultimate purchasers 
we believe that these changes will lead to further increased revenue by extending the reach of its distribution network 
we also believe that  by reducing the number of customers we sell to directly  we will be able to streamline our accounts receivable management and collection  and reduce channel distribution costs 
these favorable cost variances are expected to be partially offset by product price incentives we grant to the larger agents with which we have contracted 
in fiscal  of our total revenues  or  was attributable to sales of other manufacturers products through contract sales 
one of the main manufacturers for which we resold products was tianlong 
on april   we acquired tianlong and were able to fully integrated tianlong s products  which we had been previously selling on a contract basis  into our marketing and distribution channels 
following the acquisition of tianlong we continued to phase out our contract sales and  as of the end of fiscal  we no longer sell other company s products on a contract basis 
historically  we signed agreements with suppliers that allowed us to hold extra raw materials at the cost of the suppliers 
as a result  we were able to minimize our own inventory carrying costs  and improve our cash management  by keeping the inventory at the minimum level required to support the short term sales 
however  due to the forecasts for certain cost increases of raw materials in fiscal  we began to increase our inventory levels toward the second half of results of operations for the years ended december   and revenue  cost of goods sold gross profit and gross profit margin the following table sets forth our revenues  cost of goods sold  gross profit and gross profit margin during the fiscal years ended december    and for the years ended december  in thousands variance variance revenues product sales net of sales allowance contract sales total revenues cost of goods sold cost of goods sold gross profit gross profit margin year over year to total revenues increased by approximately  or  from approximately  in the fiscal year ended december   to approximately  for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in our revenues is primarily attributable to increase in our product sales related to strong performances from our sales distribution channels  obtained by our hiring of additional direct territory managers and sales agents  our efforts to locate and cooperate with more reputable distributors for certain of our products  the increase in marketing and advertising expenditures of approximately  or  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  and the full year effect of sales of products of tianlong  which generated approximately  and approximately  in and  respectively  and peng lai  which generated approximately  and approximately  in and  respectively  two of the businesses we acquired in fiscal the increase in our product sales were partially offset by our discontinuance of all contract sales in fiscal  which we began to phase out in fiscal cost of goods sold increased by approximately  or  to approximately  in fiscal compared to the prior year 
this increase was directly related to an increase in sales 
gross profit increased by  from approximately  in to approximately  in our gross margin remained constant at approximately 
year over year to total revenues increased by approximately  or  from approximately  in the fiscal year ended december   to approximately  for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in revenue is primarily attributable to strong performances from our sales distribution channels  and our sales of products of tianlong and peng lai  which we acquired in fiscal product sales increased by in the year ended december   to approximately  from approximately  in this growth in sales is attributable to volume and our efforts to continue to develop our distribution channels by hiring additional direct territory managers and sales agents to assure that our products and their associated benefits are seen by those making or influencing the purchasing decisions  and our sales of products of tianlong and peng lai  which we acquired in fiscal contract sales of non manufactured products amounted to approximately  in the year ended december   or a significant decrease of approximately  from sales of approximately  in in  our sales model was focused on the creation of our own distribution channels 
therefore  we sold products directly to many smaller distributors and retail store locations 
in  we changed our business model and entered into distribution agreements with larger regional sales agents  which resell to smaller distributors and retail store locations 
in addition  we began entering into contracts with nationwide chain pharmacies 
in  tdr began to discontinue contract sales as part of its strategic goals 
our change of sales strategy in fiscal was initiated to improve product channel efficiencies  and to give us access to an increased number of ultimate purchasers 
we believe that these changes will lead to further increased revenue by extending the reach of our distribution network 
we also believe that  by reducing the number of customers we sell to directly  we will be able to streamline our accounts receivable management and collection  and reduce channel distribution costs 
these favorable cost variances are expected be partially offset by product price incentives we grant to the larger agents with which we have contracted 
cost of goods sold increased by approximately  or  from approximately  in the year ended december   to approximately  for the year ended december   as a direct result of increased sales activities  partially offset by a higher gross margin on our sales of tianlong products following the acquisition in april overall  our product gross margins decreased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  from january  thought april   revenues from tianlong contract sales were approximately  and gross profit from these sales were approximately  the gross margin from these sales were approximately  after our acquisition of tianlong  revenues from sales of tianlong products were approximately  and gross profit from these sales were approximately  the gross margin from these sales was approximately 
this increase in gross margin from sales of tianlong s products following the acquisition was offset by the decrease in gross margins related to sales of certain tdr s products due to our reduction in the sales prices of certain of our products to be competitive in the prc market 
sales by product line we believe that the most meaningful presentation of our products is by categories of method of delivery 
the following table sets forth our principal product categories based on application type  and the approximate amount and percentage of revenue from each of such product categories  during each of the fiscal years ended december    and for the years ended december  in thousands product category sales of sales sales of sales sales of sales patches ointments sprays diagnostic kits contract sales others total year over year to during the fiscal year ended december   we acquired tianlong april  haina april and peng lai september 
our revenues increased in compared to  primarily due to our cooperation with more reputable sales agents and distributors  which have been able to put our products in more extensive sales networks  and the full year effect of sales of products of tianlong and peng lai  two of the businesses we acquired in fiscal as a result of signing agreements with these distributors  the sales revenues for products in the patches  sprays  and diagnostic kits categories increased   and year over year 
the revenue increase of approximately  in the ointment category  and the revenue increase of approximately  in other products category  are primarily due to our increased spending in marketing and advertising for certain products in these categories 
tianlong s products generated approximately  and  in and  respectively 
revenue generated by tianlong s products are included in the ointment  spray and other product categories 
peng lai s products generated approximately  and  in and  respectively 
revenue generated by peng lai s products are included in the other product category 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our contract sales of approximately  due to our discontinuance of all contract sales as of january  out of the products we commercialized in fiscal year  products accounted for approximately of the total revenue 
out of the products we commercialized in fiscal year  products accounted for approximately of total revenue 
year over year to our increase in revenues in as compared to was due to a combination of our sale of products of tianlong and peng lai  two of the businesses we acquired in fiscal  as well as our internal growth driven by increases in the revenues of tdr and first 
our internal growth was driven by increases in the revenues of tdr  which increased from  in to  in and first  which increased from approximately  in to approximately  in these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our contract sales of approximately  or from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  due primarily to our discontinuance of contract sales of tianlong products following the acquisition of tianlong as of april  in  before tdr acquired tianlong  the majority of our contracts sales consisted of products purchased from tianlong 
in  tdr began to discontinue contract sales  and in  tdr discontinued contract sales as part of its strategic goals and  in tdr discontinued contact sales 
revenues derived from the sale of a tianlong product of approximately  and approximately  for and respectively  have been reallocated to each of the appropriate product categories to present a more appropriate measure of our revenues by product line 
following the tianlong acquisition  we were able to fully integrate tianlong s products into our marketing and distribution channels and increase overall sales 
as a result  we derived an aggregate of approximately  from the sale of tianlong s products for the remainder of  in addition to approximately  of contract sales of tianlong s products from january  through the tianlong acquisition 
prior to our acquisition of peng lai  as of september   peng lai had nominal production and operations 
following the acquisition  peng lai contributed revenue of approximately  to our total revenue in haina did not have an established sales network and was acquired only for its gsp license 
operating expenses the following table summarizes the changes in our operating expenses for the years ended december   and for the years ended december  in thousands variance variance operating expenses selling expense general and administrative expense depreciation and amortization research and development total operating expenses percentage of operating expenses to revenue year over year to total operating expenses increased by approximately  or  from approximately  in the fiscal year ended december   to approximately  for the fiscal year ended december  selling expenses increased by approximately  in compared with this increase was  primarily related to increased costs of advertising from approximately  in to approximately  in  resulting from our increased marketing and sales efforts 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased approximately  or  compared with this increase was primarily due to an expense for share based compensation  of approximately  for shares we issued in december depreciation and amortization expenses in increased by approximately  or  compared with this increase was primarily due to the amortization of certain proprietary technologies we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in the amount of approximately million  which are amortized over a period of years  and the full year effect of depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets we acquired in the business acquisitions we consummated in fiscal  in the amount of approximately million 
research and development expenses were approximately  in the year ended december   compared to approximately  for the increased r d expenses in were primarily due to our research and development of certain proprietary technologies 
set forth below is a table of our major research and development projects  respective stage of development and applicable expenses for major research and development expenses in fiscal in thousands projects stage expenses of total r d diagnostic kits products clinical trial injections projects clinical trial breast cancer technology efficacy testing  acute and long term toxicity testing patches products extraction optimization testing monoclonal antibody completed endostatin efficacy testing  acute and long term toxicity testing antroquinonol clinical trial radix isatidis granule and syrup production process optimization naftopidil dispersible tablets production process optimization sertraline hydrochloride capsules production process optimization total year over year to total operating expenses increased by approximately  or  from approximately  in the fiscal year ended december   to approximately  for the fiscal year ended december  selling expenses increased by approximately  in compared with the higher selling expenses are primarily related to increased costs of advertising  from approximately  in  to approximately  in  and increased sales commissions resulting from our increased revenues 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased approximately  or  over the the higher general and administrative expenses are primarily due to the increases in salaries and other administrative expenses resulting from the business acquisitions we made in fiscal in  we recorded share based compensation expense of  as compared to  in depreciation and amortization in increased by approximately  compared the higher depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily due to the increased tangible and intangible assets we acquired through the business acquisitions we consummated in we conduct our research and development activities both internally and through collaborative arrangements with universities and research institutions 
our research and development expenses were approximately  in the year ended december   compared to approximately  in the year ended december  the increased r d expenses in were primarily due to our taking over of the ongoing research and development projects in tianlong and peng lai because of these two acquisitions 
historically  our internal research and development activities have been conducted at our research  development and laboratory facilities located at the principal business offices of its wholly owned subsidiary  tdr 
in  our research and development projects consisted of a total of eight diagnostic kits 
these bio engineering projects were conducted by tdr s wholly owned subsidiary  first 
in  we spent an immaterial amount on research and development for these eight products  of which we received approval by the sfda of our ovulation diagnostic kit  our prostate cancer diagnostic kit and urine micro albumin colloid gold diagnostic kit were submitted to the sfda for approval  and the remaining five products were undergoing long term stability testing while we provided supplemental documentation to the sfda for these projects 
as previously discussed  in fiscal we acquired tianlong and peng lai 
as a result  we had projects in development in fiscal set forth below is a table of our research and development expenses for  classified by product category and stage of development stage of development by number of projects and us dollar amount in thousands category application and efficacy acute and long term toxicity long term stability pending sfda approval supplemental documentation sfda approval total bio engineering a b c eye drops nasal drops injections spray ointment suppository gel liquid total d  e a bio engineering projects include our endostatin cancer treatment drug  breast cancer drug and diagnostic kits 
the diagnostic kits are designed for testing for different cancers and viruses  such as prostate cancer  stomach cancer  ovarian cancer  rectal cancer  liver cancer  hepatitis b and c  human papilloma virus and mycoplasma virus 
diagnostic kits accounted for approximately of total r d expenditures in b in fiscal  we spent approximately  on research and development related to monoclonal antibodies  which represented approximately of our total r d expenses 
monoclonal antibodies are a bioactive substance produced naturally when human cells identify and resist pathogenic intrusion from outside 
monoclonal antibody technology can produce large amounts of pure antibodies 
therefore  monoclonal antibodies have tremendous applications in the field of diagnostics  therapeutics  and targeted drug delivery systems  not only for infectious disease caused by bacteria  viruses and protozoa but also for cancer  metabolic and hormonal disorders 
c in fiscal  we spent approximately  on our endostatin cancer treatment drug  which represented approximately of our total r d expenses 
endostatin is a cancer treatment drug that works by starving cancer cells by restricting the generation of blood vessels around cancer lesions  thereby inhibiting  to a degree  the source of nutrients upon which the cancer cells survive 
d except as set forth in notes b and c above  no single project represented a material amount of our total r d expenditures in fiscal e does not include costs for materials used in our r d projects 
our total r d expenditures for fiscal were approximately  liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents position  our working capital  and our cash flow activity as of december  and and for each of the years then ended as of december  in thousands  except ratio and days cash and cash equivalents current ratio quick ratio average accounts receivable collection days average inventory turnover days working capital inventories cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities as of december   cash and cash equivalents were approximately  as compared to  at december  we had working capital at december  of approximately  compared to  at december  our increase in working capital in was principally due to increased cash and cash equivalents funded by the increased cash flows generated from our operating activities of  we consider current working capital and borrowing capabilities adequate to cover our current operating and capital requirements for the full year cash flows provided by operating activities was approximately  for the year ended december  compared to  in cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily attributable to net income of approximately  and non cash depreciation and amortization of approximately  partially offset by accounts receivable of approximately  and inventories of approximately  cash flows used in investing activities was approximately  for the year ended december  compared to approximately  in cash flows used in investing activities in was primarily related to our purchase of properties and equipment in connection with the business acquisitions we consummated in cash flows used in investing activities in was primarily related to our expenditures in construction in progress of approximately million  in connection with our construction of our new corporate headquarters  as well as the purchase of proprietary technologies for antroquinonol  a drug used for treatment of lung and liver cancers in the amount of approximately million  and small rna diagnosing technology  used for detecting heart diseases in its early stage  in the amount of approximately million 
cash flows provided from financing activities was approximately  for the year ended december  compared to approximately  for the same period in our higher cash flows provided from financing activities in were primarily due to the private offering we completed in january   as well as cash generated from the exercise of warrants by certain warrant holders of ours 
in january  we completed the construction of two office buildings and moved into these new facilities 
it is anticipated that residual work  including road construction  fire control equipment  amenity improvement  and final acceptance  will be completed on these facilities in the third quarter of  at an additional cost of approximately million 
our current ratio was at december  compared to at december  and the quick ratio was at december  compared to at december  we endeavor to ensure that funds are available to take advantage of new investment opportunities and that funds are sufficient to meet future liquidity and capital needs 
we calculate accounts receivable turnover by averaging the opening and closing balances of out accounts receivable during that period and dividing that amount by our average daily sales during that period 
since accounts receivables fluctuate over the course of each quarter  in order to determine a more representative accountant receivables collection days  management calculates the turnover rate on a quarter by quarter basis 
in fiscal  we implemented our new sales strategy to contract with regional sales agents and large pharmacy chains rather than directly with smaller distributors and individual retail stores 
as a result  the number of customers we sell to directly has dramatically decreased from in to in this lower number of customers has helped us to better manage our accounts receivable 
in addition  we are now selling directly to more reputable local pharmacy chains  which pay earlier and more consistently 
our average daily sales and turnover for each quarter during and were as follows quarter ended average daily sales in thousands average a r in thousands turnover days march  june  september  december  annual average march  june  september  december  annual average accounts receivable turnover days fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the following sales revenue varies  which results in changing average daily sales  accounts receivable collections are slower during the fourth fiscal quarter and the first fiscal quarter  partly due to the chinese public holidays within that period about three weeks in total 
during the second and third quarter of each year  due to stronger sales volume  the product turnover rate at the company s distributors and agents is higher  resulting in their shorter accounts payable periods 
during and  our average inventory turnover was approximately and days  respectively 
since sales and costs of goods sold fluctuate over the course of each quarter  in order to determine a more representative inventory rate  management calculates inventory rate on a quarter by quarter basis  and then takes the average of the resulting numbers 
management calculates our inventory turnover rate using total inventory rather than just finished goods  because our production cycle is of an extremely short duration 
our inventory turnover days for the years ended december  and calculated by using average daily costs of goods sold and average inventory for each quarter were as the following quarter ended average daily cogs in thousands average inventory in thousands turnover days march  june  september  december  annual average march  june  september  december  annual average one reason for the quarterly fluctuations in our number of inventory turnover days is that  historically  our inventory is at its lowest levels at the end of each calendar year and in the first fiscal quarter 
we draw down our inventory levels in december of each year for two main reasons 
first  our customers want to receive goods prior to the holiday season 
in addition  the first calendar quarter is traditionally our slowest sales period 
since a lower volume of sales activity normally occurs during the first quarter of each calendar year  we believe it is prudent to avoid incurring unnecessary inventory carrying costs 
at the appropriate time toward the end of the first calendar quarter of each fiscal year  we begin to ramp up our inventory levels to prepare for increased demand during the coming stronger selling periods 
second  the number of inventory turnover days in each fiscal quarter of was lower than in the comparable quarter of  due to an increase in our revenues for each quarter in compared to the same quarter in the prior year 
inventory did not increase at the same level as revenues  which resulted in varying amounts of cost of goods sold  and a corresponding lower number of inventory turnover days 
historically  we signed agreements with suppliers that allowed us to hold extra raw materials at the cost of the suppliers 
as a result  we could minimize our own inventory carrying costs  and improve our cash management  by keeping the inventory at the minimum level required to support the short term sales 
however  due to the forecast of certain cost increases of raw materials in  management began to increase the inventory levels toward the second half of private offering on january  the closing date  we entered into a securities purchase agreement the purchase agreement with certain accredited investors the investors  for the purchase and sale of  units of our securities units consisting of an aggregate of i  shares of our common stock the purchased shares  and ii class a warrants to purchase  additional shares of our common stock  at an exercise price of per share the purchased warrants  for a purchase price of per unit the unit purchase price  or aggregate of  the offering 
in connection with the offering  we paid a placement agent the placement agent a fee of five percent of the offering proceeds 
in addition  we paid the placement agent s legal fees and additional out of pocket expenses related to the offering 
we used the net proceeds from the offering primarily for a acquisitions  b new product marketing  c expenses related to the offering and the registration statement defined below  and d general working capital purposes 
as of the closing date  we entered into a registration rights agreement the registration rights agreement with the investors  pursuant to which it agreed that within sixty calendar days of the closing date the filing date  we would file a registration statement the registration statement with the sec  on the appropriate form  covering the resale of i the purchased shares  and ii the common stock issuable upon exercise of the purchased warrants the warrant shares collectively i and ii  the registrable securities 
further  we agreed to use our best efforts to a cause the registration statement to be declared effective within one hundred twenty calendar days from the filing date  or  if reviewed by the sec  within one hundred fifty calendar days after the filing date  and b keep the registration statement continuously effective until all of the registrable securities have been sold  or may be sold without volume restrictions pursuant to rule the registration requirements 
we have not yet satisfied the registration requirements 
we engaged an independent third party consultant to calculate the derivative liability resulting from our failure to register the registrable securities for resale 
the calculation was made using the black scholes model 
the liability was deemed to be immaterial as of december  notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in the registration rights agreement  the company shall be entitled to limit the registrable securities to the extent necessary to avoid any issues arising from interpretations by the sec of rule of the securities act of  as amended 
the class a warrants represent the right to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  at an exercise price of per share the exercise price  and have the following additional characteristics the class a warrants shall be exercisable beginning on the six month anniversary of the closing date and will expire three years thereafter the expiration date  provided  however  if  among other things  we fail to cause a registration statement covering the warrant shares to be declared effective prior to the applicable dates set forth in the registration rights agreement the effectiveness deadlines  the expiration date of the class a warrants shall be extended one day for each day beyond the effectiveness deadlines 
commencing on one year anniversary of the closing date  in the event the warrant shares may not be freely sold by the holders the warrantholders due to our failure to satisfy our registration requirements  and an exemption for such sale is not otherwise available to the warrantholders under rule  the class a warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis 
the exercise price and number of warrant shares will be subject to adjustment for standard dilutive events  including the issuance of common stock  or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of common stock  at a price per share  or conversion or exercise price per share less than the exercise price 
at anytime following the date a registration statement covering the warrant shares is declared effective  we will have the ability to call the class a warrants at a price of per class a warrant  upon thirty days prior written notice to the holders of the class a warrants  provided i the closing price of the common stock exceeded for each of the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date that the call notice is given by us  and ii we have attained an adjusted eps of at least per share for the fiscal year ending december   as set forth in our audited financial statements 
the warrantholder shall not be entitled to exercise a number of class a warrants in excess of the number of class a warrants upon exercise of which would result in beneficial ownership by the warrantholder and its affiliates of more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
this limitation on exercise may be waived by written agreement between the warrantholder and us  provided  however  such waiver may not be effective less than sixty one days from the date thereof 
as of march   we have  class a warrants outstanding 
if all of these class a warrants were exercised for cash pursuant to their terms  we would receive  in proceeds  although there can be no assurance that any of these class a warrants or placement agent warrants will be exercised for cash 
significant accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which were utilized in the preparation of our financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december   we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k in conformity with us gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
significant estimates include values and assigned lives to acquired tangible and intangible assets  uncollectible accounts receivable  impairment testing of goodwill and other long lived assets 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for estimated bad debts is based upon the periodic analysis of individual customer balances including an evaluation of days of sales outstanding  payment history  recent payment trends  and perceived credit worthiness 
as of december  our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively 
inventories inventories include finished goods  raw materials  freight in  packing materials  labor  and overhead costs and are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
inventory units are valued using the weighted average method 
provisions are made for slow moving  obsolete and or damaged inventory based upon the periodic analysis of individual inventory items including an evaluation of historical usage and or movement  age  expiration date  and general conditions 
there are no inventory reserve provision recorded at december  and property and equipment property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation on property and equipment is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we use an estimated residual value of of cost  or valuation for both financial and income tax reporting purposes 
the estimated lengths of the useful lives of our property and equipment are as follows building and improvements years land use rights years furniture equipment to years transportation equipment to years machinery and equipment to years expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs are normally charged to the statement of operations in the year in which they were incurred 
in situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditure has resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of the asset  the expenditure is capitalized as an additional cost of the asset 
upon sale or disposal of an asset  the historical cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization of such asset is removed from their respective accounts  and any gain or loss is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
property and equipment are evaluated for impairment in value whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
if such an event or change in circumstances occurs and potential impairment is indicated because the carrying values exceed the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the asset  we will measure the impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
we did not record any impairment charges in the years ended december   and intangible assets intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized while intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine recoverability of its long lived assets  we evaluate the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the assets 
impairment costs  if any  are measured by comparing the carrying amount of the related assets to their fair value 
we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by the use of undiscounted future cash flows  independent appraisals or other approximate methods 
we did not record any impairment charges for the years ended december   and intangible assets consists of proprietary technologies  sfda licenses for drug batch numbers  and goodwill 
we acquired proprietary technologies from a non related third party 
the fair value of proprietary technologies recorded in our financial statements is appraised periodically and amortized during its estimated useful life 
sfda licenses for drug batch numbers were acquired through business acquisitions of tianlong and peng lai 
goodwill consists the payments we made when we acquired tianlong s beijing sales office and haina 
we have registered kang xi as our trademark  which is used for all of our tcm products 
the kang xi trademark was developed internally and registered by tdr before we became a public company 
our cost basis in the trademark is nominal 
therefore  we did not have our kang xi trademark appraised  or record an intangible asset for it 
additionally  none of the costs associated with the trademark have been capitalized 
as of december   the remaining weighted average life of our intangible assets is approximately years 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we believe that all of these criteria are satisfied upon shipment from its facilities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we do not invest or trade market risk sensitive instrument or have any debt subject to interest rate fluctuations 
substantially all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in rmb

currently  exchange rates are approximately rmb to us resulting in the increase in price of chinese products to us purchasers 
as our operations are primarily in china  any significant revaluation of the chinese rmb may materially and adversely affect cash flows  revenues and financial condition 
if we decide to convert rmb into us dollars and the us dollar appreciates against the rmb  the us dollar equivalent of the rmb that we convert would be reduced
