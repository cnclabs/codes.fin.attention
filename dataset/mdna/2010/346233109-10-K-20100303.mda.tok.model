table of contents background prior to december   we were a wholly owned subsidiary of temple inland inc on december   temple inland distributed all of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock to its shareholders in a transaction commonly referred to as a spin off 
strategy our strategy is to maximize and grow long term shareholder value through entitlement and development of real estate  realization of value from minerals  water and fiber resources  and strategic and disciplined investment in our business 
in first quarter  we announced our near term strategic initiatives to enhance shareholder value by generating significant cash flow  principally from the sale of about  acres of higher and better use hbu timberland

table of contents current market conditions current market conditions in the single family residential industry continue to be difficult  characterized by product oversupply  depressed sales volumes and prices  high unemployment rates and low consumer confidence 
in  most homebuilders continued to focus on balance sheet health and liquidity  making them reluctant to purchase new lots 
while all markets are being negatively affected by overall poor economic conditions  not all geographic areas and products have been affected to the same extent or with equal severity 
these difficult market conditions may continue throughout in  oil prices decreased compared with principally due to slower economic activity and reduced demand 
natural gas prices have remained depressed as production remains strong and the economic downturn has reduced demand resulting in increased inventory levels 
exploration and production companies remained conservative reducing capital expenditures for drilling and lease acquisition due to lower prices 
these conditions may impact the demand for new mineral leases  new exploration activity and the amount of royalty revenues we receive 
pulpwood demand is relatively stable in our markets 
the average price at which we sold fiber products is up principally due to our harvesting and selling a higher mix of larger pine sawtimber 
business segments in  we changed our reportable segments to reflect our post spin management of the operations transferred to us from temple inland

mixed use development the mixed use development we own consists of  acres planned to include about  residential lots and about commercial acres designated for multifamily and retail uses  of which lots and commercial acres have been sold through year end in  we entered into an agreement with the spid providing for reimbursement of certain infrastructure costs related to the mixed use development 
reimbursements are subject to review and approval by the spid and unreimbursed amounts accrue interest at percent 
the spid s funding for reimbursements is principally derived from its ad valorem tax collections and bond proceeds collateralized by ad valorem taxes  less debt service on these bonds and annual administrative and public service expenses 
through year end  we have submitted for reimbursement about  of infrastructure costs 
in  we received reimbursements totaling  at year end  we have about  in pending reimbursements  excluding interest 
since the amount we will be reimbursed is dependent on several factors  including timing of spid approval and the spid having an adequate tax base to generate funds that can be used to reimburse us  there is significant uncertainty as to the amount and timing of reimbursements under this agreement 
as a result  in amounts collected under this agreement were accounted for as a reduction of our investment in the 
table of contents mixed use development 
we have not recognized income from interest due  but not collected 
as these uncertainties are clarified  we will modify our accounting accordingly 
at year end  we have  invested in the mixed use development 
accounting policies critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements  we follow generally accepted accounting principles  which in many cases require us to make assumptions  estimates  and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
many of these principles are relatively straightforward 
there are  however  a few accounting policies that are critical because they are important in determining our financial condition and results of operations and involve significant assumptions  estimates and judgments that are difficult to determine 
we must make these assumptions  estimates and judgments currently about matters that are inherently uncertain  such as future economic conditions  operating results and valuations  as well as our intentions 
as the difficulty increases  the level of precision decreases  meaning actual results can  and probably will  differ from those currently estimated 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on a combination of historical experiences and other factors that we believe are reasonable 
we have reviewed the selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with our audit committee 
investment in real estate and cost of real estate sales in allocating costs to real estate owned and real estate sold  we must estimate current and future real estate values 
our estimates of future real estate values sometimes must extend over periods to years from today and are dependent on numerous assumptions including our intentions and future market and economic conditions 
in addition  when we sell real estate from projects that are not finished  we must estimate future development costs through completion 
differences between our estimates and actual results will affect future carrying values and operating results 
impairment of long lived assets measuring assets for impairment requires estimating future fair values based on our intentions as to holding periods  future operating cash flows and the residual value of assets under review  primarily undeveloped land 
depending on the asset under review  we use varying methods to determine fair value  such as discounting expected future cash flows  determining resale values by market  or applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
changes in economic conditions  demand for real estate  and the projected net operating income for a specific property will inevitably change our estimates 
share based compensation we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of other variables 
these variables include expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors term of option  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we have limited historical experience as a stand alone company so we utilized alternative methods in determining our valuation assumptions 
the expected life was based on the simplified method utilizing the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual life of the awards 
the expected stock price volatility was based on historical prices of our peers common stock for a period corresponding to the expected life of the options 
pre vesting forfeitures are estimated based upon the pool of participants and their expected activity 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant judgment is required to estimate our income taxes 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of federal and state tax laws 
we estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
if needed  we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based upon our analysis of the timing and reversal 
table of contents of future taxable amounts and our history and future expectations of taxable income 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  and changes in tax laws 
to the extent adjustments are required in any given period  we will include the adjustments in the tax provision in our financial statements 
these adjustments could materially impact our financial position  cash flow and results of operations 
oil and natural gas reserves the estimation of the oil and natural gas reserve is a significant estimate 
on an annual basis  our consulting petroleum engineering firm  with our assistance  prepares estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves based on available geologic and seismic data  reservoir pressure data  core analysis reports  well logs  analogous reservoir performance history  production data and other available sources of engineering  geological and geophysical information 
oil and natural gas prices are volatile and largely affected by worldwide or domestic production and consumption and are outside our control 
adopted and pending accounting pronouncements we adopted new accounting pronouncements in  the adoption of which did not have a significant effect on our earnings or financial position 
there are two new accounting pronouncements that we will be required to adopt in  and we are currently evaluating the effect if any  on our earnings or financial position 
please read note new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation inflation has had minimal effects on operating results the past three years 
our real estate  timber  and property and equipment are carried at historical costs 
if carried at current replacement costs  the cost of real estate sold  timber cut  and depreciation expense would have been significantly higher than what we reported 
legal proceedings we are involved in various legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of doing business 
we believe we have established adequate reserves for any probable losses  and we do not believe that the outcome of any of these proceedings should have a material adverse effect on our financial position  long term results of operations  or cash flow 
it is possible  however  that charges related to these matters could be significant to results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our interest rate risk is principally related to our variable rate debt 
interest rate changes impact earnings due to the resulting increase or decrease in the cost of our variable rate debt  which was  at year end and  at year end in and  our outstanding variable rate debt includes  notional amount interest rate swap which expires in march please read note derivative instruments for additional information regarding our interest rate swap agreement 
the following table illustrates the estimated effect on our pre tax income of immediate  parallel  and sustained shifts in interest rates for the next months on our variable rate debt at year end  with comparative year end information 

table of contents this estimate assumes that debt reductions from contractual payments will be replaced with short term  variable rate debt  however  that may not be the financing alternative we choose 
at year end change in interest rates in thousands changes in interest rates affect the value of our interest rate swap agreement  notional amount at year end 
we believe any change in the value of this agreement would not be significant 
foreign currency risk we have no exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
commodity price risk we have no significant exposure to commodity price fluctuations
