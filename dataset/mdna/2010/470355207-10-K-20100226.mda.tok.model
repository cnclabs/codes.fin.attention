item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and selected financial data included elsewhere in this filing 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of numerous factors  including the risks discussed in risk factors in this filing 
overview we mine  process and sell bituminous  steam and industrial grade coal through six operating subsidiaries mining complexes located throughout eastern kentucky and in southern indiana 
we have two reportable business segments based on the coal basins in which we operate central appalachia capp and the midwest midwest 
in  our mines produced million tons of coal including million tons of contract coal and we purchased another million tons for resale 
of the million tons we produced from company operated mines  approximately came from underground mines  while the remaining came from surface mines 
in  we generated revenues of million and net income of million 
capp segment in central appalachia  the majority of our coal is primarily sold to customers in the southern portion of the south atlantic region of the united states 
the south atlantic region includes the states of florida  georgia  south carolina  north carolina  west virginia  virginia  maryland and delaware 
according to the most recent information available from the us energy information administration eia  in the south atlantic region consumed million tons of coal or about of all coal for electric generation in the united states 
we have been providing coal to customers in the south atlantic region since our formation in in  georgia power company and south carolina public service authority were our largest customers  representing approximately and of our total revenues  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of our revenues 
according to the eia  coal production for eastern kentucky and west virginia was million tons in during  our capp segment shipped million tons of coal at an average selling price of per ton 
as of december   we estimate that we controlled approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in our caap segment 
based on our most recent analysis prepared by marshall miller associates  inc mm a as of march   we estimate that these reserves have an average heat content of  btu per pound and an average sulfur content of 
at current production levels  we believe these reserves would support approximately years of production 
midwest segment in the midwest  the majority of our coal is sold in the east north central region  which includes the states of illinois  indiana  ohio  michigan and wisconsin 
according to the eia  in the east north central region consumed about million tons of coal or of all coal consumed for electric generation in the united states 
in  our midwest segment s largest customer represented approximately of our total revenues 
during  our midwest segment shipped million tons of coal at an average selling price of per ton 
we believe that coal fired electric utilities and industrial customers value the high energy coal that comprises the majority of our midwest reserves 
as of december   we estimate that we controlled approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in our midwest segment 
based on our most recent analyses prepared by mm a as of february  and april   we estimate that these reserves have an average heat content of  btu per pound and average sulfur content of 
at current production levels  we believe these reserves would support approximately years of production 
reserves mm a prepared a detailed study of our capp reserves as of march  based on all of our geologic information  including our updated drilling and mining data 
mm a completed their report on our capp reserves in june for the triad properties  mm a also prepared a detailed study of triad s reserves as of february  for the reserves obtained in the acquisition of triad and as of april  for certain additional reserves acquired in the second quarter of the mm a studies were planned and performed to obtain reasonable assurance of the subject demonstrated reserves 
in connection with the studies  mm a prepared reserve maps and had certified professional geologists develop estimates based on data supplied by us and triad using standards accepted by government and industry 
we have used mm a s march  study as the basis for our current internal estimate of our central appalachia reserves and mm a s february  and april  studies as the basis for our current internal estimate of our midwest reserves 
reserves for these purposes are defined by sec industry guide as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
the reserve estimates were prepared using industry standard methodology to provide reasonable assurance that the reserves are recoverable  considering technical  economic and legal limitations 
although mm a has reviewed our reserves and found them to be reasonable notwithstanding unforeseen geological  market  labor or regulatory issues that may affect the operations  mm a s engagement did not include performing an economic feasibility study for our reserves 
in accordance with standard industry practice  we have performed our own economic feasibility analysis for our reserves 
it is not generally considered to be practical  however  nor is it standard industry practice  to perform a feasibility study for a company s entire reserve portfolio 
in addition  mm a did not independently verify our control of our properties  and has relied solely on property information supplied by us 
reserve acreage  average seam thickness  average seam density and average mine and wash recovery percentages were verified by mm a to prepare a reserve tonnage estimate for each reserve 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves as discussed in critical accounting estimates coal reserves 
based on the mm a reserve studies and the foregoing assumptions and qualifications  and after giving effect to our operations from the respective dates of the studies through december   we estimate that  as of december   we controlled approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in the capp region and millions tons in the midwest region 
the following table provides additional information regarding changes to our reserves since december  in millions of tons capp midwest total proven and probable reserves  as of december  coal extracted acquisitions adjustments divestures proven and probable reserves  as of december  calculated in the same manner  and based on the same assumptions and qualifications  as used in the mm a studies described above  but these estimates have not been reviewed by mm a 
proven reserves have the highest degree of geologic assurance and are reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings  or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspections  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable reserves have a moderate degree of geologic assurance and are reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
this reserve information reflects recoverable tonnage on an as received basis with moisture 
represents estimated reserves on leases entered into or properties acquired during the relevant period 
we calculated the reserves in the same manner  and based on the same assumptions and qualifications  as used in the mm a studies described above  but these estimates have not been reviewed by mm a 
represents changes in reserves due to additional information obtained from exploration activities  production activities or discovery of new geologic information 
we calculated the adjustments to the reserves in the same manner  and based on the same assumptions and qualifications  as used in the mm a studies described above  but these estimates have not been reviewed by mm a 
represents changes in reserves due to expired leases 
key performance indicators we manage our business through several key performance metrics that provide a summary of information in the areas of sales  operations  and general and administrative costs 
in the sales area  our long term metrics are the volume weighted average remaining term of our contracts and our open contract position for the next several years 
during periods of high prices  we may seek to lengthen the average remaining term of our contracts and reduce the open tonnage for future periods 
in the short term  we closely monitor the average selling price per ton asp  and the mix between our spot sales and contract sales 
in the operations area  we monitor the volume of coal that is produced by each of our principal sources  including company mines  contract mines  and purchased coal sources 
for our company mines  we focus on both operating costs and operating productivity 
we closely monitor the cost per ton of our mines against our budgeted costs and against our other mines 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are also measures used by management to measure operating performance 
we define ebitda as net income loss plus interest expense net  income tax expense benefit and depreciation  depletion and amortization 
we regularly use ebitda to evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and or tax rates 
in addition  we use ebitda in evaluating acquisition targets 
ebitda is not a recognized term under us gaap and is not an alternative to net income  operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with us gaap or an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of operating liquidity 
adjusted ebitda is used in calculating compliance with our debt covenants and adjusts ebitda for certain items as defined in our debt agreements  including stock compensation and certain bank fees 
see other supplemental information reconciliation of non us gaap measures 
in the selling  general and administrative area  we closely monitor the gross dollars spent per mine operation and in support functions 
we also regularly measure our performance against our internally prepared budgets 
trends in our business near term  the global economic slowdown has lowered demand for coal which has resulted in a decline in spot coal prices 
the price of spot coal has also been impacted by a decrease in the price of competing fuel sources including oil and natural gas 
the coal industry has made cutbacks in supply in response to decrease in demand for coal 
due to the uncertainties in the global market place  we are unable to forecast the price or demand for coal over the next few years 
long term  we believe that the demand for coal worldwide will continue to be strong as supply challenges will continue in the regions that we mine coal 
we also believe that in the united states coal will continue to be one of the most economical energy sources 
a number of factors beyond our control impact coal prices  including the supply of domestic and foreign coal  the demand for electricity  the demand for steel and the continued financial viability of the domestic and foreign steel industries  the cost of transporting coal to the customer  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  world economic conditions air emission standards for coal fired power plants  and the price and availability of alternative fuels for electricity generation 
as discussed previously  our costs of production have increased in recent years 
we expect the higher costs to continue for the next several years  due to a number of factors  including increased governmental regulations  high prices in worldwide commodity markets  and a highly competitive market for a limited supply of skilled mining personnel 
our business is very sensitive to changes in supply and demand for coal and we carefully manage our mines to maximize operating results 
as our current long term contracts are fulfilled  our profitability in the future will be impacted by the price levels that we achieve on future long term contracts 
events beyond our control could impact our profit margins 
results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the following table shows selected operating results for and in thousands  except per ton amounts year ended december  change total per ton total per ton total volume shipped tons coal sales revenue cost of coal sold depreciation  depletion and amortization gross profit loss   n a selling  general and administrative volume and revenues by segment year ended december  capp midwest capp midwest volume shipped tons coal sales revenue average sales price per ton in  we shipped million tons of coal compared to million tons in coal sales revenue increased from million in to million in this increase was due to an increase in the average sales price per ton in the capp region  which was partially offset by a decrease in tons shipped in the capp region

cost of coal sold year ended december  capp midwest corporate capp midwest corporate cost of coal sold per ton depreciation  depletion  and amortization per ton the cost of coal sold  excluding depreciation  depletion and amortization  decreased from million in to million in due to less tons sold 
our cost per ton of coal sold in the capp region increased from per ton in to per ton in this increase in cost per ton of coal sold was primarily the result of lower productivity due to increased federal and state regulatory scrutiny which caused an increase in labor costs as compared to prior year  a decrease in tons produced in response to market conditions  an increase in machine parts and repairs costs  and the impact of increased average sales prices on our sales related costs primarily royalties and severance taxes 
the major components of this increase include an increase in the company s sales related costs of per ton  labor and benefit costs of per ton  preparation and loading costs of per ton and variable mine costs of per ton 
for more detail regarding the increased regulatory activity see part ii item a risk factors underground mining is subject to increased regulation  and may require us to incur additional cost 
our cost per ton of coal sold in the midwest decreased per ton from per ton in period to per ton in the decrease in cost per ton of coal sold was due to a per ton decrease in variable costs  offset by a per ton increase in preparation plant costs 
the decrease in the variable costs was primarily due to a decrease in diesel and explosives costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased from million in to million in in the capp region  depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased million to million or per ton 
in the midwest  depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased million to million or per ton 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to higher letter of credit fees  and an increase in certain salary and benefit amounts 
the increase in the letter of credit fees is due to an increase in the usage fee under our letter of credit facility 
charges associated with repayment and amendment of debt in  we expensed million in in connection with a fee to terminate a letter of credit facility 
in  we expensed approximately million of costs associated with the various credit amendments 
additionally  we wrote off approximately million of unamortized financing charges 
income taxes our effective tax benefit rates for and were and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate is impacted primarily by the amount of the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets including our net operating loss carryforwards and percentage depletion 
for our effective tax rate was decreased by for percentage depletion 
in  our effective tax benefit rate was increased by for percentage depletion 
for our effective rate was decreased by and our effective tax benefit rate  for a change in the valuation allowance 
as of december   we had a million valuation allowance against gross deferred tax assets based on the conclusion that the net operating loss is not more likely than not to be realized 
the criteria for recording a valuation allowance are described in critical accounting estimates income taxes 
in  the effective tax rate was positively impacted by a reduction in the valuation allowance due to the generation of taxable income and the utilization of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards 
percentage depletion is an income tax deduction that is limited to a percentage of taxable income from each of our mining properties 
because percentage depletion can be deducted in excess of cost basis in the properties  it creates a permanent difference and directly impacts the effective tax rate 
fluctuations in the effective tax rate may occur due to the varying levels of profitability and thus  taxable income and percentage depletion at each of our mine locations

our cost per ton of coal sold in the midwest region increased from in to in the increase in cost per ton of coal sold was primarily due to an increase of per ton in variable costs 
the increase in the variable costs was due to increased costs for diesel fuel and explosives 
our labor and benefit costs and trucking costs also increased and per ton  respectively 
the increase in labor costs was due to an increase in wages as compared to prior year and trucking costs increased due to an increase in rates

additionally  we wrote off approximately million of unamortized financing charges 
in  we wrote off million of financing charges in connection with the repayment of the prior senior secured credit facility 
the write off of the financing charges is classified as charges associated with repayment of debt 
income taxes our effective income tax rate is impacted primarily by the amount of the valuation allowance recorded and percentage depletion

in addition  if a change of control occurs as defined in the indenture  each holder of the senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a part of the senior notes at a price equal to of their principal amount  plus any accrued interest to the date of repurchase 
convertible senior notes during the fourth quarter of  we issued million of convertible senior notes due on december  the convertible senior notes 
we recorded a discount on the convertible senior notes of million related to the portion of the proceeds that were allocated to the equity component of the convertible senior notes 
the convertible senior notes are unsecured and are convertible under certain circumstances and during certain periods at an initial conversion rate of shares of the company s common stock per  principal amount of convertible senior notes  representing an initial conversion price of approximately per share of the company s stock 
interest payments on the convertible senior notes are required semi annually 
the convertible senior notes are shown net of a million discount on the consolidated financials statements as of december  in connection with the convertible senior notes  we terminated a prior letter of credit facility and secured of the letters of credit that were outstanding under the prior letter of credit facility with approximately million in cash 
we expensed million in in connection with a fee to terminate the prior facility 
the remaining proceeds from the convertible senior notes will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
we incurred approximately million of costs in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes 
none of the convertible senior notes are currently eligible for conversion 
the convertible senior notes are convertible at the option of the holders with the length of time the convertible senior notes are convertible being dependent upon the conversion trigger upon the occurrence of any of the following events at any time from september  until december   if the closing sale price of the company s common stock for each of or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds of the conversion price of the convertible senior notes in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter  if the trading price of the convertible senior notes for each trading day during any five consecutive trading day period  as determined following a request of a holder of such convertible senior notes  was equal to or less than of the conversion value of the convertible senior notes on such trading day  or if the company elects to make certain distributions to the holders of its common stock or engage in certain corporate transactions 
revolving credit agreement in january  we amended and restated our existing revolving credit agreement as amended and restated the revolving credit agreement is referred to as the revolver 
the following is a summary of significant terms of the revolver 
maturity february interest usage rate company s option of base rate a plus or libor plus per annum maximum availability lesser of million or the borrowing base b periodic principal payments none a base rate is the higher of the federal fund rate plus  the prime rate and a libor rate plus 
b the revolver s borrowing base is based on the sum of our eligible accounts receivable plus of the eligible inventory minus reserves from time to time set by administrative agent 
the eligible accounts receivable and inventories are further adjusted as specified in the agreement 
the company s borrowing base can also be increased by of any cash collateral that the company maintains in a cash collateral account 
the revolver provides that we can use the revolver availability to issue letters of credit 
the revolver provides for a fee on any outstanding letters of credit issued under the revolver and a fee on the unused portion of the revolver 
the revolver requires certain mandatory prepayments from certain asset sales  incurrence of indebtedness and excess cash flow 
the revolver includes financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum adjusted ebitda and a maximum leverage ratio and limit capital expenditures  each as defined by the agreement 
the minimum ebitda and maximum leverage ratio are only measured if our unrestricted cash balance is less than million 
we expect to use the revolver to secure our outstanding letters of credit 
we intend to place cash in a restricted account to provide us with the maximum borrowing base under the revolver 
we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under our outstanding debt instruments as of december  we cannot assure you that we will remain in compliance in subsequent periods 
if necessary  we will consider seeking a waiver or other alternatives to remain in compliance with the covenants 
for more detail regarding the covenants under the facilities  see part ii item a risk factors we may be unable to comply with restrictions imposed by the terms of our indebtedness  which could result in a default under these instruments 
liquidity as of december   we had total liquidity of approximately million  consisting of million of borrowing capacity under our revolver and million of cash and cash equivalents 
as discussed above  in january  we increased the borrowing capacity of the revolver to million 
our intention is to use the revolver to support our existing letters of credit 
as we secure the letters of credit with our revolver  our cash that is currently being held as security for the letters of credit will become unrestricted and be available to us for use 
a portion of this cash may be used to ensure that we have adequate capacity under the revolver to support our outstanding letters of credit 
our primary source of cash is expected to be sales of coal to our utility and industrial customers 
the price of coal received can change dramatically based on market factors and will directly affect this source of cash 
our primary uses of cash include the payment of ordinary mining expenses to mine coal  capital expenditures and benefit payments 
ordinary mining expenses are driven by the cost of supplies  including steel prices and diesel fuel 
benefit payments include payments for workers compensation and black lung benefits paid over the lives of our employees as the claims are submitted 
we are required to pay these when due  and are not required to set aside cash for these payments 
we have posted surety bonds secured by letters of credit or issued letters of credit with state regulatory departments to guarantee these payments 
we believe that our revolver provides us with the ability to meet the necessary bonding requirements 
we believe that cash generated from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities and future debt and equity offerings  if any  will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments throughout and for the next several years 
nevertheless  our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and debt service obligations  or fund planned capital expenditures  will substantially depend upon our future operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal industry  debt covenants  and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
in the event that the sources of cash described above are not sufficient to meet our future cash requirements  we will need to reduce certain planned expenditures  seek additional financing  or both 
we may seek to raise funds through additional debt financing or the issuance of additional equity securities 
if such actions are not sufficient  we may need to limit our growth  sell assets or reduce or curtail some of our operations to levels consistent with the constraints imposed by our available cash flow  or any combination of these options 
our ability to seek additional debt or equity financing may be limited by our existing and any future financing arrangements  economic and financial conditions  or all three 
in particular  our convertible senior notes  senior notes and revolver restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
we cannot provide assurance that any reductions in our planned expenditures or in our expansion would be sufficient to cover shortfalls in available cash or that additional debt or equity financing would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
currently  our primary use of cash during the next several years is expected to be ordinary course of business expenses and capital expenditures for existing mines 
we currently project that our capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
our projected capital expenditures primarily consist of capital expenditure for normal mining activities including new and replacement mine equipment 
our projected capital expenditures for also include approximately million for safety mandates and million for mine development 
we expect that such expenditures will be funded through cash on hand and cash generated by operations 
net cash provided by or used in operating activities reflects net income or net loss adjusted for non cash charges and changes in net working capital including non current operating assets and liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  and net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  we had net income in of million as compared to a net loss of million in in reconciling our net income loss to cash provided by or used in operating activities  million was added for non cash charges during as compared to million during during  our net income  as adjusted for non cash charges was decreased by a million decrease in cash from our operating assets and liabilities 
the million change in our operating assets and liabilities for  includes a increase in restricted cash to secure our letters of credit  a million increase in accounts receivables  a million increase in inventories and a million decrease in accounts payable 
during  our net loss  as adjusted for non cash charges  was increased by a million increase in cash from our operating assets and liabilities 
the million change in our operating assets and liabilities for  includes a million decrease in accounts receivable  a million increase in accounts payables  a million increase in other assets and an million increase in other current liabilities 
net cash used by investing activities decreased million to million for  as compared to capital expenditures were million in and million in in  capital expenditures included million paid by the company for a mineral rights acquisition 
excluding the mineral rights acquisition  capital expenditures primarily consisted of new and replacement mine equipment and various projects to improve the production and efficiency of our mining operations 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during our primary financing activities were the receipt of of net proceeds from our convertible senior notes and million of payments on our revolving credit facility 
during our primary financing activities were the receipt of million of net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock  net borrowings of million on our revolver and the repayment million under our term loan 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt and fees under our revolver for letters of credit operating lease obligations royalty obligations purchase obligations consists of our senior notes and our convertible senior notes as of december  consists of interest payments on our senior notes and convertible senior notes 
also includes a charge associated with outstanding letter of credit fees under the revolver through the revolver s maturity assume the full amount of the revolver capacity is used for letters of credit 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on leases 
royalty obligations include minimum royalties payable on leased coal rights 
certain coal leases do not have set expiration dates but extend until completion of mining of all merchantable and mineable coal reserves 
for purposes of this table  we have generally assumed that minimum royalties on such leases will be paid for a period of ten years 
certain coal leases require payment based on minimum tonnage  for these contracts an average sales price of per ton was used to project the future commitment 
purchase obligations do not include agreements to purchase coal with vendors that do not include quantities or minimum tonnages  or monthly purchase orders 
additionally  we have liabilities relating to pension  workers compensation  black lung  and mine reclamation and closure 
as of december   the undiscounted payments related to these items are estimated to be payments due by years in thousands within year years years our determination of these noncurrent liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions  including then prevailing conditions  which may change from year to year 
in any year  if our assumptions are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
moreover  in particular for periods after  our estimates may change from the amounts included in the table  and may change significantly  if our assumptions change to reflect changing conditions 
these assumptions are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the critical accounting estimates in management s discussion and analysis 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements  including guarantees  operating leases  indemnifications  and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  and  except for the operating leases  we do not expect any material impact on our cash flow  results of operations or financial condition from these off balance sheet arrangements 
we use surety bonds to secure reclamation  workers compensation and other miscellaneous obligations 
at december   we had million of outstanding surety bonds with third parties 
these bonds were in place to secure obligations as follows post mining reclamation bonds of million  workers compensation bonds of million  wage payment  collection bonds  and other miscellaneous obligation bonds of million 
surety bond costs have increased over time and the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable 
to the extent that surety bonds become unavailable  we would seek to secure obligations with letters of credit  cash deposits  or other suitable forms of collateral 
we also use bank letters of credit to secure our obligations for workers compensation programs  various insurance contracts and other obligations 
as of december   we had million of letters of credit outstanding 
the letters of credit were secured by million of cash 
critical accounting estimates overview our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
us gaap require estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts for assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the estimates and judgments we make in connection with our consolidated financial statements are based on historical experience and various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements lists and describes our significant accounting policies 
the following critical accounting policies have a material effect on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
workers compensation we are liable under various state statutes for providing workers compensation benefits 
except as indicated  we are self insured for workers compensation at our kentucky operations  with specific excess insurance purchased from independent insurance carriers to cover individual traumatic claims in excess of the self insured limits 
for the period june to june  workers compensation coverage was insured through a third party insurance company using a large risk rating plan 
our operations in indiana are insured through a third party insurance company using a large risk rating plan 
we accrue for the present value of certain workers compensation obligations as calculated annually by an independent actuary based upon assumptions for work related injury and illness rates  discount rates and future trends for medical care costs 
the discount rate is based on interest rates on bonds with maturities similar to the estimated future cash flows 
the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these future obligations was at december  significant changes to interest rates result in substantial volatility to our consolidated financial statements 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate from to  all other things being equal  the present value of our workers compensation obligation would increase by approximately million 
a change in the law  through either legislation or judicial action  could cause these assumptions to change 
if the estimates do not materialize as anticipated  our actual costs and cash expenditures could differ materially from that currently estimated 
our estimated workers compensation liability as of december  was million 
coal miners pneumoconiosis we are required under the federal mine safety and health act of  as amended  as well as various state statutes  to provide pneumoconiosis black lung benefits to eligible current and former employees and their dependents 
we provide for federal and state black lung claims through a self insurance program for our central appalachia operations 
for the period between june and june  all black lung liabilities were insured through a third party insurance company using a large risk rating plan 
our operations in indiana are insured through a third party insurance company using a large risk rating plan 
an independent actuary calculates the estimated pneumoconiosis liability annually based on assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs  mortality  death benefits  dependents and interest rates 
the discount rate is based on interest rates on high quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the estimated future cash flows 
the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these future obligations was at december  significant changes to interest rates result in substantial volatility to our consolidated financial statements 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate by to  all other things being equal  the present value of our black lung obligation would increase by approximately million 
a change in the law  through either legislation or judicial action  could cause these assumptions to change 
if these estimates prove inaccurate  the actual costs and cash expenditures could vary materially from the amount currently estimated 
our estimated pneumoconiosis liability as of december  was million 
defined benefit pension we have in place a non contributory defined benefit pension plan under which all benefits were frozen in the estimated cost and benefits of our non contributory defined benefit pension plans are determined annually by independent actuaries  who  with our review and approval  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate and expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets 
in estimating the discount rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments with comparable maturities 
at december   the discount rate used to determine the obligation was 
significant changes to interest rates result in substantial volatility to our consolidated financial statements 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate from to  all other things being equal  the present value of our projected benefit obligation would increase by approximately million 
the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on long term historical return information and future estimates of long term investment returns for the target asset allocation of investments that comprise plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to determine expense was for the period ended december  significant changes to these rates would introduce volatility to our pension expense 
our accrued pension obligation as of december  was million 
reclamation and mine closure obligation the surface mining control reclamation act of establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as many aspects of underground mining 
our asset retirement obligation liabilities consist of spending estimates related to reclaiming surface land and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws 
our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and our engineering estimates related to these requirements 
us gaap requires that asset retirement obligations be initially recorded as a liability based on fair value  which is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
our management and engineers periodically review the estimate of ultimate reclamation liability and the expected period in which reclamation work will be performed 
in estimating future cash flows  we considered the estimated current cost of reclamation and applied inflation rates and a third party profit 
the third party profit is an estimate of the approximate markup that would be charged by contractors for work performed on our behalf 
the discount rate is our estimate of our credit adjusted risk free rate 
the estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
the actual costs could be different due to several reasons  including the possibility that our estimates could be incorrect  in which case our liabilities would differ 
if we perform the reclamation work using our personnel rather than hiring a third party  as assumed under us gaap  then the costs should be lower 
if governmental regulations change  then the costs of reclamation will be impacted 
us gaap recognizes that the recorded liability could be different than the final cost of the reclamation and addresses the settlement of the liability 
when the obligation is settled  and there is a difference between the recorded liability and the amount paid to settle the obligation  a gain or loss upon settlement is included in earnings 
our asset retirement obligation as of december  was million 
contingencies we are the subject of  or a party to  various suits and pending or threatened litigation involving governmental agencies or private interests 
we have accrued the probable and reasonably estimable costs for the resolution of these claims based upon management s best estimate of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
unless otherwise noted  management does not believe that the outcome or timing of current legal or environmental matters will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our contingencies 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are also required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including the expected level of future taxable income 
we have also considered tax planning strategies in determining the deferred tax asset that will ultimately be realized 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of the amount of our valuation allowance  we record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
we have recorded a million valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets as of december  for the portion of the gross deferred tax asset that does not meet the more likely than not criteria to be realized 
in  we recorded an income tax benefit for the reduction in our valuation allowance related to the net operating loss carryforwards that will be utilized 
coal reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves 
many of these uncertainties are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data initially assembled by our staff and analyzed by marshall miller associates  inc mm a 
the reserve information has subsequently been updated by our staff 
the updates to the reserves have been calculated in the same manner  and based on similar assumptions and qualifications  as used in the mm a studies described above  but these updates to the reserve estimates have not been reviewed by mm a 
a number of sources of information were used to determine accurate recoverable reserves estimates  including all currently available data  our own operational experience and that of our consultants  historical production from similar areas with similar conditions  previously completed geological and reserve studies  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future prices and future operating costs 
reserve estimates will change from time to time to reflect  among other factors mining activities  new engineering and geological data  acquisition or divestiture of reserve holdings  and modification of mining plans or mining methods 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances could be material 
in particular  a variance in reserve estimates could have a material adverse impact on our annual expense for depreciation  depletion and amortization and on our annual calculation for potential impairment 
for a further discussion of our coal reserves  see reserves 
evaluation of goodwill and long lived assets for impairment goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to periodic assessments of impairment 
impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level 
we test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter  or when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
long lived asset groups are tested for recoverability when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues and expenses  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the estimates used to determine whether impairment has occurred to goodwill and long lived assets are subject to a number of management assumptions 
we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit or asset group based on market prices ie  the amount for which the asset could be bought by or sold to a third party  when available 
when market prices are not available  we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit or asset group using the income approach and or the market approach  which are subject to a number of management assumptions 
the income approach uses cash flow projections 
inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  approved operating budgets  expected growth rates and cost of capital 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions  interest rates  and other market data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of fair value of an asset group  and therefore could affect the amount of potential impairment of the asset 
the following assumptions are key to our income approach we make assumptions about coal production  sales price for unpriced coal  cost to mine the coal and estimated residual value of property  plant and equipment 
these assumptions are key inputs for developing our cash flow projections 
these projections are derived using our internal operating budget and are developed on a mine by mine basis 
these projections are updated annually and reviewed by the board of directors 
historically  the company s primary variances between its projections and actual results have been with regard to assumptions for future coal production  sales prices of coal and costs to mine the coal 
these factors are based on our best knowledge at the time we prepare our budgets but can vary significantly due to regulatory issues  unforeseen mining conditions  change in commodity prices  availability and costs of labor and changes in supply and demand 
while we make our best estimates at the time we prepare our budgets it is reasonably likely that these estimates will change in future budgets  due to the changing nature of the coal environment  economic projections assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect the assumptions used in our impairment tests 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  supply and demand for coal  inflation  interest rates  and prices of raw materials commodities  and discount rate when measuring a possible impairment  future cash flows are discounted at a rate that we believe represents our cost of capital

other supplemental information reconciliation of non gaap measures ebitda is a measure used by management to measure operating performance 
we define ebitda as net income or loss plus interest expense net  income tax expense benefit and depreciation  depletion and amortization ebitda  to better measure our operating performance 
we regularly use ebitda to evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and or tax rates 
in addition  we use ebitda in evaluating acquisition targets 
adjusted ebitda and the leverage ratio are the amounts used in our current debt covenants 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted for certain cash and non cash charges and the leverage ratio limits are debt to a multiple of adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda and the leverage ratio are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain payments 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  and the leverage ratio are not recognized terms under us gaap and are not an alternative to net income  operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with us gaap or an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of operating liquidity 
because not all companies use identical calculations  this presentation of ebitda  adjusted ebitda and the leverage ratio may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
additionally  ebitda or adjusted ebitda are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management s discretionary use  as they do not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax payments  interest payments and other contractual obligations 
the leverage ratio is calculated as the company s senior funded indebtedness divided by annualized adjusted ebitda as calculated below 
the senior funded indebtedness includes the amounts outstanding under our revolver and the amount of letters of credits issued under our revolver 
as of december   we had no senior funded indebtedness outstanding

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our million senior notes and million convertible senior notes have a fixed interest rate and are not sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
our revolver has floating interest rates based on our option of either the base rate or libor rate 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolver 
we currently do not use interest rate swaps to manage this risk 
a basis point increase in the average interest rate for our floating rate borrowings would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million for each million of borrowings under the revolver 
we manage our commodity price risk through the use of long term coal supply agreements  which we define as contracts with a term of one year or more  rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
the percentage of our sales pursuant to long term contracts was approximately for the year ended december  all of our transactions are denominated in us dollars  and  as a result  we do not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks 
we are not engaged in any foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price hedging transactions and we have no trading market risk
