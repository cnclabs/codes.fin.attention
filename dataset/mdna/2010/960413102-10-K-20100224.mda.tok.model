item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a vertically integrated manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals  polymers and fabricated products 
our two principal business segments are olefins and vinyls 
we use the majority of our internally produced basic chemicals to produce higher value added chemicals and fabricated products 
consumption of the basic chemicals that we manufacture in the commodity portions of our olefins and vinyls processes has increased significantly over the past years 
our olefins and vinyls products are some of the most widely used chemicals in the world and are upgraded into a wide variety of higher value added chemical products used in many end markets 
petrochemicals are typically manufactured in large volume by a number of different producers using widely available technologies 
the petrochemical industry exhibits cyclical commodity characteristics  and margins are influenced by changes in the balance between supply and demand and the resulting operating rates  the level of general economic activity and the price of raw materials 
the cycle is generally characterized by periods of tight supply  leading to high operating rates and margins  followed by a decline in operating rates and margins primarily as a result of significant capacity additions 
due to the significant size of new plants  capacity additions are built in large increments and typically require several years of demand growth to be absorbed 
in and  the olefins and vinyls markets began a cyclical recovery and operating rates and margins rose as economic growth improved and excess capacity was absorbed 
these factors resulted in increased industry product margins in and in and  however  weakness in the construction markets contributed to lower demand for our vinyls products  and operating margins declined in our vinyls business 
continued weakness in the construction markets in  which resulted in reduced margins and volumes for our downstream products  as well as a precipitous decline in caustic prices driven by reduced industrial activity  have contributed to the operating losses in our vinyls segment in the demand for olefins products remained strong in largely due to balanced industry supply and demand fundamentals for polyethylene and strong export demand  but margins were lower due to increased feedstock costs 
in  olefins margins declined significantly due to a sharp drop in product demand that started in the third quarter of as customers began to anticipate lower product prices due to a weakened global economy and collapsing energy prices 
this was followed by a sharp drop in product prices in the last quarter of  which resulted in continued weak demand  lower operating rates and a significant operating loss in the fourth quarter of in  a strong export market and balanced supply and demand for polyethylene in the us resulted in improving sales volumes and positive operating margins and cash flow for our olefins segment 
in addition  a cost advantage for gas based ethylene producers over naphtha based ethylene producers and lower customer inventory levels following the destocking that occurred in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of also contributed to the increased demand and margins in our olefins segment 
pvc industry operating rates have dropped from peak levels in the second half of to much lower levels in this downturn  which impacts our vinyls segment  is primarily due to weakness in the construction market which started in the third quarter of and continued through looking forward  north american pvc capacity is projected to increase over the next two years and  as a result  operating rates and margins may be negatively impacted 
olefins industry forecasts show a significant increase in worldwide ethylene and ethylene derivative capacity over the next several years  with the largest increase expected to come from the middle east and asia and  as a result  olefins operating margins may be negatively impacted 
while the economic slowdown has been challenging for our customers  we believe our customer base remains generally healthy 
as we continue to manage our business in the current environment  we have taken steps designed to address the decrease in demand and margins and its resulting impact on our operations by matching production with sales demand and continuing to operate our plants in an efficient manner 
we have also implemented cost reduction programs and cut back on discretionary capital spending to preserve cash 
the global economic downturn has been challenging on our business and depending on the performance of the economy in and beyond could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we purchase significant amounts of ethane and propane feedstock  natural gas  chlorine and salt from external suppliers for use in production of basic chemicals in the olefins and vinyls chains 
we also purchase significant amounts of electricity to supply the energy required in our production processes 
while we have agreements providing for the supply of ethane and propane feedstocks  natural gas  chlorine  salt and electricity  the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile 
factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future include shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand  capacity constraints due to construction delays  strike action or involuntary shutdowns  the general level of business and economic activity  and the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation 
significant volatility in raw material costs tends to put pressure on product margins as sales price increases could lag behind raw material cost increases 
conversely  when raw material costs decrease  customers may seek relief in the form of lower sales prices 
we currently use derivative instruments to reduce price volatility risk on feedstock commodities and lower overall costs 
normally  there is a pricing relationship between a commodity that we process and the feedstock from which it is derived 
when this pricing relationship deviates from historical norms  we have from time to time entered into derivative instruments and physical positions in an attempt to take advantage of this relationship 
our historical results have been significantly affected by our plant production capacity  our efficient use of the capacity and our ability to increase our capacity 
since our inception  we have followed a disciplined growth strategy that focuses on plant acquisitions  new plant construction and internal expansion 
we evaluate each expansion project on the basis of its ability to produce sustained returns in excess of our cost of capital and its ability to improve efficiency or reduce operating costs 
as noted above in item a  risk factors  we are subject to extensive environmental regulations  which may impose significant additional costs on our operations in the future 
further  current concern about ghg emissions and their possible effects on climate change has led to the enactment of regulations  and to proposed legislation and additional regulations  that could affect us in the form of increased cost of feedstocks and fuel  other increased costs of production and decreased demand for our products 
while we do not expect any of these enactments or proposals to have a material adverse effect on us in the near term  we cannot predict the longer term effect of any of these regulations or proposals on our future financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  as a result of excess capacity due to the weak construction market and in an effort to reduce total costs  we closed our bristol  indiana pvc pipe facility and moved the production to our other pvc pipe facilities 
asset impairments  severance and other costs recorded in related to closed pvc pipe facilities  including the bristol facility  were approximately million 
in august  we entered into a million revenue bond issuance facility the series a revenue bonds facility with the louisiana local government environmental facility and development authority the authority  a political subdivision of the state of louisiana 
the authority initially issued million of floating rate tax exempt revenue bonds due august  under the gulf opportunity zone act of the initial series a revenue bonds under the series a revenue bonds facility 
in connection with the issuance of the initial series a revenue bonds  we entered into a loan agreement with the authority under which proceeds from the bond offering were lent by the authority to us 
the initial series a revenue bonds are backed by an irrevocable million letter of credit in favor of the bank of new york mellon trust company  na  as trustee for the initial series a revenue bonds 
in march  we acquired a pvc pipe plant in janesville  wisconsin 
the plant has the capacity to produce up to million pounds of pvc pipe annually in sizes up to inches for use in a variety of applications including sewer  water  plumbing and irrigation 
we began operating the plant in april 
table of contents 
index to financial statements in august  we announced our plan to construct a new chlor alkali plant to be located at our vinyls manufacturing plant in geismar  louisiana 
at present  we are evaluating a start date for construction of this plant in light of the current economic and business conditions  and we are unable to predict when the plant may be completed 
the geismar chlor alkali unit would have the capacity to produce  ecus annually  which would bring our total ecu capacity to  per year 
this project would improve the vertical integration of our vinyls business from chlorine downstream into vcm and pvc and increase caustic soda sales 
in the first quarter of our pvc pipe plant in yucca  arizona became operational with a capacity of approximately million pounds of pvc pipe annually 
the plant produces pipe for water  sewer  irrigation and related industrial and residential markets in the western united states 
in the first quarter of  we completed the expansion of our pvc resin unit at our calvert city complex 
the expansion increased our capacity by million pounds per year  bringing our total pvc capacity to billion pounds annually 
the expansion has enhanced the integration of the vinyls product chain by consuming vcm that was previously sold on the merchant market 
we experienced several shut downs and turnarounds from to during a turnaround  production at the unit is suspended while work on the unit is performed  but sales can continue during the turnaround period from inventory on hand 
in  we completed a major turnaround for one of our ethylene units at our lake charles facility 
the unit was shut down for approximately days to complete the tie in portion of a project designed to upgrade the feedstock flexibility of the unit in order to reduce energy costs and provide for additional ethylene capacity 
the cost of the turnaround of approximately million was capitalized 
in we performed a major turnaround of our styrene plant in lake charles 
the unit was shut down for a total of days to perform a major maintenance turnaround and revamp project designed to increase energy efficiency and slightly increase capacity 
the cost of this turnaround was approximately million  which was capitalized 
during august and september  we shut down our vinyls facilities at our geismar  louisiana complex and our olefins facilities at our lake charles  louisiana complex due to hurricanes gustav and ike 
both complexes sustained minimal damage from the hurricanes  however  the energy and power shortages caused by the hurricanes affected many suppliers and  as a consequence  the lake charles facilities were shut down for approximately three weeks due to the two hurricanes  while the geismar facilities were shut down for approximately one and a half weeks due to hurricane gustav 
in addition  one of our ethylene units in lake charles was idled during december due to significant customer inventory destocking and resulting weakened demand for our products 
while that unit was down  we completed a maintenance turnaround of the unit that was originally scheduled for the first half of the unit was shut down for a total of days and was successfully restarted in march the cost of this turnaround was approximately million  which was capitalized 
in january  our calvert city  kentucky complex experienced an ice storm that caused a power failure at the facility and resulted in damage to a compressor for our ethylene unit 
the power outage caused the complex to be down for eight days and the ethylene unit compressor damage resulted in reduced production rates for all major products produced at the facility for a period of days

there is no sinking fund and no scheduled amortization of the notes prior to maturity 
the notes are subject to redemption and the holders may require us to repurchase the notes upon a change of control 
all domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee other debt of ours or of another guarantor of the senior notes in excess of million are guarantors of the notes 
the agreements governing the and the senior notes together the senior notes and the revolving credit facility each contain customary covenants and events of default 
accordingly  these agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions  among other things  provide limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness  the payment of dividends  certain investments and acquisitions and sales of assets 
the most significant of these provisions in our senior notes indenture restricts us from incurring additional debt  except specified permitted debt including borrowings under our credit facility  when our fixed charge coverage ratio is below these limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions  including  without limitation  an exception for the payment of our regular quarterly dividend of up to per share currently per share 
the senior notes indenture does not allow distributions  unless  after giving pro forma effect to the distribution  our fixed charge coverage ratio is at least and such payment  together with the aggregate amount of all other distributions after january   is less than the sum of of our consolidated net income for the period from october  to the end of the most recent quarter for which financial statements have been filed  plus of net cash proceeds received after october  as a contribution to our common equity capital or from the issuance or sale of certain securities  plus several other adjustments 
for the twelve months ended december   the fixed charge coverage ratio under the senior notes indenture was the amount allowed under this restriction was million at december  the revolving credit facility also restricts distributions and specified acquisitions unless  after giving effect to such distribution or acquisition payment  our fixed charge coverage ratio is at least  provided that we may also make distributions and specified acquisitions when our fixed charge coverage ratio falls below but we maintain at least million to million depending on the amount of the distribution or acquisition payment of borrowing availability  including cash  under the credit facility 
for the twelve months ended december   the fixed charge coverage ratio under the revolving credit facility was no other agreements require us to maintain specified financial ratios 
in addition  the senior notes indenture and the revolving credit facility restrict our ability to create liens  to engage in certain affiliate transactions and to engage in sale leaseback transactions 
in december  we entered into a loan agreement with a public trust established for public purposes for the benefit of the parish of calcasieu  louisiana 
the public trust issued million principal amount of tax exempt waste disposal revenue bonds in order to finance our construction of waste disposal facilities for an ethylene plant 
the waste disposal revenue bonds expire in december and are subject to redemption and mandatory tender for purchase prior to maturity under certain conditions 
interest on the waste disposal revenue bonds accrues at a rate determined by a remarketing agent and is payable quarterly 
the interest rate on the waste disposal revenue bonds at december  and was and  respectively 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our normal operating needs for the foreseeable future

index to financial statements critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are important to our financial condition and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions 
we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes and believe those policies are reasonable and appropriate 
we apply those accounting policies that we believe best reflect the underlying business and economic events  consistent with gaap 
our more critical accounting policies include those related to long lived assets  accruals for long term employee benefits  inventories  accounts receivable and environmental and legal obligations 
inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates 
we periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss passes to the customer upon delivery under executed customer purchase orders or contracts 
for export contracts  the title and risk of loss passes to customers at the time specified by each contract 
provisions for discounts  rebates and returns are provided for in the same period as the related sales are recorded 
long lived assets 
key estimates related to long lived assets include useful lives  recoverability of carrying values and existence of any retirement obligations 
such estimates could be significantly modified 
the carrying values of long lived assets could be impaired by significant changes or projected changes in supply and demand fundamentals which would have a negative impact on operating rates or margins  new technological developments  new competitors with significant raw material or other cost advantages  adverse changes associated with the us and world economies  the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with governmental actions 
we periodically evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  including when negative conditions such as significant current or projected operating losses exist 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and the operational performance of our businesses 
actual impairment losses incurred could vary significantly from amounts estimated 
long lived assets assessed for impairment are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
additionally  future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that associated long lived assets of our businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the estimated useful lives of long lived assets range from three to years 
depreciation and amortization of these assets  including amortization of deferred turnaround costs  under the straight line method over their estimated useful lives totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
if the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation charges would be accelerated 
we defer the costs of major turnaround maintenance and repair activities and amortize the costs over the period until the next expected major turnaround of the affected unit 
in  we completed a major maintenance turnaround at one of our ethylene units in lake charles 
in  we completed a major turnaround at our styrene facility in lake charles 
in  we had a major turnaround at one of our ethylene units at our lake charles facility 
total costs deferred on these turnarounds were million in  million in and million in amortization in  and of previously deferred turnaround costs was million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   capitalized turnaround costs  net of

index to financial statements accumulated amortization  totaled million 
expensing turnaround costs would likely result in greater variability of our quarterly operating results and would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
additional information concerning long lived assets and related depreciation and amortization appears in notes and to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
fair value estimates 
we develop estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase prices paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in those acquisitions  to assess impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets and to record derivative instruments 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations  including the engagement of third party consultants 
at december   our recorded goodwill was million  all of which was associated with the acquisition of our longview facilities 
in addition  we record all derivative instruments at fair value 
the fair value of these items is determined by quoted market prices or from observable market based inputs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
long term employee benefit costs 
our costs for long term employee benefits  particularly pension and postretirement medical and life benefits  are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties  and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is our responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that represent the best estimates of those uncertainties 
it is also our responsibility to review those assumptions periodically and  if necessary  adjust the assumptions to reflect changes in economic or other factors 
accounting for employee retirement plans involves estimating the cost of benefits that are to be provided in the future and attempting to match  for each employee  that estimated cost to the period worked 
to accomplish this  we rely extensively on advice from actuaries  and assumptions are made about inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover and discount rates that ultimately impact amounts recorded 
changes in these assumptions may result in different expense and liability amounts 
two of the more significant assumptions relate to the discount rate for measuring benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
at december   the projected benefit obligation was calculated using an assumed weighted average discount rate of 
the discount rate was determined using a benchmark pension discount curve and applying spot rates from the curve to each year of expected benefit payments to determine the appropriate discount rate for the company 
as a result of the turmoil in the financial markets  we lowered our long term return on plan assets assumption from in to in  resulting in an increase of pension expense of million 
in addition  the funding requirements for the pension plans are expected to increase in even with the increase in the value of plan assets that occurred during additional information on the funding requirements and key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appear in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
assumed healthcare trend rates do not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans because benefits for participants are capped at a fixed amount 
while we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k related to these retirement plans are based on the best estimates and judgments available  the actual outcomes could differ from these estimates 
inventories 
inventories primarily include product  materials and supplies 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
the use of other methods  such as last in  first out lifo  could result in differing amounts being reported as inventories and cost of sales depending on price changes and sales turnover levels 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in our determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts  and consistent with our accounting policy  we estimate the amount of accounts receivable that we believe are unlikely to be collected and we record an expense of that amount 
estimating this amount requires us to analyze the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements financial strength of our customers  and  in our analysis  we combine the use of historical experience  our accounts receivable aged trial balance and specific collectibility analysis 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
balances over days past due and accounts determined by our analysis of financial strength of customers to be high risk are reviewed individually for collectibility 
by its nature  such an estimate is highly subjective and it is possible that the amount of accounts receivable that we are unable to collect may be different than the amount initially estimated 
income taxes 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded based upon temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes 
deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period 
valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
environmental and legal obligations 
we consult with various professionals to assist us in making estimates relating to environmental costs and legal proceedings 
we accrue an expense when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
while we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to these contingencies are based on the best estimates and judgments available  the actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 
additional information about certain legal proceedings and environmental matters appears in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change 
accordingly  product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle 
we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies 
our strategies include ethylene product feedstock flexibility and moving downstream into the olefins and vinyls products where pricing is more stable 
we use derivative instruments in certain instances to reduce price volatility risk on feedstocks and products 
based on our open derivative positions at december   a hypothetical increase in the price of a gallon of ethane would have increased our income before taxes by million and a hypothetical increase in the price of a mmbtu of natural gas would have decreased our income before taxes by million 
additional information concerning derivative commodity instruments appears in note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to fixed and variable rate debt 
at december   we had variable rate debt of million outstanding 
all of the debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility none was outstanding at december  and our loans relating to the initial series a revenue bonds and to the tax exempt waste disposal revenue bonds are at variable rates 
we do not currently hedge our variable interest rate debt  but we may do so in the future 
the average variable interest rate for our variable rate debt of million as of december  was 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the average interest rate on our variable rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
also  at december   we had million principal amount of fixed rate debt 
we are subject to the risk of higher interest cost if and when this debt is refinanced 
if interest rates are higher at the time of refinancing  our annual interest expense would increase by approximately million
