item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an integrated biopharmaceutical company that applies our comprehensive precision targeted immunotherapy platform to generate a pipeline of candidates to treat cancer and other difficult to treat diseases 
our immunotherapy platform includes a complementary portfolio of monoclonal antibodies  antibody targeted vaccines  antibody drug conjugates and immunomodulators to create novel disease specific drug candidates 
our strategy is to develop and demonstrate proof of concept for our product candidates before leveraging their value through partnerships or  in appropriate situations  continuing late stage development through commercialization ourselves 
demonstrating proof of concept for a product candidate generally involves bringing it through phase clinical trials and one or more phase clinical trials so that we are able to demonstrate  based on human trials  good safety data for the product candidate and some data indicating its effectiveness 
we thus leverage the value of our technology portfolio through corporate  governmental and non governmental partnerships 
this approach allows us to maximize the overall value of our technology and product portfolio while best ensuring the expeditious development of each individual product 
our current collaborations include the commercialization of an oral human rotavirus vaccine and the development of oncology and infectious disease vaccines 
our product candidates address large market opportunities for which we believe current therapies are inadequate or non existent 
acquisition of curagen in connection with the curagen merger  effective october   we i issued  shares of our common stock  or shares  in exchange for each share of outstanding curagen common stock  plus cash in lieu of fractional shares the curagen exchange ratio  ii assumed all of the curagen stock options and iii assumed the curagen debt 
we acquired curagen to gain access to a pipeline of oncology focused antibodies  including cdx formerly cr currently in phase clinical development for the treatment of breast and melanoma cancer  and cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
the transaction is being accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting 
all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction are recognized at their acquisition date fair values  while transaction costs associated with the transaction are expensed as incurred 
purchase price the purchase price for curagen is based on the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred  which was calculated based on the closing price of our common stock of per share on october  the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred consisted of the following in thousands fair value of common stock issued fair value of curagen stock options total consideration transferred us gaap requires that the fair value of replacement awards attributable to precombination service be included in the consideration transferred 
of the curagen stock options assumed  all but  were immediately vested upon closing in accordance with the terms of the stock option agreements 
table of contents and employment agreements 
the fair value of the curagen stock options that has been attributed to precombination service is included in the consideration transferred 
allocations of assets and liabilities we have allocated the consideration transferred for curagen to net tangible assets  intangible assets  goodwill and a severance obligation 
the difference between the aggregate consideration transferred and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill 
this goodwill relates to the potential synergies from the curagen merger and a deferred tax liability related to acquired ipr d intangible assets 
none of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes 
the following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date in thousands cash and cash equivalents marketable securities identifiable intangible assets ipr d amgen amendment topotarget agreement other current and long term assets goodwill curagen debt deferred tax liabilities  net other assumed liabilities total the purchase price allocation has been prepared on a preliminary basis and is subject to change as additional information becomes available concerning the fair value and tax basis of the acquired assets and liabilities 
any adjustments to the purchase price allocation will be made as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the acquisition date 
the estimated fair value attributed to ipr d intangible assets represents an estimate of the fair value of purchased in process technology for curagen s research programs that  as of october   had not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
only those research programs that had advanced to a stage of development where we believed reasonable net future cash flow forecasts could be prepared and a reasonable likelihood of technical success existed were included in the estimated fair value 
accordingly  the ipr d programs primarily represent the estimated fair value of cdx the estimated fair value of the ipr d programs was determined based on estimates of expected future net cash flows 
these expected future net cash flows included estimates for revenue and associated costs for the ipr d programs based on i relevant industry factors  ii current and expected trends in the product development life cycle  iii the ability to engage a strategic partner  iv the ability to obtain regulatory approval  and v the ability to manufacture and commercialize the products 
the probability adjusted future net cash flows which reflect the different stages of development of each program are then present valued utilizing an estimate of the appropriate discount rate which is consistent with the uncertainties of the cash flows utilized 
finally  the expected future net cash flows were calculated assuming the amgen amendment defined below was not entered into because the fair value attributable to the amgen amendment is separated from the fair value of the ipr d programs 
the expected future net cash flows for cdx were based on the expectation that a bla for cdx will be filed with the fda by the end of we expect the commercial launch as promptly as commercially practicable after necessary regulatory approvals are received 
assuming a traditional 
table of contents timeline for the regulatory review process  we expect cdx will be commercially launched in these assumptions require various levels of in house and external testing  clinical trials and approvals from the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities before cdx could be commercialized in the us or other territories 
drug development involves a high degree of risk and most products that make it into clinical development do not receive marketing approval 
numerous risks and uncertainties can delay or stop clinical development of a pharmaceutical product prior to the receipt of marketing approval  including  but not limited to  results from clinical trials that do not support continuing development  issues related to manufacturing or intellectual property protection  and other events or circumstances that cause unanticipated delays  technical problems or other difficulties 
given these risks and uncertainties  there can be no assurance that the development of cdx will be successfully completed 
if the development of cdx is not successful  in whole or in part  or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the expected financial benefits from the development of cdx or the transaction as a whole 
the estimated fair value attributed to the may amendment to the curagen and amgen fremont successor in interest to abgenix license agreement relates to curagen s exclusive rights to develop and commercialize cdx and other licensed antigens amgen amendment 
under the amgen amendment  curagen and amgen fremont agreed to modify the terms of their existing cross license of antigens whereby the amended license would be fully paid up and royalty free except for any potentially required payments by curagen to the original licensor of cdx 
the estimated fair value of the amgen amendment was based on the increase in expected future net cash flows for the ipr d programs related to cdx after the amgen amendment was entered into as compared to the expected future net cash flows if the amgen amendment was not entered into 
the estimated fair value attributed to the amgen amendment is being amortized through the date of the last expiring patent covering cdx the estimated fair value attributed to topotarget agreement between curagen and topotarget relates to curagen s rights under the topotarget agreement to receive up to million in either potential commercial milestone payments related to future net sales of belinostat or of any sublicense income received by topotarget topotarget payments 
the estimated fair value of the topotarget agreement was based on estimates of the probability adjusted expected future net cash flows of the topotarget payments 
the estimated fair value attributed to the topotarget agrement is being amortized through the date of the estimated receipt of the last payment under the topotarget payments 
in february  topotarget entered into a co development and commercialization agreement for belinostat with spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc resulting in our receipt of million of the topotarget payments 
the deferred tax liability  net of million primarily relates to the temporary differences associated with the ipr d intangible assets  which are not deductible for tax purposes 
current programs and partnerships our products are derived from a broad set of complementary technologies which have the ability to utilize the human immune system and enable the creation of preventative and therapeutic agents 
we are using these technologies to develop vaccines and targeted immunotherapeutics that prevent or treat cancer and disease caused by infectious organisms  and treatment vaccines that modify undesirable activity by the body s own proteins or cells 
a number of our immunotherapeutic and vaccine product candidates are in various stages of clinical trials 
we expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses will be incurred in support of our current and future clinical trial programs 

table of contents the following table includes the programs that we currently believe are material to our business product generic indication field partner status clinical cdx rindopepimut glioblastoma multiforme pfizer pf phase b cdx glembatumumab vedotin metastatic melanoma and breast cancer phase cdx colorectal  bladder  pancreas  ovarian and breast tumors phase cdx multiple solid tumors phase cdx renal disease phase preclinical cdx cancer  autoimmune disease and transplant preclinical cdx immuno modulation  multiple tumors preclinical cdx renal and ovarian cancer preclinical cdx renal disease preclinical marketed products rotarix rotavirus infection glaxosmithkline marketed the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
it is not unusual for the clinical development of these types of product candidates to each take five years or more  and for total development costs to exceed million for each product candidate 
our estimates that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase years phase years phase years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate 
we test potential product candidates in numerous preclinical studies for safety  toxicology and immunogenicity 
we may then conduct multiple clinical trials for each product candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain product candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates 

table of contents an element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a broad portfolio of product candidates 
this is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures 
as a result  we believe our future capital requirements and our future financial success are not substantially dependent on any one product candidate 
to the extent we are unable to maintain a broad range of product candidates  our dependence on the success of one or a few product candidates increases 
regulatory approval is required before we can market our product candidates as therapeutic or vaccine products 
in order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval  the regulatory agency must conclude that our clinical data is safe and effective 
historically  the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials through phase have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
a number of new drugs  biologics and vaccines have shown promising results in early clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
furthermore  our business strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
in the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one of our product candidates  the estimated completion date would largely be under control of that third party rather than us 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements  in whole or in part  and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements 
our programs may also benefit from subsidies  grants  contracts or government or agency sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  we are unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when  if ever  and to what extent it will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
during the past five years through december   we incurred an aggregate of million in research and development expenses 
the following table indicates the amount incurred for each of our significant research programs and for other identified research and development activities during the years ended december  and the amounts disclosed in the following table reflect direct research and development costs  license fees associated with the underlying technology and an allocation of indirect research and development costs to each program 
prior to  the privately held 
table of contents celldex research did not maintain records that allowed for quantification of research and development expenses by project 
year ended december  year ended december  in thousands clinical cdx cdx cdx cdx cdx preclinical cdx cdx cdx cdx other bacterial vaccines choleragarde etec ty cdx other programs total r d expense clinical development programs cdx our lead clinical development program  cdx  is a peptide based immunotherapy that targets the tumor specific molecule called egfrviii  a functional variant of the naturally expressed epidermal growth factor receptor egfr  a protein which has been well validated as a target for cancer therapy 
unlike egfr  egfrviii is not present in normal tissues  and has been shown to be a transforming oncogene that can directly contribute to the cancer cell growth 
egfrviii is commonly present in glioblastoma multiforme  or gbm  the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer  and has also been observed in various other cancers such as breast  ovarian  prostate  colorectal  and head neck cancer 
in april  we and pfizer inc pfizer entered into a license and development agreement the pfizer agreement under which pfizer was granted an exclusive worldwide license to cdx the pfizer agreement also gives pfizer exclusive rights to the use of egfrviii vaccines in other potential indications 
pfizer funds all development costs for these programs 
we and pfizer are currently pursuing the development of cdx for gbm therapy and plan to expand the clinical development into other cancers through additional clinical studies 
the fda has granted orphan drug designation for cdx for the treatment of egfrviii expressing gbm as well as fast track designation 
initial clinical development of egfrviii immunotherapy was led by collaborating investigators at the brain center at duke comprehensive cancer center in durham  north carolina and at md anderson cancer center in houston  texas 
the results from the phase victori and phase a activate studies  which enrolled and patients  respectively  have demonstrated a significant increase in the time to disease progression greater than in the patients who were vaccinated  and also in overall survival rates greater than  both relative to appropriately matched historical controls 
an extension of the phase a program act ii at the same two institutions has enrolled 
table of contents additional gbm patients treated in combination with temozolomide the current standard of care 
preliminary results from this study act ii currently estimates median overall survival to be months  although the median has not yet been reached  while the survival of a matched historical control group was months with a p value 
overall time to progression in the act ii study was months compared with months for the historical control group 
we initiated a phase b randomized study act iii of cdx combined with standard of care  temozolomide  versus standard of care alone in patients with gbm in over sites throughout the united states 
in december  we announced an amendment to convert the act iii study to a single arm phase clinical trial in which all patients will receive cdx in combination with temozolomide 
the decision  which followed the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee  was based on the observation that the majority of patients randomized to the control standard of care arm withdrew from this open label study after being randomized to the control arm 
patients participating on the control arm of the study were offered the option to receive treatment with cdx under this amendment  the act iii study provided for a multi center  non randomized dataset for cdx in patients with newly diagnosed gbm 
these data will provide important additional information that can be used to better design the future development of cdx enrollment in act iii is complete with a total of over patients enrolled and we expect to present updated results during cdx cdx formerly cr vcmmae is an antibody drug conjugate adc that consists of a fully human monoclonal antibody  cr  linked to a potent cell killing drug  monomethyl auristatin e mmae 
the cr antibody specifically targets glycoprotein nmb or gpnmb that is expressed in a variety of human cancers including breast cancer and melanoma 
the adc technology  comprised of mmae and a stable linker system for attaching it to cr  was licensed from seattle genetics  inc the adc is designed to be stable in the bloodstream 
following intravenous administration  cdx targets and binds to gpnmb and upon internalization into the targeted cell  cdx is designed to release mmae from cr to produce a cell killing effect 
we acquired the rights to cdx in connection with the curagen merger 
treatment of breast cancer in june  an open label  multi center phase study was initiated of cdx administered intravenously once every three weeks to patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have received prior therapy median of seven prior regimens 
the study began with a bridging phase to confirm the maximum tolerated dose mtd and has expanded into a phase open label  multi center study 
the study confirmed the safety of cdx at the pre defined maximum dose level mg kg in patients 
an additional patients were enrolled as an expanded phase cohort for a total of treated patients at mg kg  the phase dose to evaluate the progression free survival pfs rate at weeks 
as previously seen in melanoma patients  the mg kg dose was well tolerated in this patient population with the most common adverse events of rash  alopecia  and fatigue 
the primary activity endpoint  which called for at least of patients in the phase study portion to be progression free at twelve weeks  has been met 
to date  of evaluable patients are without progression of disease at twelve weeks 
in addition  at the phase dose level  of evaluable patients achieved confirmed or unconfirmed partial responses pr while of evaluable patients with measurable disease experienced some reduction in tumor size 
gpnmb expression was identified in of of analyzed tumor samples and treatment with cdx was associated with improved outcomes in all activity parameters in patients whose tumors expressed gpnmb 
notably  in patients who received the phase dose and whose tumors expressed gpnmb  of had confirmed pr  of had 
table of contents decreases in tumor size  and all achieved at least stable disease with duration from to weeks 
the median pfs in all patients was weeks  but in patients whose tumors expressed gpnmb  median pfs was weeks  compared to median pfs of weeks for patients whose tumors did not express gpnmb 
in patients with triple negative disease  of analyzed samples expressed gpnmb  of evaluable patients had tumor shrinkage  and the median pfs for these patients was weeks 
we expect to initiate a randomized phase b controlled study in patients with advanced breast cancer that express gpnmb in the second half of treatment of metastatic melanoma cancer in june  a phase open label  multi center  dose escalation study was initiated to evaluate the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics of cdx for patients with un resectable stage iii or stage iv melanoma who have failed no more than one prior line of cytotoxic therapy 
during the phase portion of the study  doses of cdx between mg kg to mg kg were evaluated and generally well tolerated  with rash and neutropenia emerging at higher doses 
the mtd was determined to be mg kg administered intravenously iv once every three weeks 
in june  results were announced for the patients who were treated in the phase portion of the study 
of the patients enrolled  had stage iv disease of which two thirds were classified as mc  the poorest risk group 
the study successfully met its primary activity endpoint  with objective responses unconfirmed observed in evaluable patients  and median duration of response of months 
the median overall pfs was months 
tumor shrinkage was observed in of patients  and patients had best response of stable disease 
dermatologic adverse events consisting of rash  alopecia  and pruritus were the most common toxicities in this study 
other adverse events included fatigue  diarrhea  musculoskeletal pain  anorexia and nausea 
grade or neutropenia was observed in patients 
the absence of rash in the first cycle of treatment predicted a worse pfs 
additionally  in a subset of patients with tumor biopsies  high levels of tumor expression of gpnmb appeared to correlate with favorable outcome 
enrollment has been completed in the phase portion of the melanoma trial to evaluate more frequent dosing schedules of cdx  including a weekly and a two out of every three week regimen  to explore if more frequent administration can provide additional activity in patients with metastatic melanoma 
a dose of mg kg given once every week has been identified as the mtd in a weekly schedule  and a dose of mg kg was being explored in the two out of three week schedule 
although median duration of follow up was only weeks  objective responses have thus far been observed in of evaluable patients treated with weekly cdx confirmed and confirmed response in evaluable patients treated with cdx two out of every three weeks 
we expect to present updated results during the first half of cdx our lead apc targeting technology product candidate  cdx  is in development for the treatment of epithelial tumors such as colorectal  pancreatic  bladder  ovarian and breast cancers 
cdx targets the beta chain of human chorionic gonadotropin  known as hcg beta  which is an antigen often found in epithelial tumors 
the presence of hcg beta in these cancers correlates with a poor clinical outcome  suggesting that this molecule may contribute to tumor growth 
normal adult tissues have minimal expression of hcg beta  therefore  targeted immune responses are not expected to generate significant side effects 
enrollment is complete in our two phase studies at multiple centers designed to explore safety and dose effect relationships via two administration routes intradermal id  a traditional vaccine route that allows efficient access to local dermal dendritic cells and intravenous iv  a novel systemic approach to vaccination that might target a much larger population of dendritic cells 
the phase 
table of contents studies investigated the safety and immunogenicity of cdx alone and in combination with adjuvants  including gm csf known to increase mannose receptor expression on dendritic cells and toll like receptor tlr agonists poly iclc or hiltonol and r or resiquimod 
patients with an assortment of different tumor types that are known to express hcg beta were enrolled with retrospective analysis for hcg beta expression 
an escalating four dose regimen was utilized with the possibility of retreatment if patients demonstrate tumor regression or stable disease 
the phase studies enrolled over patients with heavily pretreated  advanced stage breast  colon  bladder and pancreatic cancer  with an average of prior therapies across the treatment population 
all patient cohorts demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no dose limiting toxicity to date 
the combination of cdx with tlr agonists significantly enhanced immune responses against hcg beta  providing strong humoral responses in of patients and cellular immune responses in of patients analyzed to date 
immune responses occurred even in the presence of high circulating levels of hcg beta  suggesting that the cdx can overcome antigen tolerance in advanced and heavily pretreated cancers 
nine patients in the studies experienced disease stabilization from months to months following the initiation of cdx vaccination 
two of these patients have received multiple courses of cdx and continue treatment with stable disease at and months 
these data provide the basis for advancing cdx into a front line patient population selected for hcg beta expressing cancers 
we expect to initiate a randomized phase b controlled study in patients with newly diagnosed invasive bladder cancer in the second quarter of patient s whose bladder cancer expresses hcg beta are predicted to have more aggressive disease and shorter survival 
in this study we plan to select only patients with confirmed hcg beta expression using a specific diagnostic assay 
cdx cdx is a fusion protein consisting of a fully human monoclonal antibody with specificity for the dendritic cell receptor  dec  linked to the ny eso tumor antigen 
in humans  ny eso is one of the most immunogenic tumor antigens and has been detected in of cancers  thus representing a broad opportunity 
this product is intended to selectively deliver the ny eso antigen to apcs for generating robust immune responses against cancer cells expressing ny eso unlike cdx  which targets the mannose receptor expressing dendritic cells  cdx is the first apc product targeting dec expressing dendritic cells 
we are developing cdx for the treatment of malignant melanoma and a variety of solid tumors which express the proprietary cancer antigen ny eso  which we licensed from the ludwig institute for cancer research in we believe that preclinical studies have shown that cdx is effective for activation of human t cell responses against ny eso in september  we initiated enrollment in a dose escalating phase clinical trial aimed at determining the optimal dose for further development based on the safety  tolerability  and immunogenicity of the cdx vaccine 
the trial will evaluate three different doses of the vaccine in combination with resiquimod  an activator of tlr and we expect to enroll approximately patients with solid tumor cancers at multiple clinical sites in the united states 
cdx cdx is a molecule that inhibits a part of the immune system called the complement system 
the complement system is a series of proteins that are important initiators of the body s acute inflammatory response against disease  infection and injury 
excessive complement activation also plays a role in some persistent inflammatory conditions 
cdx is a soluble form of naturally occurring complement receptor that inhibits the activation of the complement cascade in animal models and in human clinical trials 
we believe that regulating the complement system could have therapeutic and 
table of contents prophylactic applications in several acute and chronic conditions  including organ transplantation  multiple sclerosis  rheumatoid arthritis  age related macular degeneration amd  atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome ahus  paroxysmal nocturnal hemaglobinuria pnh  dense deposit disease ddd in kidneys  and myasthenia gravis 
we are currently defining the most appropriate clinical development path for cdx and are focusing on rare disease conditions of unregulated complement activation as the fastest route to fda approval 
preclinical development programs cdx cdx is a fms like tyrosine kinase ligand fltl that we licensed from amgen in march cdx is a growth factor for stem cells and immune cells called dendritic cells 
based on previous experience with this molecule  we believe that cdx has considerable opportunity in various transplant settings as a stem cell mobilizing agent 
in addition  cdx is an immune modulating molecule that increases the numbers and activity of specific types of immune cells 
we believe cdx has significant opportunity for synergistic development in combination with proprietary molecules in our portfolio 
we expect to file an ind application for cdx before the end of cdx we have entered into a license agreement with the university of southampton  uk  to develop human antibodies to cd  a potentially important target for immunotherapy of various cancers 
in preclinical models  antibodies to cd alone have been shown to mediate anti tumor effects  and may be particularly effective in combination with other immunotherapies 
cd is a critical molecule in the activation pathway of lymphocytes 
it is downstream from cd  and may provide a novel way to regulate the immune responses 
engaging cd with the appropriate monoclonal antibody has proven highly effective at promoting anti cancer immunity in mouse models 
we are evaluating new human monoclonal antibodies in preclinical models 
cdx cdx formerly cr vcmmae is a fully human monoclonal adc that targets tim  an immunomudulatory protein that appears to down regulate immune response to tumors 
the antibody  cdx  is linked to a potent chemotherapeutic  monomethyl auristatin e mmae  using seattle genetics proprietary technology 
the adc is designed to be stable in the bloodstream  but to release mmae upon internalization into tim expressing tumor cells  resulting in a targeted cell killing effect 
cdx has shown potent activity in preclinical models of ovarian and renal cancer 
we acquired the rights to cdx in connection with the curagen merger 
cdx we are developing therapeutic human antibodies to a signaling molecule known as cd or fca receptor type i fcari 
cd is expressed by some white blood cells and leukemic cell lines  and has been shown to be important in controlling inflammation and tumor growth in animal models 
we have proprietary  fully human antibodies to cd in preclinical development 
depending upon the specific antibody used  anti cd antibodies can either be activating and thus stimulate immune responses  or down regulating and act as an anti inflammatory agent 

table of contents marketed products rotavirus vaccine rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhea and vomiting in infants and children 
in  we licensed our oral rotavirus strain to glaxo and glaxo assumed responsibility for all subsequent clinical trials and all other development activities 
glaxo gained approval for its rotavirus vaccine  rotarix  in mexico in july  which represented the first in a series of worldwide approvals and commercial launches for the product leading up to the approval in europe in and in the us in we licensed in our rotavirus strain in and owe a license fee of to cincinnati children s hospital medical center cch on net royalties received from glaxo 
we are obligated to maintain a license with cch with respect to the glaxo agreement 
the term of the glaxo agreement is through the expiration of the last of the relevant patents covered by the agreement  although glaxo may terminate the agreement upon days prior written notice 
in may  we entered into an agreement whereby an affiliate of prf purchased an interest in the milestone payments and net royalties that we will receive on the development and worldwide sales of rotarix 
we have received a total of million in milestone payments under the prf agreement 
no additional milestone payments are due from prf under the agreement 
royalty rates on rotarix escalate from to based on net product sales in countries that have valid patent protection 
these royalty rates are discounted by for non patent countries primarily international markets 
in september  we received notice from glaxo that glaxo would begin paying royalties on sales of rotarix vaccine at the lower of the two royalty rates under their license agreement 
glaxo s decision to pay the lower royalty rate which is of the full rate is based upon glaxo s assertion that rotarix is not covered by the patents glaxo licensed from us in australia and certain european countries 
we are currently evaluating the basis for glaxo s action and our potential remedies 
if glaxo s position stands  the royalties to which prf is entitled will no longer be limited by a million annual threshold  which we projected may have been reached in later years as sales of rotarix increased 
irrespective of glaxo s position  we will still retain approximately of the royalties on worldwide sales of rotarix once prf receives times the aggregate cash payments of million it made to us  though the potential amount of such residual royalties will be lower if glaxo s position stands 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include accounting for business combinations  revenue recognition  property and equipment  impairment of long lived assets  marketable securities  research and development expenses and stock based compensation expense 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could materially change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us in that they are important to the portrayal of 
table of contents our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements business combinations we account for business combinations that were completed after january  or will be completed in the future  including the curagen merger  under the acquisition method of accounting 
we assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we assess the fair value of assets  including intangible assets such as ipr d  using a variety of methods including present value models 
each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant 
the method used to estimate the fair values of ipr d assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset  including a market participant s assumptions regarding the probability of completing ipr d projects  which would require obtaining regulatory approval for marketing of the associated drug candidate  a market participant s estimates regarding the timing of and the expected costs to complete ipr d projects  a market participant s estimates of future cash flows from potential product sales  and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant 
transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with the transaction are expensed as incurred 
ipr d assets acquired in a business combination initially are recorded at fair value and accounted for as indefinite lived intangible assets 
these assets are maintained on our consolidated balance sheets until either the project underlying them is completed or the assets become impaired 
if a project is completed  the carrying value of the related intangible asset is amortized over the remaining estimated life of the asset beginning in the period in which the project is completed 
if a project becomes impaired or is abandoned  the carrying value of the related intangible asset is written down to its fair value and an impairment charge is taken in the period in which the impairment occurs 
ipr d assets will be tested for impairment on an annual basis during the third quarter  or earlier if impairment indicators are present 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination with a finite life are recorded at fair value and amortized over the greater of economic consumption or on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination is allocated to goodwill 
goodwill will be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis during the third quarter  or earlier if impairment indicators are present 
for acquisitions completed prior to january   including the avant merger  we expensed the fair value of ipr d to research and development expense as of the acquisition date and included transaction costs associated with the business combination as part of the cost of the acquired company 
revenue recognition we account for revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables as separate units of accounting if i the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  ii there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and iii if the right of return exists  delivery of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
if these criteria are not met  the revenue elements are considered a single unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
we have entered into various license and development agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and 
table of contents royalties on net product sales 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payments  provided that i a contractual arrangement exists  ii the contract price is fixed or determinable  iii the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and iv we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
upfront non refundable fees associated with license and development agreements where we have continuing performance obligations under the terms of the agreement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the estimated service period as we complete our obligations 
where our level of effort is relatively constant over the performance period or no other pattern is estimable  the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments due or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the straight line basis  as of the period ending date 
if the estimated service period is subsequently modified  the period over which the upfront fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis 
the determination of the performance period involves judgment on management s part 
funding of research and development is recognized as revenue over the term of the applicable contract as costs are incurred related to that contract

laboratory equipment and office furniture and equipment are depreciated over five years and computer equipment is depreciated over three years 
manufacturing equipment is amortized over seven to ten years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the non cancelable term of the related lease  including any renewals that are reasonably assured of occurring 
property and equipment under construction is classified as construction in progress and is depreciated or amortized only after the asset is placed in service 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense whereas the costs of significant improvements which extend the life of the underlying asset are capitalized

liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
our working capital at december  was million 
at december   we had convertible subordinated debt due in february of million 
we incurred a loss of million for the year ended december  net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million 
we believe that the cash inflows from existing grants and collaborations  interest income on invested funds and our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  are sufficient to meet estimated working capital requirements and fund planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
our cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase and consist primarily of investments in money market mutual funds with commercial banks and financial institutions 
we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits 
we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances 
we invest our excess cash balances in marketable securities including municipal bond securities  us government agency securities  and high grade corporate bonds that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
our investment policy seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity 

table of contents the use of our cash flows for operations has primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our offices  laboratories and manufacturing facility  fees paid in connection with preclinical studies  clinical studies  contract manufacturing  laboratory supplies and services  consulting  legal and other professional fees 
to date  and for the foreseeable future  the primary sources of cash flows from operations have been payments received from our collaborative partners and from government entities 
the timing of any new collaboration agreements  government contracts or grants and any payments under these agreements  contracts or grants cannot be easily predicted and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
during the next twelve to twenty four months  we may take further steps to raise additional capital to meet our long term liquidity needs including  but not limited to  the licensing of technology programs with existing or new collaborative partners  possible business combinations  or the issuance of common stock or other securities via private placements or public offerings 
while we may continue to seek capital through a number of means  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  particularly in light of the recent disruptions in the financial markets and our negotiating position in capital raising efforts may worsen as existing resources are used 
there is also no assurance that we will be able to enter into further collaborative relationships 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders  debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate as a business  and licensing or strategic collaborations may result in royalties or other terms which reduce our economic potential from products under development 
if we are unable to raise the funds necessary to meet our long term liquidity needs  we may have to delay or discontinue the development of programs  license out programs earlier than expected  raise funds at significant discount or on other unfavorable terms  or sell all or part of us 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to pfizer s up front payment of million received during the year ended december  we expect that cash used in operations will continue to increase in primarily related to the continued development of our therapeutic product pipeline  including bringing forward new product candidates into clinical development 
we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in the area of research and development  including preclinical and clinical trials  as our product candidates are developed

as our product candidates progress through the clinical trial process  we may be obligated to make significant milestone payments 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the million in cash acquired in the curagen merger in offset by higher purchases of marketable securities in and the cash acquired in the avant merger in we expect to incur future facility cost as a result of continued capital expansion  renovation and replacements 
our investment in capital equipment is discretionary and there may be significant fluctuations on a quarterly basis

we are also eligible to receive potential milestone payments exceeding million for the successful development and commercialization of cdx and additional egfrviii vaccine products  as well as royalties on any product sales 
aggregate contractual obligations we have entered into licensing agreements with several universities  research organizations and other corporations 
under the terms of these agreements  we have received licenses or options to license technology  specified patents or patent applications 
our licensing and development collaboration agreements generally provide for royalty payments equal to specified percentages of product sales  annual license maintenance fees and continuing patent prosecution costs 
in addition  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties of up to approximately million as part of our various collaborations including licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones had not occurred as of december   such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements 
we expect to incur approximately million of milestone payments in the following table summarizes our contractual obligations not including contingent royalty and milestone payments as described above at december  and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future years
