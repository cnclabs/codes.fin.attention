item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ducommun incorporated ducommun or the company  through its subsidiaries designs  engineers and manufactures aerostructure and electromechanical components and subassemblies  and provides engineering  technical and program management services principally for the aerospace industry 
these components  assemblies and services are provided principally for domestic and foreign commercial and military aircraft  helicopter  missile and space programs 
domestic commercial aircraft programs include the boeing ng    and foreign commercial aircraft programs include the airbus industrie a and a aircraft  bombardier business and regional jets  and the embraer and major military programs include the boeing c  f and f and lockheed martin f and f aircraft  and various aircraft and shipboard electronics upgrade programs 
commercial and military helicopter programs include helicopters manufactured by boeing principally the apache and chinook helicopters  united technologies  bell  augusta and carson 
the company also supports various unmanned space launch vehicle and satellite programs 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a non cash charge of  at dti relating to its miltec reporting unit for the impairment of goodwill 
in accordance with asc goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performed its required annual impairment test for goodwill using a discounted cash flow analysis supported by comparative market multiples to determine the fair values of its businesses versus their book values 
the test as of december  indicated the book value of miltec exceeded the fair value of the business 
the impairment charge was primarily driven by reductions in the us government s budgetary forecast and funding levels in the military markets resulting in declines in the engineering services business from lower rdt e budgets  reduced demand for specific engineering services as a result of increases in government in sourcing and reduced congressional earmarks 
as a result of these market changes  the company lowered its forecasted multiyear sales and cash flow analyses developed in because the majority of miltec s business is us government related  the reduction in the us defense budget has had an unfavorable impact on the fair value assessment 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a non cash charge of  at dti relating to its miltec reporting unit for the impairment of goodwill 
the test as of december  indicated the book value of miltec exceeded the fair value of the business 
the impairment charge was primarily driven by adverse equity market conditions that caused a decrease in current market multiples and the company s stock price as of december  compared with the test performed as of december  thus the impairment charge recorded in was driven by external market factors as opposed to the reduction in stock price multiples which was the primary cause for the impairment charge in the charge in both and reduced goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of miltec and did not impact the company s normal business operations 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations  weighted average cost of capital wacc  and terminal value assumptions 
the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company s consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider risk profiles associated with growth projection risks 
the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of discounted cash flow model 
due to many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of the company s recorded goodwill  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company s impairment analysis 
prior to recording the goodwill impairment charge at miltec  the company tested the purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets at the business as required by asc accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and the carrying value of these assets was determined not to be impaired 
on december   the company acquired dynabil industries  inc  a privately owned company based in coxsackie  new york  for  net of cash acquired and excluding acquisition costs and subsequently changed its name to ducommun aerostructures new york inc das new york 
das new york is a leading provider of titanium and aluminum structural components and assemblies for commercial and military aerospace applications 
the acquisition was funded from internally generated cash  notes to the sellers  and borrowings of approximately  under the company s credit agreement 
sales  gross profit as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales  the effective tax rate and the diluted earnings per share in  and  respectively  were as follows sales in s gross profit of sales sg a expense of sales effective tax rate diluted earnings per share the company manufactures components and assemblies principally for domestic and foreign commercial and military aircraft  helicopter and space programs 
the company s miltec subsidiary provides engineering  technical and program management services almost entirely for united states defense  space and homeland security programs 
the company s mix of military  commercial and space business in  and  respectively  was approximately as follows military commercial space total the company is dependent on boeing commercial aircraft  the c aircraft and the apache and blackhawk helicopter programs 
sales to these programs  as a percentage of total sales  for  and  respectively  were approximately as follows boeing commercial aircraft boeing c aircraft united technologies boeing apache helicopter all others total net sales in were  compared to net sales of  for the increase in net sales in from was primarily due to sales from das new york  which was acquired in december sales in from das new york were  sales for the balance of the company s business excluding das new york was  lower  primarily due to a decrease in sales for the apache helicopter program and significant decreases in the regional and business aircraft markets which began to experience a slowdown at the beginning of operating income for was lower than operating income for was negatively impacted by inventory reserves and valuation adjustments and adjustments for uncollected sales tax on customer sales at das 
in  the company recorded an inventory reserve of  related to inventory on hand for eclipse  which filed for bankruptcy  and an inventory valuation adjustment of  related to costs that were capitalized in error in prior periods 
in the company recorded a liability for uncollected sales taxes of  on tooling sales to its customers during the period through operating income for and was negatively impacted by non cash goodwill impairment at ducommun technologies  inc dti relating to its miltec reporting unit of  and  respectively 
operating income for was favorably impacted by a reduction in environmental reserves of  as result of changes in the company s estimate of previously recorded environmental liabilities 
interest expense was higher in  due to higher debt levels and higher interest rates 
income tax expense decrease in due to lower income before taxes  partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered 
revenue from products sold under long term contracts is recognized by the company on the same basis as other sale transactions 
the company recognizes revenue on the sale of services including prototype products based on the type of contract time and materials  cost plus reimbursement and firm fixed price 
revenue is recognized i on time and materials contracts as time is spent at hourly rates  which are negotiated with customers  plus the cost of any allowable materials and out of pocket expenses  ii on cost plus reimbursement contracts based on direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of cost  a fixed amount or a performance based award fee  and iii on fixed price service contracts on the percentage of completion method measured by the percentage of costs incurred to estimated total costs 
provision for estimated losses on contracts the company records provisions for estimated losses on contracts considering total estimated costs to complete the contract compared to total anticipated revenues in the period in which such losses are identified 
the provisions for estimated losses on contracts require management to make certain estimates and assumptions  including those with respect to the future revenue under a contract and the future cost to complete the contract 
management s estimate of the future cost to complete a contract may include assumptions as to improvements in manufacturing efficiency and reductions in operating and material costs 
if any of these or other assumptions and estimates do not materialize in the future  the company may be required to record additional provisions for estimated losses on contracts 
goodwill the company s business acquisitions have resulted in goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  comparable company analyses  discount rates and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if actual results do not meet these estimates  if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  or if adverse equity market conditions cause a decrease in current market multiples and the company s stock price the company may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets 
in the event that a goodwill impairment charge is required  it could adversely affect the operating results and financial position of the company 
other intangible assets the company amortizes purchased other intangible assets with finite lives over the estimated economic lives of the assets  ranging from one to fourteen years generally using the straight line method 
the value of other intangibles acquired through business combinations has been estimated using present value techniques which involve estimates of future cash flows 
actual results could vary  potentially resulting in impairment charges 
accounting for stock based compensation the company uses a black scholes valuation model in determining the stock based compensation expense for options  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
the company has two award populations  one with an option vesting term of four years and the other with an option vesting term of one year 
the company estimated the forfeiture rate based on its historic experience 
for performance and restricted stock units  the company calculates compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  on a straight line basis over the requisite service performance period of the awards 
the performance stock units vest based on a three year cumulative performance cycle 
the company has two restricted stock units  one restricted stock unit vests at the end of five years and the other restricted stock unit vests equally over a three year period ending in the company estimates the forfeiture rate based on its historic experience 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
inventoried costs include raw materials  outside processing  direct labor and allocated overhead  adjusted for any abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage incurred  but do not include any selling  general and administrative expense 
costs under long term contracts are accumulated into  and removed from  inventory on the same basis as other contracts 
the company assesses the inventory carrying value and reduces it  if necessary  to its net realizable value based on customer orders on hand  and internal demand forecasts using management s best estimates given information currently available 
the company s customer demand can fluctuate significantly caused by factors beyond the control of the company 
the company maintains an allowance for potentially excess and obsolete inventories and inventories that are carried at costs that are higher than their estimated net realizable values 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in demand and not meeting expectations  inventory write downs may be required 
environmental liabilities environmental liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and costs can be reasonably estimated 
generally  the timing of these accruals coincides with the completion of a feasibility study or the company s commitment to a formal plan of action 
further  the company reviews and updates its environmental accruals as circumstances change and or addition information is obtained that reasonably could be expected to have a meaningful effect on the outcome of a matter or the estimated cost thereof

the majority of guarantees and indemnities do not provide any limitations of the maximum potential future payments the company could be obligated to make 
historically  payments related to these guarantees and indemnities have been immaterial 
the company estimates the fair value of its indemnification obligations as insignificant based on this history and insurance coverage and has  therefore  not recorded any liability for these guarantees and indemnities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

the boeing company and ducommun inc  filed in the united states district court for the district of kansas the district court 
the lawsuit is a qui tam action brought against the boeing company boeing and ducommun on behalf of the united states of america for violations of the united states false claims act 
the lawsuit alleges that ducommun sold unapproved parts to the boeing commercial airplanes wichita division which were installed by boeing in aircraft ultimately sold to the united states government 
the number of boeing aircraft subject to the lawsuit has been reduced to aircraft following the district court s granting of partial summary judgment in favor of boeing and ducommun 
the lawsuit seeks damages  civil penalties and other relief from the defendants for presenting or causing to be presented false claims for payment to the united states government 
although the amount of alleged damages are not specified  the lawsuit seeks damages in an amount equal to three times the amount of damages the united states government sustained because of the defendants actions  plus a civil penalty of  for each false claim made on or before september   and  for each false claim made on or after september   together with attorneys fees and costs 
the company intends to defend itself vigorously against the lawsuit 
the company  at this time  is unable to estimate what  if any  liability it may have in connection with the lawsuit 
das has been directed by california environmental agencies to investigate and take corrective action for ground water contamination at its facilities located in el mirage and monrovia  california 
based on currently available information  the company has established a reserve for its estimated liability for such investigation and corrective action in the approximate amount of  das also faces liability as a potentially responsible party for hazardous waste disposed at two landfills located in casmalia and west covina  california 
das and other companies and government entities have entered into consent decrees with respect to each landfill with the united states environmental protection agency and or california environmental agencies under which certain investigation  remediation and maintenance activities are being performed 
based upon currently available information  the company has established a reserve for its estimated liability in connection with the landfills in the approximate amount of  the company s ultimate liability in connection with these matters will depend upon a number of factors  including changes in existing laws and regulations  the design and cost of construction  operation and maintenance activities  and the allocation of liability among potentially responsible parties 
in the normal course of business  ducommun and its subsidiaries are defendants in certain other litigation  claims and inquiries  including matters relating to environmental laws 
in addition  the company makes various commitments and incurs contingent liabilities 
while it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters  the company does not presently expect that any sum it may be required to pay in connection with these matters would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
