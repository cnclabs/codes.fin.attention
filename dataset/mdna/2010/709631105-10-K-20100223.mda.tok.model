overview we are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments water and technical products 
our water group is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement  storage  treatment and enjoyment of water 
our technical products group is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal management markets  designing and manufacturing standard  modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical components and protect the people that use them 
in  we expect our water group and technical products group to generate approximately and of our total revenues  respectively 
our water group has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from approximately million in to approximately billion in we believe the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for clean water and the large global market size of which we have identified a target market totaling billion 
our vision is to be a leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement  storage  treatment and enjoyment of water 
on february   we sold our npt business to pool corporation in a cash transaction 
the results of npt have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the assets and liabilities of npt have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
on june   we entered into a transaction with ge that was accounted for as an acquisition of an percent ownership interest in ge s global water softener and residential water filtration business in exchange for a percent interest in our global water softener and residential water filtration business 
the acquisition was effected through the formation of two new entities  a us entity and an international entity  collectively pentair residential filtration or prf into which we and ge contributed certain assets  properties  liabilities and operations representing our respective global water softener and residential water filtration businesses 
we are an percent owner of the new entities and ge is a percent owner 
with the formation of prf  we believe we are better positioned to serve residential customers with industry leading technical applications in the areas of water conditioning  whole house filtration  point of use water management and water sustainability and expect to accelerate revenue growth by selling ge s existing residential conditioning products through our sales channels 
on december   we sold our spa bath business to balboa water group in a cash transaction 
the results of spa bath have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the assets and liabilities of spa bath have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
our technical products group operates in a large global market with significant potential for growth in industry segments such as energy  medical and security and defense 
we believe we have the largest industrial and commercial distribution network in north america for enclosures and the highest brand recognition in the industry in north america 
from mid through  the technical products group experienced significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital spending in the industrial and commercial markets and over capacity and weak demand in the data communication and telecommunication 
table of contents markets 
from through  sales volumes increased due to the addition of new distributors  new products  price increases and higher demand in targeted markets 
in  sales revenues in our technical products group declined significantly due to the impact of the global recession 
key trends and uncertainties our sales revenue for the full year of was approximately billion  decreasing from sales in the prior year 
our water group sales declined in the year to approximately billion  compared to the same period in our technical products group sales decreased to approximately billion in compared to the same period in the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in and will likely impact our results in and beyond most markets we serve slowed dramatically in late and throughout as a result of the global recession 
these markets are showing signs of stabilizing  although at lower levels than we expected would be the case twelve months ago 
in response to market conditions over the past year  we significantly restructured our operations to both reduce cost and reduce or relocate capacity 
because our businesses are significantly affected by general economic trends  further deterioration in our most important markets addressed below would likely have an adverse impact on our results of operation for and beyond 
we have also identified specific market opportunities that we have been and are pursuing that we find attractive  both within and outside the united states 
we are reinforcing our businesses to more effectively address these opportunities through research and development and additional sales and marketing resources 
unless we successfully penetrate these product and geographic markets  our organic growth will be limited due to continuing stagnation or slower growth in other markets 
new home building and new pool starts have contracted for each of the past four years in the united states and have slowed significantly in europe as well 
overall  we believe approximately of sales by our water businesses flow  filtration and pool equipment are used in residential applications for new construction  remodeling and repair  replacement and refurbishment 
we saw some stabilization of order rates in the second half of and anticipate continuing stability  but not significant volume increases  in we do believe that housing construction will improve in from historically low levels in  and we anticipate a slightly stronger market will have a favorable impact on these businesses  but our participation in trends appears to lag approximately six months from inception 
industrial  communications and commercial markets for all of our businesses  including commercial and industrial construction  also slowed significantly over the past year 
order rates and sales stabilized in our industrial and communications businesses somewhat in the fourth quarter  although commercial and industrial construction markets are still shrinking 
we believe that the outlook for most of these markets is mixed  and we expect that construction will continue to decline over year over year in we experienced material cost and other deflation in a number of our businesses during we expect the current economic environment will result in continuing price volatility for many of our raw materials 
we believe that the impact of lower commodity prices will continue to impact us favorably in the first half of  but we are uncertain on the timing and impact of a return of cost inflation as the economy improves over the next year 
our unfunded pension liability increased in from million to million  primarily reflecting our reduced investment return and significantly lower asset values in our us defined benefit plans at the end of that year 
primarily as a result of better investment returns and higher contributions in  our unfunded pension liabilities declined to approximately million as of the end of the contributions included a discretionary contribution of million in december to improve plan balances and reduce future contributions 
we anticipate that our future pension expense will increase over levels 
we have a long term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds conversion of our net income 
we define free cash flow as cash flow from continuing operating activities less capital 
table of contents expenditures plus proceeds from sale of property and equipment 
free cash flow for the full year was approximately million  or of our net income  this amount was below our target of million 
the shortfall reflects the discretionary contribution to our pension plan of million in december  which we undertook in large part because of our somewhat higher than anticipated free cash flow for the fourth quarter and full year 
in addition  we did not sell customer receivables in as we have in prior years 
our target for free cash flow in continues to be greater than or equal to conversion of our net income for the year 
last year  we instituted several measures internally to maintain our strong collection experience and to decrease working capital 
we are continuing to target reductions in working capital  and particularly inventory  as a percentage of sales 
see our discussion of other financial measures under the caption liquidity and capital resources in this report 
we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group 
end user demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is normally at seasonal highs from april to august 
the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale early buy programs generally including extended payment terms and or additional discounts 
demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by economic conditions and weather patterns  particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 
we believe that this seasonality will continue in the second and third quarters of  as it did modestly in  but are uncertain of the size and impact of the seasonal spike for the year  and contemplate that any seasonal impact will likely be less than we have historically seen 
we experienced year over year unfavorable foreign currency effects on net sales and operating results in and  as a result of the weakening of the us dollar in relation to other foreign currencies 
due to recent strength in the us dollar  we anticipate some modest unfavorable foreign exchange impact  but believe longer term that foreign exchange will be favorable 
our currency effect is primarily for the us dollar against the euro  which may or may not trend favorably in the future 
the effective income tax rate for was 
we estimate our effective tax rate for the full year to be between and 
we continue to actively pursue initiatives to reduce our effective tax rate 
the tax rate in any quarter can be affected positively or negatively by adjustments that are required to be reported in the specific quarter of resolution 
outlook in  our operating objectives include the following increasing our vertical market focus within each of our global business units to grow in those markets in which we have competitive advantages  leveraging our technological capabilities to increasingly generate innovative new products  driving operating excellence through lean enterprise initiatives  with special focus on sourcing and supply management  cash flow management  and lean operations  and stressing proactive talent development  particularly in international management and other key functional areas 
on february   we announced our results of operations for fiscal year and our earnings guidance for the first quarter of of a range of to per share on a diluted basis for the full year of a range of to per share on a diluted basis 
prior full year guidance was to equal per share or higher on a fully diluted basis 
we are uncertain of the trajectory of the economic recovery  both in the united states and globally  for the balance of the year and on into as noted above  significant deterioration in general economic conditions in our primary markets and geographies would adversely impact our anticipated annual revenues and financial performance 
this outlook is based on several variables 
first  our guidance anticipates modest organic revenue gains in our businesses as a whole in the low to mid single digit range as a result of overall market conditions  which we expect to bring our total revenue to approximately billion for the full year 
second  based upon that 
table of contents revenue expectation  we project net earnings of to per share as a result of higher operating margins due to carryover of productivity gains from our restructuring projects in and favorable commodities pricing in the first half of  offset somewhat by reinstatement of certain employee benefits and wage increases and higher spending on research and development  and sales and marketing resources 
third  we believe our tax rate and pension expense will be slightly higher than in  with some reduction in interest expense as a result of lower borrowing levels and continuing low interest rates 
we also believe that should we experience volume gains in excess of those we are projecting  we will be able to convert those extra revenues into operating income at an approximate rate  consistent with our productivity assumptions 
our guidance assumes an absence of significant acquisitions or divestitures in we continue to look for smaller acquisitions to expand our geographic reach internationally  expand our presence in our various channels to market and acquire technologies and products to broaden our businesses capabilities to serve additional markets 
we may also consider the divestiture or closure of discrete business units to further focus our businesses on their most attractive markets 
the ability to achieve our operating objectives and guidance will depend  to a certain extent  on factors outside our control
