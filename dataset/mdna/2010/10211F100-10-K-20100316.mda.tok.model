table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our future results of operations and the other forward looking statements contained herein  particularly the statements regarding growth in the medical products industry  capital spending  research and development  and marketing and general and administrative expenses  involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
in addition to the factors discussed above  there are other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  such as business conditions and the general state of the economy  competitive factors including rival manufacturers availability of components at reasonable prices  risk of nonpayment of accounts receivable  risks associated with foreign operations  and litigation involving intellectual property and consumer issues 
we believe that we have the product mix  facilities  personnel  competitive edge  operating cash flows and financial resources for business success in the immediate future year and distant future after year  but future revenues  costs  margins  product mix and profits are all subject to the influence of a number of factors  as discussed above 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes 
executive level overview we are a medical device company engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of electrosurgical devices 
our medical products include a wide range of devices including electrosurgical generators and accessories  cauteries  medical lighting  nerve locators and other products 
we internally divide our operations into three product lines 
electrosurgical products  battery operated cauteries and other products 
the electrosurgical line sells electrosurgical products which include desiccators  generators  electrodes  electrosurgical pencils and various ancillary disposable products 
these products are used in surgery for the cutting and coagulation of tissue 
battery operated cauteries are used for precise hemostasis to stop bleeding in ophthalmology and in other fields 
our other revenues are derived from nerve locators  disposable and reusable penlights  medical lighting  license fees  development fees and other miscellaneous income 
most of the company s products are marketed through medical distributors  which distribute to more than  hospitals  and to doctors and other health care facilities 
new distributors are contacted through responses to our advertising in international and domestic medical journals and domestic or international trade shows 
international sales represented of total revenues in as compared with in and in the company s products are sold in more than countries through local dealers which are coordinated by sales and marketing personnel at the clearwater  florida facility 
our business is generally not seasonal in nature 
outlook for during we continued to make progress on the development and marketing of our new products and technologies 
we are encouraged by the continued positive acceptance of our new seer tissue resection device orders have already been received and we have already established a direct and specialty sales team for this product 
although entry for this product into the hospital market liver resection has been slower and more challenging than initially anticipated due to changes in hospital purchasing procedures and environments which now consist of several levels of approval boards  we remain optimistic on the sales potential for this and other related products 
in addition  although the challenging economic conditions and global recession have adversely impacted our capital equipment sales in as evidenced by the downward trend in the sale of our generators  we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will show modest improvement starting in the second half of due to improved economic conditions and the anticipated introduction of new products 

table of contents we have continued the development of new products in and submitted k s to the food and drug administration fda for the boss  laproscopy seer  seal n cut  icon vs  icon gs j plasma and resistick ii coated blades 
the k s for the laproscopy seer and icon gs j plasma  and coated blades were received in recently  we received fda clearance to market resistick ii and the icon vs generator 
in august  we received clearance to market our j plasma technology icon gs 
j plasma includes an improved  redesigned system with added features to increase efficiency for the surgeon  while reducing manufacturing costs 
we are developing marketing strategies for j plasma  and believe the product will be versatile  with possible uses in a range of surgical specialties 
in today s economic environment  marked by historic uncertainty  forecasting has become increasingly more difficult 
we have and will always  take a conservative approach 
every effort has been made to provide an outlook based on our experience and knowledge  however  variations beyond our ability to predict or control often impact forecasting which may result in a change in this outlook

interest expense increased progressively from through mainly as a direct result of interest incurred on debt originated in we had no debt in 
this debt was used to primarily acquire and renovate our new facility and for working capital purposes 
income taxes our income tax provision for the year ended december  was approximately  compared with approximately  for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was approximately for the year ended december   which is less than our statutory rates because of the deductibility of stock based compensation and certain research and development tax credits we used during the year

federal tax provision state taxes net of federal benefit stock based compensation research and development credits other valuation allowance at december   management believed there was a risk that substantially all of our net operating losses might not be realizable and  accordingly  a valuation allowance was recorded against them 
during the year ended december   management determined that such valuation allowances were no longer necessary  and accordingly  the valuation allowances were reversed  resulting in a benefit for income taxes being recorded for the anticipated utilization 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital at december  was million compared with million at december  accounts receivable days sales outstanding were days and days at december  and respectively 
the number of days worth of sales in inventory  which is the total inventory available for production divided by the month average cost of materials  increased days to days equating to an inventory turn ratio of at december  from days and an inventory turn ratio of at december  the higher number of days worth of sales in inventory which translated into a lower inventory turnover rate is mainly due to the decrease in sales related to our generator product lines which contain a greater number of parts compared to all our other products

table of contents we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents at december  we believe our cash on hand  as well as anticipated cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating cash commitments for the next year 
should additional funds be required  we have secured additional borrowing capacity with rbc bank usa 
see below on december  rbc bank usa increased our secured revolving line of credit facility to million from the previous million and on the same date provided us with a separate additional credit facility for up to million specific to financing new equipment purchases 
advances under the million line of credit are due on demand and bear interest at a rate of libor plus with a minimum floor rate of and are secured by a perfected first security interest in our inventory  accounts receivable  and equipment 
the million facility related to equipment purchases provides for a year draw up period followed by a year term period and bears interest also at libor plus with a minimum floor of and will be secured by a perfected first security interest in the new equipment purchased 
this equipment credit facility also allows the company the option of financing purchased equipment at of the cost through either a traditional loan or through rbc leasing at the time of purchase 
subsequent available borrowings for both these credit facilities is subject to a borrowing base utilizing a percentage of eligible receivables  inventories  and any assigned cash along with certain financial ratios  specifically maintaining a ratio of debt to tangible net worth of less than to  a ratio of total funded debt to ebitda of less than to excluding the industrial revenue bond note balance which had an original principal amount of million  and a ratio of minimum debt service coverage of to measured on a rolling four quarter basis

the company s future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year and agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business are summarized as follows in thousands description years ending december  operating leases employment agreements purchase commitments critical accounting estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  we have adopted various accounting policies 
our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to inventories  intangible assets  property  plant and equipment  legal proceedings  research and development  warranty obligations  product liability  sales returns and discounts  and income taxes are updated as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we base our estimates on historical experience  or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may materially differ f rom these estimates 
estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made  and other materially different estimates could have been reasonably made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
our critical accounting estimates include the following inventory reserves when necessary we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell our products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis 
such marketplace changes may cause our products to become obsolete 
we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would unfavorably affect future operating results 
long lived assets we review long lived assets which are held and used  including property and equipment and intangible assets  for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its expected useful life and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices and volumes for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors that are inherently difficult to forecast 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  we record an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow tec hnique 
share based compensation under the company s stock option plan  options to purchase common shares of the company may be granted to key employees  officers and directors of the company by the board of directors 
the company accounts for stock options in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation stockcompensation sfas statement r with option expense amortized over the vesting period based on the binomial lattice option pricing model fair value on the grant date  which includes a number of estimates that affect the amount of our expense 
income taxes the provision for income taxes includes federal  foreign  state and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted marginal tax rates 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
deferred income tax expenses or credits are based on the changes in the asset or liability from period to period 
we periodically have net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards available to reduce future taxable income 
future tax benefits for net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
this determination is based on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax  business and other planning strategies will enable us to utilize the operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to realize these future tax benefits or that future valuation allowances will not be required 
to the extent that available evidence raises doubt about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 

table of contents it is our policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
to the extent that the probable tax outcome of these uncertain tax positions changes  such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
at december   we believe we have appropriately accounted for any unrecognized tax benefits 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or we are required to pay amounts in excess of the liability  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our short term investments consist of cash  cash equivalents and overnight investments 
as such we do not believe we are exposed to significant interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid overnight money market investments 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on december   this change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date
