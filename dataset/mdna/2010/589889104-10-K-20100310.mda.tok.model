item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we reported record sales and earnings for the twelve months ended december  this improvement  compared to our results  was largely the result of a increase in sales  an improvement in gross margins of basis points and a reduction in our effective income tax rate of basis points  all of which offset higher selling  general and administrative expenses as well as research and development expenses  primarily associated with our acquisition and operation of the business and assets we acquired from alveolus in march of the net of these factors produced record earnings of million for  up from the prior year 
during  we completed two of the largest acquisitions in our history  with the purchase of the alveolus assets and the purchase of the en snare product line from hatch 
the purchase of the alveolus assets enabled us to enter into the gastroenterology and pulmonary markets and further diversify our product offerings in the medical device industry 
we believe the en snare product line will serve as a foundation for entry into the snare market and will allow us to develop snares for use in the gastroenterology market 
products associated with these two transactions all have gross margins in excess of our existing gross margins 
we intend to continue to explore acquisition opportunities or product purchases similar to our transactions  in an effort to enhance our product offerings  improve our overall gross margins and increase our net income 
for the year ended december   we reported net sales of million  up million or over net sales 
net sales growth in was primarily driven by increased sales of our stand alone products up million or  including en snare royalties  hemostasis valves  needles and diagnostic wires  custom kit and procedure tray products up million or  sales of products from our asset acquisitions of alveolus and biosearch of million  and sales of catheters up million or  particularly our prelude sheath product line  mini access catheter product line and resolve locking draining catheter line 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was for the year ended december   compared to for year ended december  this improvement can be attributed primarily to lower average fixed overhead unit costs through increased productivity as fixed costs are shared over an increased number of units and a reduction in material costs 
net income increased for the year ended december  to million  compared to million for the prior year  an increase of results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses income from operations income before income tax expense net income our net sales increased by million  or  in  compared to an increase of million  or  in and an increase of million  or  in we report sales in five product categories

table of contents twelve months ended december  change change change stand alone devices custom kits procedure trays inflation devices catheters gastroenterology total our sales increased during  notwithstanding the fact that the markets for many of our products experienced slight pricing declines as our customers tried to reduce their costs 
substantially all of the increase in our revenues was attributable to increased unit sales 
sales by our european direct sales force are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the natural currency of a foreign country and the us dollar 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased sales by in compared to  increased sales by in compared to  and increased sales by in compared to historically  an important part of our revenue growth came from increases in the number of procedures performed for patients in a given year 
starting in april  the growth rate of coronary stents and other related procedures in the us dropped significantly  reducing our historical growth rate for some interventional cardiology products sold by our us direct sales force 
new products have been another source of revenue growth 
in  and  our sales of new products represented  and sales  respectively 
included in those sales are revenues from recent acquisitions of  and for  and  respectively 
the third main source of revenue increases came from market share gains in our existing product lines 
international sales in were approximately million  or of total sales  international sales in were approximately million  or of total sales  international sales in were approximately million  or of total sales 
these increases primarily resulted from greater acceptance of our products in international markets  ongoing growth in our european direct sales  and to a lesser degree  increased sales related to improvement in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar  as discussed above 
our total direct sales in france  germany  the uk  belgium  the netherlands  denmark  sweden  austria and ireland were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was  and  in  and  respectively 
the improved gross margins in can be attributed primarily to lower average fixed overhead unit costs through increased productivity as fixed costs are shared over an increased number of units and a reduction in material costs 
the increase in gross margins in resulted primarily from lower average fixed overhead unit costs resulting from increased production unit costs decreased as fixed costs were shared over an increased number of units  lower unit costs for products manufactured in mexico  customer price increases and production automation 
these improvements also helped offset raw material and production labor cost increases that occurred during the increase in gross margins in was principally the result of production efficiencies resulting in lower headcount  product mix improvement  the transfer of the manufacturing process of four products to mexico and certain automation projects 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or  in  million  or  in over  million  or  in over the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses in were primarily due to the increased expense associated with our acquisition and operation of the business and assets acquired from alveolus of million and the hiring of additional domestic and international sales representatives 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly in when compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of higher commissions commensurate with higher sales  management and sales bonuses for meeting quarterly and annually objectives  increased travel related expenses and increased national account administration fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were also affected by approximately  of damages net of insurance reimbursement of  sustained by our angleton  texas facility during hurricane ike in september the significant basis points decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of operating leverage from reducing head count  while increasing sales 
research and development expenses increased to million in  compared to million in the increase in research and development expenses in related  in large part  to research and development projects for the alveolus business we acquired of million and growth in our historical research and development projects  
table of contents some of which are nearing completion 
research and development expenses increased to million in  compared to million in our research and development expense for increased to million  compared to million in the increase in research and development expenses in and was related primarily to research and development head count additions and indirect costs to support an increase in the number of new products we launched 
our research and development expenses as a percentage of sales were for  for and for we have a full pipeline of new products and management believes that we have an effective level of capabilities and expertise to continue the flow of new internally developed products into the future 
our effective income tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate for over was primarily related to the profitability of our irish operations  which are taxed at a lower tax rate than our us and other foreign operations  research and development tax credits generated from our irish operations  and investment gains sustained in our deferred compensation that are not deductible for tax purposes 
the increase in the effective income tax rate for over was primarily the result of investment losses sustained in our deferred compensation plan that are not deductible for tax purposes 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate for over was primarily the result of the unrecognized tax benefits which expired on our federal  state and foreign tax returns and a non taxed gain related to corporate owned variable life insurance contracts for our deferred compensation plan 
our other income for  and was approximately   and  respectively 
the decrease in other income for over was primarily the result of a decrease in interest income attributable to lower average cash balances  when compared to the corresponding periods in the increase in other income for over and over was primarily the result of an increase in interest income attributable to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates 
our net income for  and was approximately  million and million  respectively 
net income for was favorably affected by increased sales volumes and higher gross margins  a lower effective income tax rate all of which offset higher selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses  primarily associated with our acquisition of the alveolus assets in the first quarter of net income for was positively affected by increased sales volumes and higher gross margins and partially offset by higher effective income tax rates 
net income for was positively affected by increased sales volumes  higher gross margins  lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales and a lower effective income tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources capital commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our capital commitments and contractual obligations as of december   including operating lease payments and office lease payments  as well as the future periods in which such payments are currently anticipated to become due payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years line of credit operating leases royalty obligations total contractual cash we have approximately million of unrecognized tax positions that have been recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are not reflected in the foregoing contractual obligations table due to uncertainty as to when such amounts may be settled 
additional information regarding our capital commitments and contractual obligations  including royalty payments  is contained in notes  and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  set forth in item below 
cash flows our cash flow from operations was million in  an increase of million over this increase in cash flow from operations in  when compared to  resulted primarily from an increase in net income 
our 
table of contents working capital for  and  was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in working capital in from was primarily the result of expenditures of approximately million associated with our acquisition of the alveolus assets and the en snare product line 
the increase in working capital for over was primarily the result of an increase in cash generated from our net income and cash generated from the issuance of shares of common stock related to employee stock option exercises 
the increase in working capital for over was primarily the result of an increase in cash net of the reduction in inventories of million as we focused on improving our inventory turns 
on december   we entered into an unsecured loan agreement with bank of america  na bank of america  whereby bank of america agreed to provide us a line of credit in the amount of million 
our outstanding borrowings on this loan as of december  and were million and  respectively 
our interest rate as of december  was set at 
available borrowings under this line of credit as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
on december   we entered into an unsecured loan agreement with zions first national bank zions  whereby zions agreed to provide us a line of credit in the amount of million 
the loan expired on december   however  was extended for an additional three years to december  we had outstanding and million available under this line of credit as of december   and historically  we have incurred significant expenses in connection with new facilities  production automation  product development and the introduction of new products 
during  we spent a substantial amount of cash  million  in connection with our acquisition of certain assets and product lines 
in the event we pursue and complete similar transactions or acquisitions in the future  additional funds will likely be required to meet our strategic needs  which may require us to consider raising additional funds in the debt or equity markets 
we currently believe that our existing cash balances  future cash flows from operations  sales of equity and existing lines of credit will be adequate to fund our current and future planned operations for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies the sec has requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies 
the sec has indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the representation of the registrant s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ and may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates could occur in the future from period to period 
our management has discussed the development and selection of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the following paragraphs identify our most critical accounting policies inventory obsolescence reserve 
our management reviews on a regular basis inventory quantities on hand for unmarketable and or slow moving products that may expire prior to being sold 
this review of inventory quantities for unmarketable and or slow moving products is based on estimates of forecasted product demand prior to expiration lives 
if market conditions become less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we believe that the amount included in our obsolescence reserve has been a historically accurate estimate of the unmarketable and or slow moving products that may expire prior to being sold 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
a majority of our receivables are with hospitals which  over our history  have demonstrated favorable collection rates 
therefore  we have experienced relatively minimal bad debts from hospital customers 
in limited circumstances  we have written off bad debts as the result of the termination of our business relationships with foreign distributors 
the most significant write offs over our history have come from us packers who bundle our products in surgical trays 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts relating to estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is based upon historical experience and a review of individual customer balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  then additional allowances may be required 
stock based compensation 
we measure share based compensation cost at the grant date based on the value of the award and recognize the cost as an expense over the term of the vesting period 
judgment is required in estimating 
table of contents the fair value of share based awards granted and their expected forfeiture rate 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
income taxes 
under our accounting policies  we initially recognize a tax position in our financial statements when it becomes likely that the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authorities assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
although we believe our provisions for unrecognized tax positions are reasonable  we can make no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which we have reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals 
the tax law is subject to varied interpretations and we have taken positions related to certain matters where the law is subject to interpretation 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provisions and operating results in the period s in which we make such determination 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment 
we test our goodwill balances as of july of each year for impairment  or whenever impairment indicators arise 
we utilize several reporting units in evaluating goodwill for impairment 
we assess the estimated fair value of reporting units based on discounted future cash flows 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over implied fair value of that goodwill 
this analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows and the length of time they will occur  which is based on internal forecasts and a determination of a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
this analysis requires similar significant judgments as those discussed above regarding goodwill  except for cash flows are based on an undiscounted cash flow to determine the fair value of the intangible 
all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements describing accounting policies governing each of these matters  set forth in item below 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risk relates to changes in the value of the euro and gbp relative to the value of the us dollar 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in and our principal currency is  the us dollar 
a portion of our revenues million  representing approximately of our aggregate revenues for the year ended december  was attributable to sales that were denominated in foreign currencies 
the balance of our international sales was denominated in us dollars 
certain expenses are also denominated in foreign currencies  which partially offset risks associated with fluctuations of exchanges rates between foreign currencies on the one hand and the us dollar on the other hand 
because of our euro and gbp denominated revenues and expenses  in a year in which our euro and gbp denominated revenues exceed our euro and gbp based expenses  the value of such euro and gbp denominated net income increases if the value of the euro and gbp increase relative to the value of the us dollar and decreases if the value of the euro and gbp decrease relative to the value of the u 
s 
dollar 
during the year ended december   the exchange rate between our foreign currencies against the us dollar resulted in a decrease of our gross revenues of approximately million and an increase of in gross profit 
on november   we forecasted a net exposure for december  representing the difference between euro and gbp denominated receivables and euro denominated payables of approximately  euros and  gbps 
in order to partially offset such risks at november   we entered into a day forward contract for the euro and gbp with a notional amount of approximately  euros and notional amount of  gbps 
we enter into similar transactions at various times during the year to partially offset exchange rate risks we bear throughout the year 
these contracts are marked to market at each month end 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded a net gain of approximately   and  respectively  which is included in other income expense  on foreign currency transactions 
we do not purchase or hold derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the fair value of our open positions at december  and was not material 
we are also subject to market risk related to variable rate debt 
as of december   our operating line of credit with bank of america has a variable rate which is tied to libor rates 
we do not believe our interest expense would be materially affected by changes in interest rates
