in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth in the item a risk factors section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we provide business solutions for human resources which include a comprehensive suite of on demand software applications and complementary services  including outsourcing services and consulting  to help global organizations recruit high performing individuals and to foster optimal work environments to increase employee productivity and retention 
we employ a large force of organizational and industrial psychologists and statisticians who study the science of human behavior and its impact on business outcomes 
this research is the foundation of our suite of software applications and supporting services that enable our customers to improve business results through human resources 
based on our years of experience assisting customers in addressing their human resource requirements we believe our software applications and services form solutions that enable our customers to improve the effectiveness of their talent acquisition programs  increase employee productivity and retention  measure key hr metrics and make their talent acquisition and employee performance management program more efficient 
since  we have focused on providing talent acquisition and employee performance management solutions on a subscription basis and currently generate a significant portion of our revenue from these subscriptions 
our customers typically purchase multi year subscriptions with an average length of approximately two years 
for the years ended december and subscription revenue represented approximately and of our total revenue  respectively 
we generate the remainder of our revenue from discrete professional services that are not provided as part of an integrated solution on a subscription basis 
these subscription based solutions provide us with a recurring revenue stream and we believe represent a more compelling opportunity in terms of growth and profitability than discrete professional services 
we sell our solutions to large and medium sized organizations through our direct sales force 
as of december   we had a customer base of approximately  companies  including approximately companies on the fortune list published in may our customer base includes companies that we billed for services during the year ended december  and does not necessarily indicate an ongoing relationship with each such customer 
our top customers contributed approximately million  or  of our total revenue for the year ended december  in october  unemployment in the united states peaked at which will likely adversely affect our business in and may affect our business thereafter 
however  the extent or degree to which we may be affected by these events is extremely difficult to predict 
the uncertain economic prospects being experienced by our customers will likely translate into slower growth  or contraction  for us  since a substantial portion of our business is dependent upon our customers hiring and human capital needs 
however  we believe that  by optimizing our internal resources for the current business conditions  we can minimize these adverse effects and emerge from this economic crisis with a return to our historic operating margins 
due to the economic downturn some of our customers  facing uncertainty and cost pressures in their own businesses  have indicated that they are waiting to purchase our products and are otherwise increasingly seeking purchasing terms and conditions that are less favorable to us 
as a result  during the year ended december  and  our customers renewed approximately and  respectively  of the aggregate value of multi year subscriptions for our on demand talent acquisition and performance management solution contracts subject to renewal during the period rather than our historical renewal rate of approximately 
as the business environment improves we expect renewal rates to improve to the range from a long term perspective 
background we commenced operations in as a provider of recruiting services to a wide variety of industries 
in  we offered our first automated talent acquisition system and by we had expanded our business to provide employee research  employee performance management technology and consulting services 
in late  responding to a growing demand from our customers  we began to provide comprehensive human capital management services integrated with on demand software 
between and  we acquired businesses that collectively enabled us to offer comprehensive human capital management hcm services integrated with on demand technology 
over the past eleven years  we have pursued a strategy designed to focus our business on talent acquisition and employee performance management solutions and reduce our strategic focus on discrete professional services that generated less predictable revenue streams and lower margins 
to that end in  we exited our temporary staffing business  in and  we acquired four businesses which enhanced our screening and behavioral assessment solutions and skills testing technologies  since  we reduced our strategic focus on position specific recruiting services  in  we discontinued our oracle implementation business and discontinued and sold our pharmaceutical training division  in  we expanded our presence in north america and enhanced our customer base through our acquisition of scottworks solutions  inc  in  we enhanced our talent acquisition solutions and customer base through our acquisitions of webhire  inc  knowledge workers inc  gantz wiley research consulting group inc  psychometric services limited  and brassring inc  in  we enhanced our talent acquisition solutions and customer base through our acquisitions of strategic outsourcing corporation and hrc human resources consulting gmbh  in  we expanded our global footprint in the talent acquisition space through our acquisition of quorum international holdings limited  and in  we entered into an ownership interest transfer agreement with shanghai runjie management consulting company to gain presence in china s human capital management market 
as a result of our shift in strategic focus in  we have focused on providing talent acquisition and employee performance management solutions on a subscription basis and currently generate a significant portion of our revenue from these subscriptions 
we generate the remainder of our revenue from discrete professional services that are not provided as part of an integrated solution on a subscription basis 
subscription based solutions provide us with a recurring revenue stream and we believe represent a more compelling opportunity in terms of growth and profitability than discrete professional services 
in  revenue derived from subscriptions for these solutions comprised approximately of our total revenue 
since  subscription revenue has represented approximately of our total revenue 
for the years ended december and subscription revenue represented approximately and of our total revenue  respectively 
this shift to subscription based services has been driven by our customer s adoption of the on demand model for software delivery and need for solutions that improve employee recruiting and retention  we expect that trend to continue 
from our inception through  our operations were funded primarily through internally generated cash flows and our line of credit  as well as private placements of our securities to institutional investors 
on june   we completed our initial public offering and listed our common stock for trading on the nasdaq stock market 
recent events during the fourth quarter  in response to the challenging macroeconomic environment  the strengthening us dollar relative to other currencies of countries in which we do business  and the slowing or delaying of a number of projects by our customers  we announced a restructuring program involving reductions of approximately employees and recorded severance and outplacement benefit costs totaling million 
during the first quarter of  as a result of the continued deterioration in the economic environment  we executed an additional reduction of approximately employees and recorded severance and outplacement benefit costs totaling million 
during the three months ended march  and december   due to a and  respectively  decline in our stock price and market capitalization from the previous quarter  lower projected net income  cash flow estimates and slower projected growth rates in our industry  we reevaluated our goodwill impairment analysis 
our analysis was performed to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill with neither the write up nor write down of any assets or liabilities  nor recording of any additional unrecognized identifiable intangible assets 
based upon our analysis we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million and million during the three months ended march  and december   respectively 
this goodwill impairment charge had no effect on our cash balances 
on january   we entered into an ownership interest transfer agreement with shanghai runjie management consulting company  r and j in shanghai  china for million 
the initial investment provided us with a ownership in the new entity shanghai kenexa human resources consulting co  ltd  the variable interest entity and a presence in china s human capital management market 
the agreement with r and j also provided for a annual ownership increase based upon adjusted ebitda  as defined  for each of the years ended  and in the third and fourth quarter of  based upon the operating results for r and j  we paid an additional million for an additional ownership interest in the variable interest entity 
the variable interest entity was financed with million in initial equity contributions from us and r and j  and has no borrowings for which its assets would be used as collateral 
on september  we provided million of financing for the variable interest entity 
the creditors of the variable interest entity do not have recourse to our other assets 
on may   we elected not to renew our secured credit agreement with pnc bank 
we believe that our cash  short term investments  ubs settlement agreement for our auction rate securities and projected cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
on june  and july   two putative class actions were filed against kenexa corporation and our chief executive officer and chief financial officer in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania  purportedly on behalf of a class of our investors who purchased our publicly traded securities between may  and november  the complaint filed on july  has since been voluntarily dismissed 
in the pending action  building trades united pension trust fund  individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated alleges violations of section b of the securities exchange act of exchange act  rule b promulgated thereunder and section a of the exchange act in connection with various public statements made by kenexa 
this action seeks unspecified damages  attorneys fees and expenses 
sources of revenue we derive revenue primarily from two sources subscription revenue for our solutions  which is comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand software  consulting services  outsourcing services and proprietary content  and from customers purchasing additional support that is not included in the basic subscription fee  and fees for discrete professional services 
our customers primarily purchase renewable subscriptions for our solutions 
the typical term is one to three years  with some terms extending up to five years 
the majority of our subscription agreements are not cancelable for convenience although our customers have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we fail to provide the agreed upon services or otherwise breach the agreement 
a customer does not generally have a right to a refund of any advance payments if the contract is cancelled 
due to the current economic slowdown  a greater number of our customers are delaying or seeking to revise the terms and conditions of our service agreements 
as a result  during the year ended december  our customers renewed approximately of the aggregate value of multi year subscriptions for our on demand talent acquisition and performance management solution contracts subject to renewal during the period rather than our historical renewal rate of approximately 
as the business environment improves we expect renewal rates to improve to the range from a long term perspective 
consistent with our historical practices  revenue derived from subscription fees is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription agreement 
we generally invoice our customers in advance in quarterly installments and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within days of invoice 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable prior to the receipt of payment and in deferred revenue to the extent revenue recognition criteria have not been met 
as of december   deferred revenue increased by million or to million from million at december  the increase in deferred revenue is a result of the increase in sales of our multiple elements or bundled arrangements 
we generally price our solutions based on the number of software applications and services included and the number of customer employees 
accordingly  subscription fees are generally greater for larger organizations and for those that subscribe for a broader array of software applications and services 
we derive other revenue from the sale of discrete professional services  and translation services as well as from out of pocket expenses 
the majority of our other revenue is derived from discrete professional services  which primarily consist of consulting and training services 
this revenue is recognized differently depending on the type of service provided as described in greater detail below under critical accounting policies and estimates 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenue was derived from sales in the united states 
revenue that we generated from customers in the united kingdom and germany was approximately and  respectively  for the year ended december  revenue for other countries amounted to an aggregate of 
other than the countries listed  no other country represented more than of our total revenue for the year ended december  the increase in our percentage revenue derived from sales in the united states is primarily due to decreased foreign sales 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue primarily consists of compensation  employee benefits and out of pocket travel related expenses for our employees and independent contractors who provide consulting or other professional services to our customers 
additionally  our application hosting costs  amortization of third party license royalty costs  technical support personnel costs  overhead allocated based on headcount and reimbursed expenses are also recorded as cost of revenue 
many factors affect our cost of revenue  including changes in the mix of products and services  pricing trends  changes in the amount of reimbursed expenses and fluctuations in our customer base 
because cost as a percentage of revenue is higher for professional services than for software products  an increase in the services component of our solutions or an increase in discrete professional services as a percentage of our total revenue would reduce gross profit as a percentage of total revenue 
as our revenues begin to increase  we expect our cost of revenue to increase proportionately  subject to pricing pressure related to economic conditions and slightly influenced by the mix of services and software 
to the extent new customers are added  we expect that the cost of services  as a percentage of revenue  will be greater than those services associated with existing customers operating expenses we classify our operating expenses as follows sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for employees engaged in sales and marketing  including salaries  commissions  and other variable compensation  travel expenses and costs associated with trade shows  advertising and other marketing efforts and allocated overhead 
we expense our sales commissions at the time the related revenue is recognized  and we recognize revenue from our subscription agreements ratably over the terms of the agreements 
over the past several years  our sales and marketing expense has increased in absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenue 
although we believe that our investment in sales and marketing commencing in resulted in significant revenue growth during through  based on recent economic conditions we have reduced our sales and marketing expenditures to adjust for expected lower rates of growth projections 
consistent with our past practice  we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to pursue new customers and expand relationships with existing customers at levels we deem appropriate given our current economic conditions 
we expect our sales and marketing expense to increase from current levels  mainly due to increased staff expense and continued emphasis on our rebranding effort 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for our executive  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the short term as we incur additional professional fees in connection with our patent infringement matter  however  in the longer term based upon the current state of the economy  we believe that general and administrative expenses will remain the same or slightly decrease in dollar amount and remain constant as a percentage of total revenue in research and development 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs  including salaries  and employee benefits  for software engineers  quality assurance engineers  product managers  technical sales engineers and management information systems personnel and third party consultants 
our research and development efforts have been devoted primarily to new product offerings and enhancements and upgrades to our existing products 
we believe that research and development expenses will increase in dollar amount in key performance indicators the following tables summarize the key performance indicators that we consider to be material in managing our business  in thousands other than percentages for the year ended december  total revenue subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue non gaap income from operations net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  deferred revenue the following is a discussion of significant terms used in the tables above 
subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue can be derived from our consolidated statements of operations 
this performance indicator illustrates the evolution of our business towards subscription based solutions  which provides us with a recurring revenue stream and which we believe to be a more compelling revenue growth and profitability opportunity 
we expect that the percentage of subscription revenue will be within a target range of to of our total revenues in non gaap income from operations 
non gaap income from operations is derived from income loss from operations adjusted for noncash or nonrecurring expenses 
we believe that measuring our operations  using non gaap income from operations provides more useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and ongoing results 
we use these measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses  for purposes of determining executive incentive compensation  and for budget and planning purposes 
these measures are used in monthly financial reports prepared for management and in quarterly financial reports presented to our board of directors 
we believe that the use of these non gaap financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial measures with other companies in our industry  many of which present similar non gaap financial measures to investors 
we do not consider such non gaap measures in isolation or as an alternative to such measures determined in accordance with gaap 
the principal limitation of such non gaap financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by gaap to be recorded 
in addition  they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non gaap financial measures 
in order to compensate for these limitations  we present our non gaap financial measures in connection with our gaap results 
we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below  and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
for the year ended december  unaudited unaudited unaudited income loss from operations share based compensation expense amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions professional fees associated with variable interest entity severance expense restructuring charges legal fees associated with restructure charges one time consulting fee related to r d carryback goodwill impairment charge noncontrolling interests non gaap income from operations the company s non gaap financial measures as set forth in the table above exclude the following share based compensation 
share based compensation consists of expenses for stock options and stock awards that we began recording in accordance with sfas r during the first quarter of share based compensation was million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
share based compensation expenses are excluded in our non gaap financial measures because share based compensation amounts are difficult to forecast 
this is due in part to the magnitude of the charges which depends upon the volume and timing of stock option grants  which are unpredictable and can vary dramatically from period to period  and external factors such as interest rates and the trading price and volatility of our common stock 
we believe that this exclusion provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results because these non gaap financial measures facilitate the comparison of results for future periods with results from past periods 
the dilutive effect of all outstanding options is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share on both a gaap and a non gaap basis 
amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions 
in accordance with gaap  operating expenses include amortization of acquired intangible assets which are amortized over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets was million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded from our non gaap financial measures because we believe that such exclusion facilitates comparisons to its historical operating results and to the results of other companies in the same industry  which have their own unique acquisition histories 
professional fees related to our chinese expansion 
the company incurred professional fees in connection with its chinese expansion in the amount of million during the first quarter of the company believes that such exclusion facilitates comparisons to its historical operating results and to the results of other companies in the same industry  which have their own unique acquisition histories 
severance expenses 
we incurred charges in the amount of million in relation to additional severance expenses in the first quarter of these charges were excluded them from its non gaap income to facilitate a more meaningful comparison to the prior year s results 
expenses related to restructuring charges and related legal fees 
we incurred charges in the amount of million in relation to the restructuring in the fourth quarter of such charges consisted of severance and outplacement benefit costs of million and certain legal fees of million in relation to the termination of approximately employees 
research and development r d credits and the related consulting fees incurred to identify those credits 
r d credits in relate to r d activities performed during the entire year of  and reduce the company s tax expense 
these tax credits totaling million were claimed in the company s fourth quarter tax filing and are reflected in the company s december  financial statements 
the r d tax credit is excluded from the company s non gaap financial measures in the current quarter to facilitate a more meaningful comparison to the prior year s results 
goodwill impairment charge 
we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of of million and million in the fourth quarter of of as a result of a substantial decrease in our stock price  reflecting the impact of the unprecedented turmoil in world economies and the resultant impact on our operations 
noncontrolling interest 
non controlling interest of million includes income from operations due to our variable interest entity partner and is excluded from the calculation of non gaap net income from operations because it is unrelated to our ownership in the venture 
net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities is taken from our consolidated statement of cash flows and represents the amount of cash generated by our operations that is available for investing and financing activities 
generally  our net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded our operating income primarily due to the positive impact of deferred revenue  the add back of non cash goodwill impairment charges and more recently due to the collection of accounts receivables 
it is possible that this trend may vary as business conditions change 
deferred revenue 
we generate revenue primarily from multi year subscriptions for our on demand talent acquisition and employee performance management solutions 
we recognize revenue from these subscription agreements ratably over the hosting period  which is typically one to three years 
we generally invoice our customers in quarterly or monthly installments in advance 
deferred revenue  which is included in our consolidated balance sheets  is the amount of invoiced subscriptions in excess of the amount recognized as revenue 
deferred revenue represents  in part  the amount that we will record as revenue in our consolidated statements of operations in future periods 
as the subscription component of our revenue has grown and customer willingness to pay us in advance for their subscriptions has increased  the amount of deferred revenue on our balance sheet has grown 
it is possible that this trend may vary as business conditions change 
the following table reconciles beginning and ending deferred revenue for each of the periods shown for the year ended december  in thousands deferred revenue at the beginning of the year total invoiced subscriptions during the year deferred revenue from acquisition subscription revenue recognized during the year deferred revenue at end of year critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable and accrued expenses 
we base these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we derive our revenue from two sources subscription revenues for solutions  which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand software  consulting services  outsourcing services and proprietary content  and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee  and other fees for professional services  translation services and reimbursed out of pocket expenses 
because we provide our solutions as a service  we follow the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb asc  revenue recognition and fasb asc multiple element arrangements 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of the fees is probable  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
subscription fees and support revenues 
subscription fees and support revenues are recognized ratably over the lives of the contracts 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
other revenue 
other revenue consists of discrete professional services  translation services and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
discrete professional services  when sold with subscription and support offerings  are accounted for separately since these services have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the delivered elements 
our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 
additionally  when professional services are sold with other elements  the consideration from the revenue arrangement is allocated among the separate elements based upon the relative fair value 
revenues from professional services are recognized based upon proportional performance as value is delivered to the customer 
in determining whether revenues from professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription revenue  we consider the following factors for each agreement availability of professional services from other vendors  whether objective and reliable evidence of the fair value exists of the undelivered elements  the nature and the timing of when the agreement was signed in comparison to the subscription agreement start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer s satisfaction with the other services 
if the professional service does not qualify for separate accounting  we recognize the revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract 
in these situations we defer the direct and incremental costs of the professional service over the same period as the revenue is recognized 
in accordance with fasb asc  principal agent considerations  we record reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses as revenue and not netted with the applicable costs 
these items primarily include travel  meals and certain telecommunication costs 
reimbursed expenses for the years ended december    and  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers inability to pay us 
the provision is based on our historical experience and for specific customers that  in our opinion  are likely to default on our receivables from them 
in order to identify these customers  we perform ongoing reviews of all customers that have breached their payment terms  as well as those that have filed for bankruptcy or for whom information has become available indicating a significant risk of non recoverability 
we rely on historical trends of bad debt as a percentage of total revenue and apply these percentages to the accounts receivable associated with new customers and evaluate these customers over time 
to the extent that our future collections differ from our assumptions based on historical experience  the amount of our bad debt and allowance recorded may be different 
self insurance we are self insured for the majority of our health insurance costs  including claims filed and claims incurred but not reported subject to certain stop loss provisions 
we estimate our liability based upon management s judgment and historical experience 
we also rely on the advice of consulting administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
self insurance accruals totaled approximately million as of and for the periods ended december  and we continuously review the adequacy of our insurance coverage 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of insurance expense if actual experience differs significantly from management s estimates 
capitalized software development costs in accordance with fasb asc  software  and fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other  costs incurred in the preliminary stages of a development project are expensed as incurred 
once an application has reached the development stage  internal and external costs  if direct and incremental  will be capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing 
we also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality 
maintenance and training cost are expensed as incurred 
internal use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life  generally three years 
management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 
there were no impairments to internal software in any of the periods covered in this report 
goodwill and other identified intangible asset impairment since  we have recorded goodwill in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other  which requires us to annually review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment 
if goodwill becomes impaired  some or all of the goodwill would be written off as a charge to operations 
this comparison is performed annually or more frequently if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
during the quarter ended december  we reevaluated our goodwill  due to adverse changes in the economic climate  a decline in our market capitalization from october  our annual testing date  and a downward revision in our earnings guidance for the quarter and year ended december  these factors signaled a triggering event  which required us to determine whether and to what extent our goodwill may have been impaired as of december  the first step of this analysis requires the estimation of our fair value  as an entity  and is calculated based on the observable market capitalization with a range of estimated control premiums as well as discounted future estimated cash flows 
this step yielded an estimated fair value for us which was less than our carrying value including goodwill at december  the next step entails performing an analysis to determine whether the carrying amount of goodwill on our balance sheet exceeds our implied fair value 
the implied fair value of our goodwill  for this step was determined in the same manner as goodwill recognized in a business combination 
our estimated fair value was allocated to our assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized identifiable intangible assets  as if we had been acquired in a business combination with our estimated fair value representing the price paid to acquire it 
the allocation process performed on the test date was only for purposes of determining the implied fair value of goodwill with neither the write up or write down of any assets or liabilities  nor recording any additional unrecognized identifiable intangible assets as part of this process as of december  based on the analysis  we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill was million  resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of million 
the goodwill impairment charge had no effect on our cash balances 
during the quarter ended march  we reevaluated our goodwill due to continued adverse changes in the economic climate  a decline in our market capitalization from december  through march  and a downward revision in internal projections 
these factors signaled a triggering event  which required us to determine whether and to what extent our goodwill may have been impaired as of march  the allocation process performed on the test date was only for purposes of determining the implied fair value of goodwill with no assets or liabilities written up or down  nor any additional unrecognized identifiable intangible assets recorded as part of this process 
based on the analysis  a goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded to write off the remaining balance of our goodwill for the quarter ended march  the goodwill impairment charge had no effect on the company s cash balances classification and fair value measurement of auction rate securities we hold investments in auction rate securities having contractual maturities of greater than one year and interest rate reset features of between and days 
these auction rate securities were priced and initially traded as short term investments because of the interest rate reset feature 
during  as a result of the deterioration in the credit markets  our auction rate securities failed to trade at auctions due to insufficient bids from buyers 
the credit market crisis led to uncertainty surrounding the liquidity of our auction rate security investments and required us to reclassify our auction rate securities to long term investments 
in june  due to our ability to liquidate these securities within the next twelve months  we reclassified our auction rate securities to short term investments on our consolidated balance sheet 
our auction rate securities  which have a par value of million at december   were acquired through ubs ag 
due to the failure of the auction rate market in early  ubs ag and other major banks entered into discussions with government agencies to provide liquidity to owners of auction rate securities 
in november  we entered into an agreement the ubs settlement agreement with ubs ag which provides us with a no net cost loan up to the par value of eligible ars until june   the right to sell these auction rate securities back to ubs ag at par  at our sole discretion  anytime during the period from june  through july   and ubs ag the right to purchase these auction rate securities or sell them on our behalf at par anytime through july  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
following the execution of the ubs settlement agreement  we determined that we no longer had the intent to hold the ars until either maturity or recovery of the ars market 
based on this unusual circumstance related to the signing of the ubs settlement agreement  we transferred these investments from available for sale to trading securities and began recording the change in fair value of the ars as gains or losses in current period earnings 
contemporaneous with the determination to transfer the ars to trading securities  we elected to measure the value of our option to put the securities put option to ubs ag under the fair value option of fasb asc  financial instruments 
as a result  at december   we recorded a non operating gain representing the estimated fair value of the put option and a corresponding long term asset of approximately million 
at december   the put option s estimated fair value decreased to million resulting in a non operating loss of million for the twelve months ended december  the estimated fair value of the put option as of december  was based in part on an expected life of six months and a discount rate of 
in june  due to our ability to exercise our put option within the next twelve months  we reclassified our put option to other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of the transfer of the ars from available for sale to trading investment securities noted above  we also recorded a non operating gain for the twelve months ended december  of approximately million 
the recording of the loss relating to the decrease in the fair value of the put option and the recognition of the gain in the ars resulted in an overall net loss of less than million for the year ended december  we anticipate that any future changes in the fair value of our put option under the ubs settlement agreement will partially be offset by the changes in the fair value of the related auction rate securities 
our option to put the securities under the ubs settlement agreement will continue to be measured at fair value utilizing level inputs as defined by fasb asc  fair value measurement and disclosure  until the earlier of its maturity or exercise 
the fair values of our auction rate securities are estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis or other types of valuation models as of december  rather than at par 
these analyses are highly judgmental and consider  among other items  the likelihood of redemption  credit quality  duration  insurance wraps and expected future cash flows 
these securities are also compared  when possible  to other observable market data with similar characteristics to the securities held by us 
any changes in fair value for our auction rate securities  which we attribute to market liquidity issues rather than credit issues  are recorded in our statement of operations 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign countries 
we record an income tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of operating results reportable to each taxing jurisdiction in compliance with enacted tax legislation 
we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
asc also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realization of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we have used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in each jurisdiction 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
our determination of the level of valuation allowance at december  is based on an estimated forecast of future taxable income which includes many judgments and assumptions primarily related to revenue  margins  operating expenses  tax planning strategies and tax attributes in multiple taxing jurisdictions 
accordingly  it is at least reasonably possible that future changes in one or more of these assumptions may lead to a change in judgment regarding the level of valuation allowance required in future periods 
accounting for share based compensation share based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the number of awards that are expected to vest multiplied by the fair value 
we use a black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of our share based awards 
the calculation of the fair value of the awards using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following volatility is a measure of the amount by which the stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected life of the award and is based on a weighted average of peer companies  comparable indices and our stock volatility 
an increase in the volatility would result in an increase in our expense 
the expected term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding and is currently based upon an average of the contractual life and the vesting period of the options 
with the passage of time actual behavioral patterns surrounding the expected term will replace the current methodology 
changes in the future exercise behavior of employees or in the vesting period of the award could result in a change in the expected term 
an increase in the expected term would result in an increase to our expense 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at time of grant 
an increase in the risk free interest rate would result in an increase in our expense 
the estimated forfeiture rate is the rate at which awards are expected to expire before they become fully vested and exercisable 
an increase in the forfeiture rate would result in a decrease to our expense 
in certain instances where market based  performance share awards are granted  we use the monte carlo valuation model to calculate the fair value 
this approach utilizes a two stage process  which first simulates potential outcomes for our shares using the monte carlo simulation 
the first stage of the monte carlo simulation requires a variety of assumptions about both the statistical properties of our shares as well as potential reactions to such share price movements by our management 
such assumptions include the natural logarithm of our stock price  a random log difference using the russell stock index and a random variable using the specific deviations of our returns relative to the returns dictated by the capm model 
the second stage employs the black scholes model to value the various outcomes predicted by the monte carlo simulation 
the resulting fair value  on the date of the grant measurement date  is being recognized over the vesting period using the straight line method

based upon the current market conditions  we expect our subscription based and other revenues to increase in over the prior year due to stabilization in the unemployment rate  slightly improved business environment and continued acceptance of our talent management solutions on demand model 
cost of revenues cost of revenue decreased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  due to decreased revenues in the million decrease in the cost of revenue was primarily due to reduced staff expense  reimbursable expense and third party fees  including marketing and agency costs  of approximately million  million and million  respectively  compared to the same period in many factors affect our cost of revenue  including changes in the mix of products and services  the number of initial implementations versus recurring engagements  pricing trends  changes in the amount of reimbursed expenses and fluctuations in our customer base 
as our overall revenue increases  we expect our cost of revenue will increase proportionately  subject to pricing pressure related to economic conditions and slightly influenced by the mix of services and software 
to the extent new customers are added  we expect that the cost of services  as a percentage of revenue  will be greater than those services associated with existing customers 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense decreased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease was primarily due to reduced staff related expense  commissions  travel expenses and reserve for bad debt of approximately million  million  million  and million  respectively  partially offset by an increase in other expenses of million  compared to the same period in as a percentage of total revenue  sales and marketing expense increased by to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due to decreased revenue 
consistent with our past practice  we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to pursue new customers and expand relationships with existing customers at levels we deem appropriate given our current economic conditions 
we expect our sales and marketing expense to increase from current levels  mainly due to increased staff expense  including variable compensation and continued emphasis on our rebranding effort 
general and administrative general and administrative expense decreased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease was primarily due to reduced staff related expense  bonus  share based compensation and travel expenses of approximately million  million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  phone  entertainment and infrastructure expenses such as supplies  insurance and other expenses contributed approximately million  million  and million  respectively  of the decrease in expense compared to the same period in as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expense increased by to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  due to decreased revenues in in the short term  we expect general and administrative expense to increase as we incur additional professional fees in connection with our patent infringement matter  however  in the longer term based upon the current state of the economy  we believe that general and administrative expenses will remain the same or slightly increase in dollar amount and remain constant as a percentage of total revenue in research and development research and development expense decreased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to reduced staff related expense and an increase in capitalized software development costs 
capitalized software development costs increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in capitalized software development costs was directly attributable to an increase in the software development projects qualifying for capitalization  pursuant to asc  internal use software  and a decrease of research and development expenses 
the increase in capitalized software development costs was due in part to greater use of third party software developers 
as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expense decreased to for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  a small portion of our research and development expense relates to the efforts of our kenexa research institute scientists  which is more fixed in nature 
this cost structure will result in future research and development expense being more constant 
we expect research and development expenses to remain flat or increase slightly as we continue to execute on our strategies which include furthering the common services enterprise architecture  introducing kenexa x modules  and continuing to develop feature enhancements 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was due in part to increased amortization expense associated with our acquisitions and increased depreciation expense associated with our capitalized software and our capital purchases including our building in vizag 
in the future  we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase as we place our software development into service and due to recent capital purchases 
goodwill impairment during the quarter ended march  we reevaluated our goodwill due to continued adverse changes in the economic climate  a decline in our market capitalization from december  through march  and a downward revision in internal projections 
these factors signaled a triggering event  which required us to determine whether and to what extent our goodwill may have been impaired as of march  we reviewed our goodwill by comparing the carrying values to the estimated fair values of the enterprise 
fair value is based on our estimate of the future discounted cash flows to be generated by the enterprise and our market capitalization 
such cash flows consider factors such as future operating income  historical trends  as well as demand and competition 
comparable company multiples are based upon public companies in sectors relevant to our business based on our knowledge of the industry 
changes in the underlying business could affect these estimates  which in turn could affect our assessment of the recoverability of goodwill 
based on the analysis a goodwill impairment charge of million for was recorded to write off the remaining balance of our goodwill for the quarter ended march  
the goodwill impairment charge had no effect on our cash balances 
see critical accounting policies and estimates for additional details 
interest income net interest expense was less than million for the year ended december  compared to million net interest income for the year ended december  the million decrease is due primarily to significantly lower rates of interest in and and the write off of deferred financing fees as a result of the termination of our credit agreement with pnc bank 
income tax expense an income tax expense of million was recorded on a loss from operations of for the year ended december  as compared with an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the current year income tax expense is primarily attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance of million on federal  state and foreign net operating losses and the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss of million that is only partially deductible for us tax purposes 
webhire and brassring were two domestic companies which we acquired in during the year ended december   webhire and brassring each made retroactive elections under section g of the internal revenue code with the effect of increasing the tax basis of certain acquired intangible assets to equal the deemed purchase price of these assets 
we are amortizing the increased tax basis of these acquired intangibles over a year period for federal and state income tax purposes 
the amortization of these intangibles gives rise to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of these assets 
the goodwill impairment loss claimed in included certain intangible assets recorded by webhire and brassring during their respective acquisitions 
these intangibles are characterized as component goodwill as we expect to recognize tax deductions as we amortize the tax basis of these assets over their remaining useful lives 
the portion of impaired goodwill that has no tax basis is considered to be component goodwill 
we have allocated the impairment charge of million between component goodwill million and component goodwill million and recorded a deferred tax asset computed on the difference between the book and tax bases of component goodwill 
changes to deferred income taxes are generally based on management s evaluation of our positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets and the determination that it is more likely than not that we will realize a portion of the benefits of federal and state tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  management considers all available information within each taxing jurisdiction  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
any changes in management s assessment of the amount of deferred tax assets that may be realized will result in an adjustment to its valuation allowance with a corresponding increase or decrease to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues total revenue increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our subscription revenue increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  subscription revenue represented approximately of our total revenue for the year ended december  compared to of our total revenue for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is attributable primarily to an increase in sales volumes of our talent management solutions and the continued acceptance of our on demand model 
revenue generated by quorum comprised approximately of the increase in our total revenue for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
our other revenue increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was mostly due to an increase in demand for our consulting services which resulted from an increase in our subscription based revenues 
cost of revenues cost of revenue increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million increase in the cost of revenue was primarily due to increased salaries  overhead  direct costs and other expense of million  million  million and million  respectively 
our increased salaries were due in part to the addition of employees from the acquisition of quorum in sales and marketing sales and marketing expense increased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was due in part to an increase of staff related expense of approximately million  partially offset by a decrease in performance bonuses  commissions and travel expenses of approximately million from the prior year 
the net million increase in salaries was due partially to the addition of employees from our quorum acquisition and employees hired for our existing business in in addition  reserve for bad debt and advertising and marketing expense contributed approximately million and million to the increase in sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  over the prior year 
the increase in bad debt was mainly attributed to three customers 
as a percentage of total revenue  s m expense increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due to increased expense 
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was due in part to an increase in professional fees  rent and utilities expense  and share based compensation expense which contributed million  million  and million  respectively  to the increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
in addition increased travel  phone and license expense contributed approximately million  million and million in expense for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the remainder of the increase of million was attributable to increases in infrastructure expenses such as supplies  insurance and other expenses of million and salary and bonus expenses of million 
as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expense increased by to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  research and development research and development expense decreased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million decrease in research and development expense was directly attributable to increased capitalized software development costs during capitalized software development costs increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in capitalized software development costs represents and of research and development expense for the years ended december  and  respectively and was directly attributable to an increase in the software development projects qualifying for capitalization  pursuant to asc  internal use software 
this increase was due in part to greater use of third party software developers 
as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expense decreased from to for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to increased capitalized software development costs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was due in part to increased amortization expense associated with our recent acquisitions and increased depreciation expense associated with our capitalized software and our capital purchases including our building in vizag 
restructuring expense during the quarter ended december  in response to the weakness of our macroeconomic environment and widespread deterioration in our business climate we announced a restructuring program involving staff reductions of approximately employees which included severance and outplacement benefit costs totaling approximately million 
goodwill impairment during the quarter ended december   due to adverse changes in the economic climate  a decline in the our market capitalization from october   and a downward revision in our earnings guidance for the quarter and year ended december   we reevaluated our goodwill impairment analysis 
pursuant to fasb asc  assets intangibles goodwill and other  these factors signaled a triggering event  which required us to determine whether and to what extent our goodwill was impaired as of december  the first step of this analysis required the estimation of our fair value  as an entity  and is calculated based on the observable market capitalization with a range of estimated control premiums as well as discounted future estimated cash flows 
this step yielded an estimated fair value for us which was less than our carrying value including goodwill at december  the next step entailed performing an analysis to determine whether the carrying amount of goodwill on our balance sheet exceeded our implied fair value 
the implied fair value of our goodwill  for this step was determined in the same manner as goodwill recognized in a business combination 
our estimated fair value was allocated to our assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized identifiable intangible assets  as if we had been acquired in a business combination with our estimated fair value representing the price paid to acquire it 
the allocation process performed on the test date was only for purposes of determining the implied fair value of goodwill with neither the write up or write down of any assets or liabilities  nor recording of any additional unrecognized identifiable intangible assets as part of this process  but did cause us to be out of compliance with the covenants under our credit facility pursuant as of december  based on the analysis  we determined that the implied fair value of the kenexa s goodwill was million  resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of million 
the goodwill impairment charge had no effect on our cash balances 
interest income interest income decreased million or for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million decrease was due primarily to lower cash balances and lower rates of interest in income tax expense an income tax benefit on continuing operations of million was recorded for the year ended december  as compared with an income tax expense of million for the year ended december  this income tax benefit was primarily attributable to the recognition of a deferred tax asset of million relating to a goodwill impairment loss that was deductible for us tax purposes 
changes to deferred income taxes are generally based on management s evaluation of our positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets and the determination that it is more likely than not that we will realize a portion of the benefits of federal and state tax assets 
webhire  which we acquired in january  had a net operating loss carryforward balance of approximately million for federal purposes as of september  brassring  which we acquired in november  had a net operating loss carryforward balance of approximately million for federal purposes as of december  based upon the uncertainty of our ability to utilize these acquired net operating losses  we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   webhire and brassring made retroactive elections under section g of the internal revenue code with the effect of increasing the tax basis of acquired intangible assets to the deemed purchase price of these assets 
we will amortize the increased tax basis of acquired intangibles over a year period for federal and state income tax purposes 
separate gains equal to the respective increases in tax basis were included in the pre acquisition taxable incomes of each acquired company 
webhire and brassring each had sufficient net operating loss carryforwards to fully offset the income recognized on the deemed sale of assets for regular federal income tax purposes 
however  under the federal alternative minimum tax rules  net operating loss carryforwards may not offset more than of income taxable under this measure 
we have therefore paid alternative minimum tax on these gains of approximately million 
concurrent with the recognition of these gains  certain of the acquired net operating losses were deemed to expire 
accordingly  we reduced the deferred tax assets associated with these acquired net operating losses and the related valuation allowances by offsetting amounts of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources since we were formed in  we have financed our operations primarily through internally generated cash flows  our revolving credit facilities and the issuance of equity 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
in addition  we had no debt and approximately million in capital equipment leases 
our cash provided from operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used in and provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
all of these effects in resulted in an increase in our cash and cash equivalents of million for the year ended december  while our investing and financing activities have been significant over the past three years  we expect positive cash flow from operations to continue in future periods 
as of december   we held auction rate securities with a fair value of million and par value of million 
our auction rate securities portfolio includes investments rated a  aa and aaa and are comprised of federally and privately insured student loans 
the auction rate securities we hold have continued to fail to trade at recent auctions due to insufficient bids from buyers 
this limits the short term liquidity of these instruments and may limit our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities if we needed to convert some or all to cash in the near term 
despite the current lack of liquidity in the auction rate security market  we believe our current cash and cash equivalent balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations 
our auction rate securities were acquired through ubs ag 
due to the failure of the auction rate market in early  ubs and other major banks entered into agreements with governmental agencies to provide liquidity to owners of auction rate securities 
in november  we entered into an agreement with ubs which provides us with a no net cost loan up to the par value of eligible ars until september   the right to sell these auction rate securities back to ubs ag at par  at our sole discretion  anytime during the period from june  through july   and provides ubs ag the right to purchase these auction rate securities or sell them on our behalf at par anytime through july  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information 
on may   we elected not to renew our secured credit agreement with our bank and as a result  no longer have a revolving credit facility or other debt financing arrangement 
we believe that our cash and short term investments  our ubs settlement agreement for our auction rate securities and our projected cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
on april   we acquired quorum international holdings limited quorum  a provider of recruitment process outsourcing services based in london  england  for a purchase price of approximately million  in cash  to broaden our presence in the global recruitment market 
the total cost of the acquisition  including legal  accounting  and other professional fees of million  was approximately million 
in addition  the acquisition agreement contains an earnout provision which provides for the payment of additional consideration by the company based upon the gross profit of quorum for the twelve month period ending june  and june  formulaically  the earnout is times quorum s gross profit less the amount of base consideration  as defined in the agreement 
based upon the results for the twelve month period through june   it was determined that an earnout payment was due to the former shareholders of quorum and as such  we accrued additional consideration of million 
the related liability has been accrued in the financial statements at december  the additional consideration was paid in cash during the first quarter of in addition  as of december   the june  earnout amount was substantially uncertain  and  as such  the estimated earn out range is not possible to disclose 
the company evaluates the earnout provisions contained in the acquisition agreement at each financial statement reporting date 
on february   our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan providing for the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock 
in connection with our november  and february  stock repurchase plans  we repurchased million and shares of our common stock at an average price of per share and an aggregate cost of million for the year ended december  for the period ended december   there were no repurchases under the stock repurchase plans 
as of december   there was  shares available for repurchase under the stock repurchase plan 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software subscriptions 
payments from customers for subscription agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contract term  which can vary from one to three years in length 
we also generate significant cash from our recruitment process outsourcing services and to a lesser extent our consulting services 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures as well as payments related to taxes and leased facilities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from a net loss of approximately million  an increase in deferred tax benefits of million and other changes in working capital of million  offset by a non cash charge to goodwill impairment of million  other non cash charges of million  accounts and unbilled receivables of million and deferred revenue of million 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from a net loss of approximately million  an increase in deferred tax benefits of million and other changes in working capital of million  partially offset by a non cash charge to goodwill impairment of million  other non cash charges of million  and deferred revenue of million 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net income of approximately million  non cash charges to net income of million  deferred revenue of million and other changes in working capital of million offset by a million reduction in taxes payable resulting from our adoption of fas r in during  we completed a restructuring plan to decrease costs by reducing our workforce across our organization and by consolidating facilities where the workforce reductions resulted in excess office space 
this restructuring plan was designed to decrease costs by reducing our workforce throughout the company of approximately employees 
we recorded restructuring and other charges and made payments of million during fiscal as a result of the continued deterioration in the economic environment during the first quarter of  we executed an additional reduction in force resulting in the elimination of approximately employees  as a result we incurred severance and outplacement benefit costs totaling million 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flows used in investing activities consisted primarily of adjustments for earnouts  taxes  escrow payments  acquisitions and additional capital equipment as follows years ended december  scottworks acquisition webhire acquisition knowledge workers acquisition gantz wiley research acquisition brassring acquisition psychometrics acquisition straightsource acquisition hrc acquisition quorum acquisition investment in variable interest entity cash held in escrow for acquisitions capitalized software and purchases of computer hardware purchases of available for sale securities sales of available for sale securities sales of trading securities total cash flows from investing activities financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

subscription based and other revenues decreased in over the prior year due to a greater number of customers delaying or revising the terms and conditions of our service agreements  the strengthening us dollar  the loss of rpo customers  and a loss of consulting engagements 
cost of revenues cost of revenue for the quarters presented has fluctuated between and based on the mix of sales between subscription revenue and other revenue 
cost of revenue was highest as a percentage of total revenue for the three months ended march  as our overall revenue fluctuates  we expect our cost of revenue to change proportionately  subject to pricing pressure related to economic conditions and slightly influenced by the mix of services and software 
to the extent new customers are added  the cost of services  as a percentage of revenue  will be greater than those services associated with existing customers 
sales and marketing following our acquisitions in and our rebranding initiatives in sales and marketing increased slightly from approximately to of our total revenues for those periods 
during  sales and marketing expenses increased in terms of absolute dollars as a result of increased marketing programs and variable compensation programs 
during  based on economic conditions we reduced our sales and marketing expenditures to adjust for expected lower rates of growth projections 
in the future  we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to pursue new customers  expand relationships with existing customers and market and advertise our new brand to existing and potential customers at levels we deem appropriate given our current economic conditions 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses have increased as a percentage of revenues from approximately during to through march  due to our restructuring programs which resulted in severance and outplacement benefit costs 
in absolute dollar terms over the eight quarters presented general and administrative expenses have fluctuated due to our restructuring programs and professional fees in connection with our patent infringement matter 
during the last nine months of as our revenues and corporate activities remained relatively flat  our general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues held steady at approximately 
in the longer term based upon the current state of the economy  we believe that general and administrative expenses will remain the same or slightly increase in dollar amount and remain constant or decrease as a percentage of total revenue in research and development research and development expenses have decreased as a percentage of revenues from in march  to during december  due to an increase in capitalized software development costs during and the increase capitalized software development costs was due in part to greater use of third party software developers and improved precision of their time and activity reporting 
restructuring expense during the quarter ended december  in response to the challenging macroeconomic environment  the strengthening us dollar relative to other currencies of countries in which we do business  and the resulting slowing or delaying of a number of project implementations we announced a restructuring program involving staff reductions of approximately employees which included severance and outplacement benefit costs totaling approximately million 
as a result of the continued deterioration in the economic environment during the first quarter of  we executed an additional reduction in force resulting in the elimination of approximately employees and incurring million in severance and outplacement benefit costs 
goodwill impairment during the three months ended march  and december  we reviewed the carrying values of goodwill by comparing the carrying values to the estimated fair values of the enterprise 
the fair value is based on management s estimate of the future discounted cash flows to be generated by the enterprise and our market capitalization 
such cash flows consider factors such as future operating income  historical trends  as well as demand and competition 
comparable company multiples are based upon public companies in sectors relevant to our business based on our knowledge of the industry 
changes in the underlying business could affect these estimates  which in turn could affect our assessment of the recoverability of goodwill 
due to adverse changes in the economic climate  a decline in our market capitalization from october   and a downward revision in earnings guidance  we reevaluated our goodwill impairment analysis 
based on the analysis  a goodwill impairment charge of million and million for the three months ended march  and december   respectively  was recorded 
the goodwill impairment charge had no effect on our cash balances 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total the amounts listed above for capital lease obligations represent payments that we are required to make for equipment 
if we fail to remain current with our obligations for any of these capital leases  we would be in default  and our continued failure to cure such a default would cause our remaining obligations under the defaulted capital lease to become immediately due 
the amounts listed above for operating leases represent our leases for office space  copiers and other operating obligations 
if we fail to make rent payments on any of these operating leases when due  we will be required to pay all remaining rent payments on the leases 
we had no off balance sheet arrangements for the periods presented in this annual report on form k 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements effective july   we adopted the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
this standard establishes only two levels of gaap  authoritative and non authoritative 
the fasb accounting standards codification the codification became the source of authoritative  non governmental gaap  except for rules and interpretive releases of the sec  which are sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became non authoritative 
we began using the new guidelines and numbering system prescribed by the codification when referring to gaap in the third quarter of fiscal as the codification was not intended to change or alter existing gaap  it did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb adopted codification topic  subsequent events  which codifies the guidance regarding the disclosure of events subsequent to the balance sheet date 
the statement established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
asc is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june   and shall be applied prospectively 
the adoption asc did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued asc business combinations  which amends asc by establishing a model to account for certain pre acquisition contingencies 
under asc  an acquirer is required to recognize at fair value an asset acquired or a liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period

new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  which eliminates the use of the residual method for allocating consideration  as well as the criteria that requires objective and reliable evidence of fair value of undelivered elements in order to separate the elements in a multiple element arrangement 
by removing the criterion requiring the use of objective and reliable evidence of fair value in separately accounting for deliverables  the recognition of revenue will more closely align with certain revenue arrangements 
the standard also will replace the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant

the new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods that begin after november  and applies to all existing and new vies 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance 
this guidance was codified in december under asu item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk in  approximately of our total revenue was comprised of sales to customers in the united states 
a key component of our business strategy is to expand our international sales efforts  which will expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
a increase in the value of the us dollar during  relative to each of our non us generated sales would have resulted in reduced annual revenues of less than for the year ended december  the financial position and operating results of our foreign operations are consolidated using the local currency as the functional currency 
local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange to the us dollar on the balance sheet date  and the local currency revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange to the us dollar during the period 
the related translation adjustments to shareholders equity were a decrease of million and million during and  respectively  and are included in other comprehensive income loss 
the foreign currency translation adjustment is not adjusted for income taxes as it relates to an indefinite investment in a non us subsidiary 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
our cash equivalents  which consist solely of money market funds  are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on these funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we believe that a change in interest rates would not have had a significant effect on our interest income for the year ended december
