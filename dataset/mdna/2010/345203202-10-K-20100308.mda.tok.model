foreign military sales foreign military sales program 
the us department of defense foreign military sales program manages government to government purchases of weapons and other defense articles  defense services  and military training where the us department of defense serves as an intermediary  usually handling procurement  logistics and delivery with foreign militaries

table of contents vehicle deliveries and backlog see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in part ii of this annual report on form k for the quantity of vehicle deliveries and backlog as of december   and our backlog is funded backlog  meaning that it reflects vehicles for which we have received orders and for which funding has been appropriated and authorized for expenditure by the applicable agency 
regulatory environment government contracts and regulation we are a us department of defense contractor that delivers products and services to the us military 
the us government contracting process differs in many ways from commercial contracting  and involves a high degree of federal government regulation and oversight of the programs in which we participate 
as a result  we are subject to extensive regulations and requirements of the us government agencies and entities that govern these programs  including award  administration and performance of contracts 
we are also subject to certain unique business risks associated with the us government program funding and appropriations for government contracts as well as termination of the contracts at the election of the government 
in addition  us government contractors that perform military programs are also subject to audits and investigations by us government agencies such as the defense contract management agency dcma  the defense contract audit agency dcaa  the us department of defense inspector general  and other government entities 
us government agencies review a contractor s performance under its contracts  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
these entities also review the adequacy of compliance with internal control systems and policies  including the contractor s purchasing  property  accounting  estimating  compensation and management information systems  as well as possible instances of fraud  waste  and abuse 
in march  the defense contract audit agency audited our financial condition and capability and advised us that we had an acceptable rating 
this rating means that the defense contract audit agency has determined that we currently  and for the near term  have adequate financial resources to perform us government contracts 
many of our contracts are issued as orders on a sole source basis and or a not to exceed amount and then become fixed price contracts 
under fixed price contracts  the contractor agrees to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed price 
as a result  the contractor benefits from any cost savings but suffers from any losses from any cost overruns 
many of our contracts are and have been subject to definitization  meaning that the contract price is not agreed upon at contract inception 
instead  following the award of the contract  we and the us government seek to agree upon a contract price based upon our cost of performing the contract 
during the definitization process  we are required to perform the contract work  make deliveries and receive payments from the us military before the final contract price has been established 
for this reason  as part of the original award  we agree to a not to exceed price to be used for invoicing and accounting purposes pending definitization 
following an award of these orders  we are obligated to perform the work subject to any funding limitations and the not to exceed amount while we and the government negotiate a final contract price for the scope of the work to be completed 
as a result  at the completion of the contract  we may have received overpayments during the course of the contract and will be required to return any overpayments to the us military 
in addition  we also hold indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity contracts 
essentially  indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity contracts are umbrella contracts setting forth the basic terms and conditions under which the agency may order goods from a contractor  and in some cases  multiple contractors 

table of contents contractors undergo a competitive pre selection process to become eligible to receive orders under indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity contracts 
many orders under these indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity contracts are also subject to the definitization process 
in addition  indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity contracts do not obligate the federal government to purchase goods above the minimum levels set forth in the contract 
certain laws and regulations affecting our business there are certain federal laws that  while not specifically directed at us as a contractor  may affect our us government contracts 
the anti deficiency act is a collection of laws through which congress exercises its constitutional control of the public purse and prohibits involving the government in any obligation to pay money before funds have been appropriated for that purpose 
the central provision prohibits making or authorizing an expenditure from  or creating or authorizing an obligation under  any appropriation or fund in excess of the amount available in the appropriation or fund unless authorized by law 
there are also numerous provisions within the federal acquisition regulation  or far  that affect the procurement process and administration of our contracts 
with respect to conducting procurement  the far provides guidance on how the agency is to conduct the evaluation of a request for proposal 
the far also provides a mechanism through which disappointed bidders and contractors excluded from competing for government contracts and task or delivery orders may submit an objection  called a bid protest  in accordance with the relevant rules and regulations 
another area covered by the far is an organizational conflict of interest 
these regulations establish rules for avoiding  mitigating and neutralizing conflicts of interest in the issuance and performance of contracts by the federal government 
both contractors and contracting officers bear the burden of identifying and reporting organizational conflict of interest 
some contracts may be subject to the truth in negotiations act  referred to as tina  cost accounting standards and contract cost principles and procedures 
generally  tina requires us to provide cost or pricing data and to certify that those data are current  accurate and complete  in connection with the negotiation of certain types of contracts  modifications or orders  but there are some exceptions to tina  including contracts that are based on adequate price competition 
the cost accounting standards apply to contracts awarded to us after may  the cost principles set forth the rules regarding the allocability and allowability of costs incurred in connection with federal government contracts 
our conduct and performance is also subject to the false claims act and other anti fraud statutes 
the false claims act prohibits contractors from knowingly submitting false or fraudulent claims for money eg  a false or fraudulent invoice to the federal government 
laws and regulations affecting international activities federal laws affect our ability to sell our products abroad and grant access to our technology to foreign nationals in the us we are obligated to comply with a variety of federal  state and local regulations  both domestically and abroad  governing certain aspects of our international sales and support  including regulations promulgated by  among others  the us departments of commerce  defense  state and justice and the bureau of alcohol  tobacco  firearms and explosives 
these laws and regulations impose compliance and licensing obligations to obtain us government authorization for transfers outside the us and to persons in the us other than us citizens and us permanent residents 
the foreign corrupt practices act  referred to as the fcpa  and equivalent laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions prohibit improper payments to foreign governments and their officials by us and other business entities 
the fcpa has two principal parts anti bribery and record keeping provisions 
the us department of justice enforces the anti bribery provisions  the securities and 
table of contents exchange commission also has jurisdiction over civil enforcement of the anti bribery provisions 
the record keeping requirement obligates companies to maintain accurate books and records and internal financial controls regarding all transactions 
the securities and exchange commission oversees enforcement of these provisions 
intellectual property intellectual property rights  which apply to various force protection products and technologies  include patents  copyrights  trade secrets and trademarks 
we seek to remain competitive in the market by placing emphasis on research and development and are committed to capturing  protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights 
we continue to review our practices and procedures to ensure the protection of our intellectual property 
we are a party to two long term intellectual property agreements pursuant to which we have the right to use certain intellectual property technology relating to blast and ballistic protected vehicles

the other is with mechem  a division of denel pty ltd  a company established under the laws of the republic of south africa mechem 
under these agreements  we pay a per vehicle royalty fee in exchange for the exclusive transfer to us of certain technology regarding the buffalo and cougar 
in connection with our subcontract with bae systems  we entered into a production license agreement with bae systems  dated june   pursuant to which we license to bae systems the use of our cougar vehicle as the basis for the ilav vehicle design  and act as bae systems principal subcontractor to provide the manpower and other resources needed to produce of the vehicles in ladson  south carolina 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we receive a license fee for each ilav vehicle manufactured by bae systems under the agreement 
the production license agreement will remain in effect until the earlier of i completion of all the work under the bae agreement  ii termination of the agreement by us in the event of default by bae systems  or iii termination of the subcontract for convenience 
we own all the intellectual property associated with the ilav design  including improvements 
we are a party to another license agreement with csir  pursuant to which we received two separate licenses 
the first is a fully paid up internal license to perform research and development to verify  test and develop certain technology the protection of wheeled and tracked vehicles against landmines and ieds as disclosed in its patent and assess the market for products through the parties written agreement of proof of concept quantification and demonstration of the protection level and operation in consideration of investing research and development funding since january  by august   the proof of concept was obtained  and we are required to pay an exclusivity fee to csir that is deferred but paid through any sales of wheels and tracks for the second license 
this second license also includes an annual license to exploit  including the exclusive manufacture  marketing  sale and use  the licensed technology in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  france  israel  germany and nonexclusively in south africa 
environmental matters we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment  including air  water and soil

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
please also see special note regarding forward looking statements on page if we are unable to obtain future orders for our vehicles  products or services  our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be adversely affected and our business may fail 
substantially all of our revenue comes from our us and foreign military sales contracts  either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor to another prime contractor to the us  or direct commercial sales contracts to foreign governments 
we received and fulfilled substantial orders for products and services to upgrade or maintain our vehicles from the us and foreign military sales customers under the mrap program  which accounted for a majority of our net sales during the year ended december  in  we also received and fulfilled a large direct commercial sales 
table of contents contract with the uk ministry of defence for our wolfhound vehicle 
these orders have resulted  in significant part  from the particular combat situations encountered by the military forces in iraq and transition to afghanistan 
we cannot be certain of the degree to which military users will continue to place orders  and these orders may decrease significantly or cease 
the main uncertainty about our future operations is whether we will continue to receive additional orders or contracts for our vehicles  products  services or our survivability solutions 
we have no substantial orders for vehicles to fulfill at this time under the mrap competitive contract  although we do have orders for products and services 
orders for our buffalo and cougar variant vehicles will allow us to continue production through the third quarter of it is impossible to predict with certainty whether such future orders or contracts will be placed by existing or new customers 
if we do not receive future orders or contracts for production beyond such dates  it is unlikely that our vehicle business will continue and our business will be materially affected 
even if we are successful in obtaining contracts  the length of the contract cycle  from testing  pre production to the delivery of the order when revenue is recognized  may span several months to years 
we rely on sales to the us government  and a failure to obtain new contracts or a reduction of sales under existing contracts with the us government could adversely affect our operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow to fund our operations 
the continuation and renewal of contracts with the us government are contingent upon the availability of governmental funding  which may be unpredictable 
presently  we derive a majority of our revenue from contracts and subcontracts with the us government and its agencies  primarily the us department of defense 
we expect that us and foreign government contracts will continue to be our main source of revenue for the foreseeable future 
the continuation and renewal of our existing contracts and new contracts are  among other things  contingent upon the availability of adequate funding from various us government and foreign agencies 
changes in us and foreign government spending could directly affect our operating performance and lead to an unexpected loss of revenue 
our us government contracts are also subject to continual approval and funding 
our us government contracts may be terminated or adversely modified prior to completion  which could adversely affect our business 
federal government contracts generally contain provisions  and are subject to laws and regulations  that provide the federal government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts  including provisions permitting the federal government to  among other provisions terminate our existing contracts for convenience  unilaterally modify some of the terms and conditions in our existing contracts  subject the award to protest or challenge by competitors  suspend work under existing multiple year contracts and related delivery orders  and claim rights in technologies and systems invented  developed or produced by us 
we may start to complete work for a contract that is eventually terminated  which may cause us to incur expenses for which we are not reimbursed  and we may incur losses 
given the ability of the federal government to unilaterally terminate a contract  we experience more uncertainty with respect to the fulfillment of our orders  which may make our forecasts more unpredictable 
as a result  our backlog is subject to uncertainties  and there can be no assurance that we will deliver or receive payment for the vehicles we have included in our backlog 

table of contents many of our orders are subject to the competitive bidding process  which we may not win  and we may incur expenses that we are unable to recoup  creating losses 
we have received certain contract awards through the competitive bidding process and may continue to do so in the future 
however  the competitive bidding process presents a number of risks  including bidding against large and established government contractors with substantially greater resources 
competitive bidding also involves costs which may not be recouped  cost overruns  or awards subject to bid protest 
also  due to the commercial nature of many vehicle components  we compete with established commercial vehicle suppliers and component original equipment manufacturers oems for spare part sales 
as a result  we may incur losses  which could adversely affect our business 
our business may be materially affected if we are unable to anticipate the demand for and sale of next generation vehicles  products or services to meet the demands of our customers  and our net sales may decline 
the future of our business depends on our ability to anticipate threats to the survivability of friendly forces and to develop  test  and be able to produce solutions to counter these threats in a manner that satisfies the cost  performance  and schedule demands of our customers 
prospective customers may require product features and capabilities that our current products do not have 
we may be unable to respond quickly or effectively to these developments 
to the extent that our customers seek additional survivability solutions  we expect to face substantial competition from other companies  many of which have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do  in competing for these orders 
accordingly  if we are unable to develop and design acceptable vehicles  products or services in time to meet the demands of our customers  our net sales may decline in the future 
in addition  the introduction of new products by competitors  the emergence of new industry standards  or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing product offerings could render our existing or future products obsolete 
if our products become technologically obsolete  customers may purchase solutions from our competitors and we may be unable to sell our products in the marketplace and generate revenue which may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in response to competitive opportunities or to meet customer demands  we may start the development and manufacture of certain of our products for which we may not have orders and may incur losses 
at times  if we believe that there is a probability of selling certain of our vehicles or products  we may commence the manufacture and production of such items without orders 
we have in the past  and may do so in the future  commence the development and manufacture of our vehicles and products  and incur expenses for components  raw materials  and other expenses without any orders from customers 
we may experience difficulties  expenses and delays in starting up production for these vehicles if we have no prior experience in manufacturing such vehicles and products in commercial quantities and it may take a substantial period of time for us and our employees to achieve requisite efficiencies in producing such vehicles or products 
in the event that we do not receive orders for these vehicles or products  we may have excess inventory and incur losses  and  as a result  our business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows may be affected 

table of contents we rely on joint ventures  teaming agreements  subcontractors and suppliers to manufacture  perform some of the assembly of our vehicles  or supply products 
the loss of any critical partner could delay our manufacturing operations  which could affect our ability to meet our contract delivery requirements to our customers 
we have in the past  and anticipate in the future  increased outsourcing of the manufacture of our vehicles or products 
if any of our selected partners  subcontractors and suppliers cease doing business with us or fail to perform  we would have to develop new sources or perform the work ourselves 
in the event that we are unable to obtain required products or services from our existing partners  subcontractors or suppliers  and if we are unable to mitigate the impact or find alternate sources in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce our vehicles and provide repairs and sustainment  and  as a result  our business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows may be affected 
our limited control over our joint ventures  partners and subcontractors may delay or prevent us from implementing our business strategy which may adversely affect our financial results 
we are currently party to joint ventures  subcontracts  teaming agreements and joint development arrangements with several partners  some of which are competitors 
we may also enter into additional arrangements in the future 
because we have shared control over our joint ventures and limited control over our partners and subcontractors  we may not be able to require them to take actions that we believe are necessary to implement our business strategy 
if our partners or subcontractors fail to fulfill their obligations  we could be responsible to the customer and would have to rely on our ability to obtain reimbursement from our partner or subcontractor for our costs  over and above any reimbursement which may be due from the customer 
obtaining such reimbursement could require us to engage in litigation and could take a substantial amount of time and could require us to expend significant resources 
if our partner or subcontractor becomes insolvent or ceases operations  we might not be able to obtain reimbursement 
accordingly  this limited control could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
our configuration management process for our fielded fleet is still maturing and may result in inadequate delivery of service and repair parts which may decrease our ability to generate life cycle revenue 
as a result of the rapid deployment and production demand for our vehicles by the us military in iraq and afghanistan  we have not been able to fully develop technical data packages and establish our service parts documentation for configuration control for all of our vehicles 
as a result  we may lose business opportunities for some aftermarket part orders  such as spare parts  and training and field service support  and we could be late or delayed in accepting and delivering aftermarket orders  and our future revenue may be negatively impacted 
our business may be adversely affected by the severe and rapid downturn in the economy 
recently  there has been a severe and rapid downturn in the economy due to a variety of financial conditions 
we cannot predict the timing or duration of the effects of these conditions on our business 
these conditions make it difficult for us to accurately forecast  plan and execute certain future business activities 
due to the recent credit crisis and volatility of the us dollar against other currencies  our products may become more expensive for customers whose purchases are denominated in us dollars  which may further disadvantage us relative to our competitors or negatively impact our margins 

table of contents changes in the pace of operations in iraq or afghanistan or the duration of involvement by the us military and foreign militaries in areas of conflict could have an impact on contracts for our vehicles  spare parts and sustainment services 
as a result  we may have unexpected revenue shortfalls 
political pressure  the success of the current operations  changes in tactics of the insurgency  and other factors make it difficult to ascertain customer requirements 
the challenging economic environment and potential changes in defense spending by the us government may have an adverse impact on the number and volume of future orders placed for our products and services  which could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations 
we are expanding international operations  which subjects us to additional business risks that may have a material adverse effect on our business 
expanding international sales and operations is a part of our growth strategy 
in  we established a wholly owned subsidiary and a joint venture in the united kingdom and began operations in kuwait 
international operations and sales are subject to various risks  including foreign currency  political  economic  trade barriers  foreign government regulations and taxes  governmental expropriation and differences in business practices 
we may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries in connection with starting up international manufacturing operations that could cause a loss 
failure of performance could impact revenue and result in contract disputes 
in addition  we are subject to export control regulations  including  without limitation  the united states export administration regulations and the international traffic in arms regulations  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may make acquisitions  which may pose risks to our business and dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 
we may enter into acquisitions in the future in an effort to enhance shareholder value 
while we do not have any present plans to acquire businesses  technologies or services  we may enter into such arrangements in the future in order to expand our capabilities  enter new markets  or increase our market share 
we do not have any experience in completing an acquisition 
acquisitions involve a certain amount of risks and uncertainties that could result in our not achieving expected benefits 
with respect to acquisitions  such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and cost effective manner  challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives  cost savings and other benefits  the risk that the acquired businesses markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets  the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 
in addition  unanticipated delays or difficulties in effecting acquisitions may divert the attention of our management and resources from our existing operations 
future acquisitions by us could also result in large and immediate write offs or assumptions of debt and contingent liabilities  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
our operations could be adversely affected by interruptions of production that are beyond our control 
our business and financial results may be affected by certain events that we cannot anticipate or that are beyond our control  such as natural disasters and national emergencies that could curtail production at our facilities and cause delayed deliveries and canceled orders 
in addition  we purchase components and raw materials and information technology and other services from numerous suppliers  and  even if our facilities are not directly affected by such events  we could be affected by interruptions in our manufacturing and delivery performance 
such suppliers may be less likely than our own facilities to be able to quickly recover from such events  or may not be able to recover  which would subject us to additional delays and difficulty conducting our operations 

table of contents we may be unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and other related provisions of the us securities laws and in the past we have restated our condensed consolidated financial statements and other financial information for the periods ended march   june   and september  if we have additional ineffective internal controls or restatements of our financial statements  they may result in potential and current shareholders losing confidence in our financial reporting  which could adversely affect perceptions of our company and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 
we have a limited history of maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and due to such limited history  we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain effective systems of internal controls in the future 
in prior years  we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective 
for the years ended december   and  we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
as a result  in part because of these material weaknesses  we also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december   december  and december  to the extent that we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures  we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports and public disclosure  detect and prevent fraud and comply with the reporting obligations under the us securities laws  on a timely basis 
any such failure could harm our business 
in addition  failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and public disclosure  which in turn could cause customers and investors to lose confidence in our business 
our previous material weaknesses and significant deficiencies resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that we prepare will not be prevented or detected 
although we believe we have adequately corrected our significant deficiencies  we may still be subject to risks associated with our prior significant deficiencies 
in addition  we restated our condensed consolidated financial statements and other financial information for the periods ended march   june   and september  and filed separate amended quarterly reports on form q to reflect the restated condensed consolidated financial statements for such periods 
we also previously amended our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   and restated our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   and in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  additional amendments and restatements to our financial statements may result in potential and current shareholders losing confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm our business and the market price of our stock 
we are subject to and may continue to be subject to lawsuits alleging false or misleading public statements and or omissions concerning our business  internal controls and financial results 
we are subject to shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits  which have been initiated for damages to recompense those who purchased or otherwise acquired our securities 
the causes of actions include  but are not limited to  allegations that certain former members of management and the board of directors violated the exchange act and made false or misleading public statements or omissions concerning our business  internal controls  and financial results 
see more detail in item  legal proceedings 
it is possible that other litigants may institute additional lawsuits against us as a result of these alleged deficiencies seeking the payment of damages 
these lawsuits are likely to be costly to defend and could involve the substantial diversion of management time and resources and 
table of contents have other adverse effects  and we may be required to make substantial payments to settle any such lawsuits or to satisfy any judgments that may be rendered against us 
the dcaa continues to audit certain of our price proposals and indirect rate submissions as required by the federal acquisition regulations far 
as a result  the dcaa could question or disallow our proposed costs under some of our government contracts  and our profits may be adversely affected 
us government agencies  generally through the dcaa  routinely audit and monitor government contracts and government contractors administrative processes and systems 
the audits may review the costs we incur on our us government contracts  including allocated indirect costs 
the auditor may also review our compliance with applicable laws  government regulations  policies and standards as they relate to cost issues and the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies 
an adverse finding under a dcaa audit could result in the disallowance of our costs under a us government contract 
if any audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government 
in addition  responding to governmental audits may involve significant expense and divert management attention 
presently  all of our contracts are on a fixed price basis  which could subject us to losses if there are cost overruns 
under a fixed price contract  we receive only the amount indicated in the contract  regardless of the actual cost to produce the goods 
while firm fixed price contracts allow us to benefit from potential cost savings  they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns 
if the estimates we use to calculate the contract price or the cost to perform the work prove to be incorrect  we could incur losses 
in addition  some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to schedule and performance  which may result in penalties for failure to perform 
as a result  we could incur losses which would adversely affect our business 
we may require additional capital to provide for our working capital needs 
we may require additional capital for our business needs 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  contained elsewhere herein 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such additional capital on acceptable terms or at all 
the credit markets and the financial services industry continue to experience a period of unprecedented turmoil characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the federal government 
our ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we were to lose the services of our key personnel  or if we are unable to recruit qualified managers and key personnel in the future 
our success depends on the continued service of our management team and certain key personnel 
if we are unable to retain our existing managers and employees or hire and integrate new personnel  we may experience operating inefficiencies  production delays and reduced profitability or losses 
we must comply with export control laws  foreign corrupt practices  numerous miscellaneous federal national security laws  regulations  and procedures  as well as the rules and regulations of foreign jurisdictions  and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to export and import licensing requirements with respect to the marketing and sales  testing  service and support in foreign countries of our vehicles  products and services 
in addition  we are obligated to comply with a variety of federal  state and local regulations  both domestically and abroad  governing certain aspects of our international sales and support 

table of contents we are subject to the fcpa and other laws which prohibit improper payments to foreign governments and their officials by us and other business entities 
our operations in such countries create the risk of an unauthorized payment by one of our employees or agents which would be in violation of various laws including the fcpa 
we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of federal government contracts including far and similar foreign government regulations 
these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our federal government and foreign governments 
in complying with these laws and regulations  we may incur additional costs  and non compliance may also allow for the assignment of fines and penalties  including liquidated contractual damages 
we are subject to industrial security regulations of the us department of defense and other federal agencies that are designed to safeguard against foreigners access to classified information 
as we continue to expand our operations internationally  we are subject to the rules and regulations of foreign jurisdictions 
if we were to come under foreign ownership  control or influence  we could lose our facility security clearances  which could result in our federal government customers terminating or deciding not to renew our contracts  and could impair our ability to obtain new contracts 
we are presently subject to a number of legal proceedings and claims and we may become subject to additional legal proceedings and claims in the future 
we have been subject to a variety of lawsuits  including claims involving the use of our confidential information and trade secrets  equal employment opportunity commission claims  contractual claims  claims related to our common shares  and osha claims 
such claims and regulatory inquiries  whether successful or not  could require us to devote significant amounts of money for legal defense  human resources and senior management time to defend ourselves and could harm our reputation 
if  as a result of any proceedings  a settlement is reached  a judgment is rendered or a decree is entered against us  it could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and harm our reputation 
see item  legal proceedings in part i of this annual report on form k 
we may not be able to adequately safeguard our intellectual property rights and trade secrets from unauthorized use  and we may become subject to claims that we infringe on others intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  trademarks  and other intellectual property laws  licensing agreements  nondisclosure agreements with employees  subcontractors  partners and suppliers and other protective measures to preserve our proprietary rights to our products and production processes 
our pending patent applications may not be granted by the various patent offices examining them 
even if our patent applications are granted and issued as patents  these measures afford only limited protection and may not preclude competitors from developing products or processes similar or superior to ours 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
furthermore  third parties may assert that our products or processes infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 
enforcing or defending our proprietary rights could be expensive  require management s attention and might not bring us timely or effective relief 
compliance with increasing environmental regulations and the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us 
we  like other industry participants  are subject to various federal  state  local and international environmental laws and regulations 
our operations require the handling  use  storage and disposal of 
table of contents certain regulated materials and wastes 
these requirements govern  among other things  emissions to air  discharge to waters and the generation  handling  storage  treatment and disposal of waste and remediation of contaminated sites 
we have made  and will continue to make  capital and other expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations in both the us and abroad 
we may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future  particularly as climate change initiatives increase in focus 
future developments  administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
risks related to our common stock our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of shares of blank check preferred stock 
under the terms of our articles of incorporation  our board of directors is authorized to issue from time to time  without any need for approval by our shareholders but subject to any limitations prescribed by law  shares of our preferred stock in one or more series 
each series shall consist of such number of shares and have the rights  preferences  powers and restrictions  such as dividend rights and preferences  conversion rights  voting rights  terms of redemption and liquidation rights and preferences  as our board of directors shall determine 
such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights 
the board of directors may issue preferred stock with voting  conversion or other rights that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company and that could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
our stock price has been volatile  and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline 
the market price and trading volume of our common stock has been subject to significant volatility  and this trend may continue 
for example  in the last quarter of fiscal year  the price of our common stock ranged from to 
the value of our common stock may decline regardless of our operating performance or prospects 
factors affecting our market price include  but are not limited to  our failure to meet expectations regarding new orders or sales of our vehicles  differences between our reported results and those expected by investors and securities analysts  announcements of new contracts or orders by us or our competitors  and market reaction to any future acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors 
recent events have caused stock prices for many companies  including ours  to fluctuate in ways unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance 
the general economic  political and stock market conditions that may affect the market price of our common stock are beyond our control 
the continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial markets has had and may continue to have an impact on our stock price 
the market price of our common stock at any particular time may not remain the market price in the future 
in the past  securities class action litigation has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
any such litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
anti takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation and by laws  as well as nevada corporation law  could make it difficult for our shareholders to replace or remove our current board of directors or have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as discussed above  our board of directors is empowered to issue preferred stock in one or more series without shareholder approval 
any issuance of this blank check preferred stock could materially limit the rights of holders of the common stock and render more difficult or discourage an 
table of contents attempt to obtain control of us by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
in addition  our articles of incorporation and by laws contain a number of provisions that could impede a takeover or change in control of us  including our staggered board  limitation on the ability of our shareholders to act by written consent  advance notice provisions and the ability for the board of directors to fill a vacancy on our board of directors 
certain provisions of the nevada general corporation law could also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by our board of directors or shareholders 
these provisions relate to  among other things  the acquisition of a controlling interest in a nevada corporation meeting certain requirements or certain business combinations and other transactions between a nevada corporation and certain interested stockholders

overview we provide survivability solutions to support the armed forces of the united states and its allies which are in harm s way 
we design  manufacture  test  deliver and support our blast and ballistic protected products to increase the survivability of the users of our products 
currently  we only have one segment of operations  our survivability solutions 
our specialty vehicles  which we believe are at the forefront of blast and ballistic protected technology  are designed to protect their occupants from landmines  hostile fire  and improvised explosive devices  referred to as ieds 
in addition  we develop  manufacture  test  deliver and support products and services aimed at further enhancing the survivability of our users against additional threats 
capitalizing on our strengths in survivability solutions  we are moving ahead to enhance the protection level of our armor kits as well as developing additional products to protect against rocket propelled grenades and under body armor kits to mitigate 
table of contents blast effects on other military vehicles 
we are a key provider of the us military s mine resistant ambush protected mrap vehicle program and have sold and delivered over  vehicles under this program 
we also provide our cougar and buffalo mine protected vehicles to several foreign customers  including the uk ministry of defence  who has purchased three variants of our cougar vehicle 
across all vehicle programs we have sold approximately  vehicles since we also provide long term life cycle support services of our vehicles that involve development of technical data packages  supply of spares  field and depot maintenance activities  assignment of highly skilled field service representatives  and advanced off road driver and maintenance training programs 
our services are based on establishing and maintaining long term relationships with the us government and foreign military users 
our business is heavily influenced by the needs of the us military for blast and ballistic protected wheeled vehicles 
the us department of defense is our largest customer 
for the past several years  substantially all of our net sales have been derived from the us government 
we align our workforce to satisfy our business requirements 
financial highlights for the fiscal year ended december  include record shipments of buffalo vehicles for the year  expanded our business to include modernization  with sales of million  sales from spares and sustainment increased to million  gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to general and administrative expenses decreased to million  research and development expenses increased million to million  and net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million 
outlook the global war on terrorism  especially in iraq and afghanistan  has confirmed that ieds  landmines  explosively formed projectiles and rocket propelled grenades pose a significant threat to coalition military personnel and civilians 
we believe the world market for blast and ballistic protected military vehicles and other survivability solutions will remain at high levels in the short term 
the  troop surge of forces to afghanistan will take most of to achieve and additional mraps from original equipment manufacturers oems will be required to support operations 
landmines and ieds have been used extensively by terrorists and insurgent groups in iraq and other areas because of their highly effective nature and relatively low cost 
in  us forces began drawing down from iraq 
the long term commitment of us forces in afghanistan is uncertain 
consequently  us and international military departments are in the process of determining long term roles for mraps 
the future requirements for long term life cycle logistics plans  as well as an important effort to reset and recapitalize vehicles that come out of theater  are still to be determined 
mraps can be placed into permanent military organizations for convoy security  route clearance  explosive ordnance disposal and casualty evacuation  or be placed into prepositioned storage roles for regional response  or be sold to foreign military customers 
our fiscal outlook is based on the following market assumptions and expectations a likely reduction of combat forces and our vehicles in iraq  which will significantly reduce the operational tempo placed on our fleet  as well as the requirement for our field service representatives resourced to support units in that theater 
conversely  we expect growth of 
table of contents military forces  our vehicles and all mraps in afghanistan  which will necessitate changes to our vehicles and increase sustainment maintenance requirements  our current customers are expected to develop modernization and sustainment plans for our fielded fleet of vehicles and we will have to compete for the spares and sustainment support business for our fielded fleet of vehicles  uncertainty in defense spending  due to the current administration s defense strategy  as well as the dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions  challenges with the expansion of our customers  products and services both domestically and internationally 
we will continue to try to capture contract awards for our products and services in a volatile marketplace  establishing long term programs to include upgrades  remanufacture  and sustainment for our fleet of vehicles  and then expand this capability to sustaining all mraps universally  developing new products and services to bring to market  and rationalizing our cost structure to match our sales 
strategic outlook our business strategy is focused on increasing shareholder value by providing products and services that are relevant  responsive  innovative  high quality and affordable 
we intend to maintain and expand our current business as a key supplier of survivability solutions  including protected vehicles  total life cycle support and other services  to the us department of defense  other us government agencies  foreign governments  and domestic and international commercial customers 
our strategy is focused on growing balanced diverse revenue and earnings through organic growth  cost containment  and selected acquisitions  enabling us to grow the company 
specific components of the strategy  discussed in greater detail in item  business  include the following improved performance on contracts  capitalize on our current business and grow sales organically  continuously improve our cost structure  introduce new products and invest in research and development  and diversify through selected acquisitions 
we believe the global need for blast and ballistic protected military vehicles and other survivability solutions will remain high through the  troops surge of force in afghanistan is expected take most of to achieve and additional mraps are expected to be required to support operations in this theater 
however  us forces are expected to draw down from iraq at the same time and many mraps will be transferred from iraq to afghanistan 
the us and foreign military departments are determining the current and future roles for mrap vehicles 
we expect a large number of our currently deployed vehicles will remain in service or be pre positioned for rapid deployment 
these vehicles will likely require an overhaul and modification to remain fit for their purpose 
we will leverage our manufacturing skills and field services to support our customers in maintaining readiness for these highly valued assets 
although much of this work will involve large depot facilities  the magnitude of work could exceed our capacity and require partnerships to complete work on schedule 
as we discussed in item a  controls and procedures  in part ii of this annual report on form k  we have effective controls in place as of december  we will continue to devote 
table of contents our resources  in an amount we believe to be appropriate  to maintain these effective internal controls over our financial reporting and disclosures

we did not have any significant capital expenditures for manufacturing during during  capital expenditures were million  mostly due to upgrades of our information technology infrastructure as well as leasehold improvements

after that time  we expect that we may need to obtain additional sources of capital  which may include borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities  including common stock  and there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us when we need it or  if available  that the terms of any such financing will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our shareholders

as of december   we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december  and  we were not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
contractual obligations achieving optimal returns on cash often involves making long term commitments 
sec regulations require that we present our contractual obligations  and we have done so in the table that follows 
however  our future cash flow prospects cannot reasonably be assessed based on such obligations  as the most significant factor affecting our future cash flows is our ability to earn and collect cash from our customers 
future cash outflows  whether they are contractual obligations or not  will vary based on our future needs 
while some such outflows are completely fixed for example  commitments to repay principal and interest on fixed rate borrowings  most will depend on future events for example  payments to subcontractors under long term contracts 
further  normal operations involve significant expenditures that are not based on commitments for example  amounts paid for income taxes or for payroll 
our consolidated contractual obligations as of december   are as follows in thousands total and thereafter operating lease obligations a b d purchase obligations b c d other long term liabilities d e total a we lease most of our facilities as well as other property and equipment under operating leases in the normal course of business 
some of our facility leases contain escalation clauses 
the minimum lease payments do not include contingent rental expense 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
for more information  see note  property and equipment  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
b future operating lease obligations and purchase obligations are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
c purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on force protection and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
d because our future cash outflows are uncertain  the following liabilities are excluded from the table above workers compensation risks  deferred income taxes and our warranty reserve 
e includes accreted interest at for the non compete agreement portion 

table of contents dividends we have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain earnings  if any  to finance the growth and development of our business  and we do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
payment of future dividends  if any  will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements  restrictions contained in current or future financing instruments  and other factors the board deems relevant 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
significant estimates and assumptions are used for  but are not limited to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  definitization and advance payments on contracts  inventory costs and reserves  asset impairments  depreciable lives of assets  economic lives and fair value of leased assets  income tax reserves and valuation allowances  fair value of stock options and restricted stock  allocation of cost of sales and general and administrative expenses  and litigation reserves 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty  and accordingly  our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
we evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations 
actual results could differ from the estimates we have used 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  as they require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market value and net of the cost of obsolete items 
the determination of inventory valuation reserves requires management to make estimates and judgments on the future salability of inventories 
valuation reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory for which the resale value or replacement value is less than the inventoriable cost 
other factors that management considers in determining these reserves include whether individual inventory parts meet current specifications and can be substituted for a part currently being sold or used as a service part  overall market conditions  and other inventory management initiatives 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for obsolete inventories 
in the future  if our inventories are determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventories are determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of sales in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities 
they are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the income of the period that includes the enactment date 
in addition  we establish reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which was codified into asc topic  income taxes 
a high degree of judgment is required to determine if  and the extent to which  valuation allowances should be recorded against deferred tax assets 
in the current year  it was determined that a valuation allowance was necessary for years ending december   and due to the inclusion of south carolina state tax credits as a deferred tax asset 
it is anticipated that these credits may not be fully utilized due to a low apportionment factor in the state 
the valuation allowance for previous years had not been recorded in those years as the related deferred tax asset had not yet been booked 
contingent tax liabilities are based on our assessment of the likelihood that we have incurred a liability 
such liabilities are reviewed based on recent changes in tax laws and regulations  including judicial rulings 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income taxes that could be material 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions assessment of loss contingencies we have legal and other contingencies  including product warranties and contract price definitization  which could result in significant losses upon the ultimate resolution of such contingencies 
we have provided for losses in situations where we have concluded that it is probable that a loss has been or will be incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining whether a loss is probable and reasonably estimable due to the uncertainty involved in determining the likelihood of future events and estimating the financial statement impact of such events 
if further developments or resolution of a contingent matter are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may need to recognize a significant charge in a future period related to an existing contingency 
recent accounting pronouncements see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the new accounting standards that are applicable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity prices we are exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices 
if the price of steel increases significantly  the cost of our products could increase 
it is unlikely we will be able to pass on this cost under our current contracts 
as a result  if the cost of our raw material increases  our profitability  if any  could decrease 
we buy and stock key steel materials at competitive current prices  based on projected trends of steel surcharge movement 
additionally  we add annual escalations and adjust prices for extraordinary circumstances to all steel long term contracts 
in cases where subcontractors purchase steel directly  we mirror supplier terms and conditions to customer terms and conditions to mitigate commodity risks 
foreign currency the majority of our business is denominated in us dollars and as such  movement in the foreign currency markets will have a minimal direct impact on our business 
interest rates we do not have a trading portfolio and although our current financing arrangement is at a variable rate  we do not have any borrowings under the arrangement 
as a result  we are not currently directly at risk of interest rate fluctuations 
as our financing needs change in the future  interest rate risk may become a more significant issue for us 
currently  we do not use any derivative financial instruments for the purpose of reducing our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange  or commodity prices 
we are not a party to leveraged derivatives nor do we hold or issue financial investments for speculative purposes
