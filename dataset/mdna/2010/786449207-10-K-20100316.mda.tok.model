principles of accounting for ownership interests in partner companies we account for our interests in our partner companies and private equity funds using any of four methods consolidation  fair value  equity or cost 
the accounting method applied is generally determined by the degree of our influence over the entity  primarily determined by our voting interest in the entity 
consolidation method 
we account for our partner companies in which we maintain a controlling financial interest  generally those in which we directly or indirectly own more than of the outstanding voting securities  using the consolidation method of accounting 
upon consolidation of our partner companies  we reflect the portion of equity net assets in a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to the parent company as a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheet 
the noncontrolling interest is presented within equity  separately from the equity of the parent company 
losses attributable to the parent company and the noncontrolling interest may exceed their interest in the subsidiary s equity 
as a result  the noncontrolling interest shall continue to be attributed 
table of contents its share of losses even if that attribution results in a deficit noncontrolling interest balance as of each balance sheet date 
revenue  expenses  gains  losses  net income or loss are reported in the consolidated statements of operations at the consolidated amounts  which include the amounts attributable to the parent company s common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest 
as of december   we did not hold a controlling interest in any of our partner companies 
equity method 
we account for partner companies whose results are not consolidated  but over whom we exercise significant influence  using the equity method of accounting 
we also account for our interests in some private equity funds under the equity method of accounting  depending on our general and limited partner interests 
under the equity method of accounting  our share of the income or loss of the company is reflected in equity loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
we report our share of the income or loss of the equity method partner companies on a one quarter lag 
when the carrying value of our holding in an equity method partner company is reduced to zero  no further losses are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations unless we have outstanding guarantee obligations or have committed additional funding to the equity method partner company 
when the equity method partner company subsequently reports income  we will not record our share of such income until it equals the amount of our share of losses not previously recognized 
cost method 
we account for partner companies which are not consolidated or accounted for under the equity method using the cost method of accounting 
under the cost method  our share of the income or losses of such partner companies is not included in our consolidated statements of operations 
however  the effect of the change in market value of cost method partner company holdings classified as trading securities is reflected in other income loss  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
at december   we did not maintain any cost method partner company holdings classified as trading securities 
fair value method 
we account for our holdings in clarient  our publicly traded partner company  under the fair value option following its deconsolidation on may  unrealized gains and losses on the mark to market of our holdings in clarient and realized gains and losses on the sale of any of our holdings in clarient are recognized in income loss from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
these judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly important because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include the following revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense  impairment of ownership interests in and advances to companies  income taxes  commitments and contingencies  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition as of may   the date that clarient was deconsolidated  we no longer report revenue from clarient s continuing operations 
prior to that date  all of our revenue from continuing operations for the periods presented was attributable to clarient 

table of contents revenue for clarient s diagnostic testing and interpretive services was recognized at the time of completion of such services 
clarient s services were billed to various payors  including medicare  health insurance companies and other directly billed healthcare institutions and patients 
clarient reported revenue from contracted payors  including certain health insurance companies and healthcare institutions  based on the contracted rate or  in certain instances  clarient s estimate of such rate 
for billings to medicare  clarient utilized the published fee schedules  net of standard discounts commonly referred to as contractual allowances 
clarient reported revenue from non contracted payors  including certain insurance companies and patients  based on the amount expected to be collected for services provided 
adjustments resulting from actual collections compared to clarient s estimates were recognized in the period realized 
allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense all trade accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet at december  related to clarient 
on may   all of the assets and liabilities of clarient were deconsolidated 
we have no trade accounts receivable at december  on the consolidated balance sheet 
an allowance for doubtful accounts was recorded for estimated uncollectible amounts due from various payor groups such as medicare and private health insurance companies 
the process for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with clarient s diagnostic services involved significant assumptions and judgments 
specifically  the allowance for doubtful accounts was adjusted periodically  based upon an evaluation of historical collection experience 
clarient also reviewed the age of receivables by payor class to assess its allowance at each period end 
the payment realization cycle for certain governmental and managed care payors can be lengthy  involving denial  appeal and adjudication processes  and was subject to periodic adjustments that may be significant 
accounts receivable were periodically written off when identified as uncollectible and deducted from the allowance for doubtful accounts after appropriate collection efforts had been exhausted 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts were charged to bad debt expense within selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of ownership interests in and advances to companies on a periodic basis  but no less frequently than quarterly  we evaluate the carrying value of our equity and cost method partner companies for possible impairment based on achievement of business plan objectives and milestones  the financial condition and prospects of the company  market conditions and other relevant factors 
the business plan objectives and milestones we consider include  among others  those related to financial performance  such as achievement of planned financial results or completion of capital raising activities  and those that are not primarily financial in nature  such as hiring of key employees or the establishment of strategic relationships 
we then determine whether there has been an other than temporary decline in the value of our ownership interest in the company 
impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value 
the new carrying value of a partner company is not increased if circumstances suggest the value of the partner company has subsequently recovered 
the fair value of privately held partner companies is generally determined based on the value at which independent third parties have invested or have committed to invest in these companies  or based on other valuation methods including discounted cash flows  valuations of comparable public companies and valuations of acquisitions of comparable companies 
the fair value of our ownership interests in private equity funds is generally determined based on the value of our pro rata portion of the funds net assets and estimated future proceeds from sales of investments provided by the funds managers 
the fair value of our ownership interest in clarient is determined by reference to quoted prices in an active market for clarient s publicly traded common stock 
our partner companies operate in industries which are rapidly evolving and extremely competitive 
it is reasonably possible that our accounting estimates with respect to the ultimate recoverability of the carrying value of ownership interests in and advances to companies could change in the near term and that the effect of such changes on our consolidated financial statements could be material 
while we believe that the current recorded carrying values of our equity and cost method companies are not impaired  there can be no assurance that our future results will confirm this assessment or that a significant write down or write off will not be required in the future 

table of contents total impairment charges related to ownership interests in and advances to our equity and cost method partner companies were as follows year ended december  accounting method in millions equity cost total impairment charges related to equity method partner companies are included in equity loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
impairment charges related to cost method partner companies are included in other income loss  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that we believe recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future years 
if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
commitments and contingencies from time to time  we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions which arise in the normal course of business 
additionally  we have received distributions as both a general partner and a limited partner from private equity funds 
in certain circumstances  we may be required to return a portion or all the distributions we received as a general partner of a fund for a further distribution to such fund s limited partners clawback 
we are also a guarantor of various third party obligations and commitments and are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business see note 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of provision required for these commitments and contingencies  if any  which would be charged to earnings  is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the provision may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
changes in the provision could increase or decrease our earnings in the period the changes are made 
stock based compensation we measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the expected term of the award and the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term 
changes in these assumptions and in the estimated forfeitures of stock option awards can materially affect the amount of stock based compensation recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the requisite service periods for market based stock option awards are based on our estimate of the dates on which the market conditions will be met as determined using a monte carlo simulation model 
changes in the derived requisite service period or achievement of market capitalization targets earlier than estimated can materially affect the amount of stock based compensation recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the requisite service periods for performance based awards are based on our best estimate of when the performance conditions will be met 
compensation expense is 
table of contents recognized for performance based awards for which the performance condition is considered probable of achievement 
changes in the requisite service period or the estimated probability of achievement of performance conditions can materially affect the amount of stock based compensation recognized in the consolidated statements of operations

our board of directors authorizations regarding common stock and debentures repurchases do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock or debentures and may be modified or suspended at any time at our discretion 
in february  we entered into a loan agreement which provides us with a revolving credit facility in the maximum aggregate amount of million in the form of borrowings  guarantees and issuances of letters of credit subject to a million sublimit 
actual availability under the credit facility is based on the amount of cash maintained at the bank as well as the value of our public and private partner company interests 
this credit facility bears interest at the prime rate for outstanding borrowings  subject to an increase in certain circumstances 
other than for limited exceptions  we are required to maintain all of our depository and operating accounts and not less than of our investment and securities accounts at the bank 
the credit facility matures on december  under the credit facility  we provided a million letter of credit expiring on march  to the landlord of compucom systems  inc s dallas headquarters which has been required in connection with our sale of compucom systems in availability under our revolving credit facility at december  was million 
we have committed capital of approximately million  including conditional commitments to provide partner companies with additional funding and commitments made to various private equity funds in prior years 
these commitments will be funded over the next several years  including approximately million which is expected to be funded in the next months 
the transactions we enter into in pursuit of our strategy could increase or decrease our liquidity at any point in time 
as we seek to acquire interests in technology and life sciences companies  provide additional funding to existing partner companies  or commit capital to other initiatives  we may be required to expend our cash or incur debt  which will decrease our liquidity 
conversely  as we dispose of our interests in partner companies from time to time  we may receive proceeds from such sales  which could increase our liquidity 
from time to time  we are engaged in discussions concerning acquisitions and dispositions which  if consummated  could impact our liquidity  perhaps significantly 
in may  we entered into a million loan agreement with warren v 
musser  our former chairman and chief executive officer 
in december  we restructured the obligation to reduce the amount outstanding to million  bearing interest at a rate of per annum 
cash payments  when received  are recognized as recovery related party in our consolidated statements of operations 
since and through december   we have received a total of million in payments on the loan 
the carrying value of the loan at december  was zero 
we have received distributions as both a general partner and a limited partner from certain private equity funds 
under certain circumstances  we may be required to return a portion or all the distributions we received as a general partner of a fund for further distribution to such fund s limited partners clawback 
the maximum clawback we could be required to return related to our general partner interest is million  of which million was reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and million was reflected in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at december  our previous ownership in the general partners of the funds that have potential clawback liabilities ranges from 
the clawback liability is joint and several  such that we may be required to fund the clawback for other general partners should they default 
the funds have taken several steps to reduce the potential liabilities should other general partners default  including withholding all general partner distributions and placing them in escrow and adding rights of set off among certain funds 
we believe our potential liability due to the possibility of default by other general partners is remote 
for the reasons we presented above  we believe our cash and cash equivalents at december   availability under our revolving credit facility and other internal sources of cash flow will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for at least the next months  including debt repayments  commitments to our existing companies and funds  possible additional funding of existing partner companies and our general corporate requirements 
our acquisition of new partner company interests is always contingent upon our availability of cash to fund such deployments  and our timing of monetization events directly affects our availability of cash

in the opinion of management  the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb clarified how an entity should measure the fair value of liabilities and that restrictions which prevent the transfer of a liability should not be considered as separate inputs or adjustments in the measurement of the liability s fair value 
the guidance reaffirms the measurements concept of determining fair value based on an orderly transaction between market participants even though liabilities are infrequently transferred due to contractual or other legal restrictions 
the guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued a single source of authoritative non governmental united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  referred to as the codification 
the codification does not change current us gaap  but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative us gaap by providing all the authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place 
all existing accounting standard documents have been superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the codification is considered non authoritative 
the codification was effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  the codification did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued guidance which required disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods as well as in annual financial statements 
the guidance requires those disclosures in summarized financial statements at interim reporting periods 
the guidance requires that an entity disclose in the body or in the accompanying notes of its financial information the fair value of all financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value  whether recognized or not recognized in the statement of financial position 
in addition  an entity is required disclose the method s and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments 
we adopted the provisions of this guidance on june  and have provided the necessary additional disclosures 
in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on certain matters associated with equity method accounting 
the eitf retained the accounting for the initial carrying value of equity method investments which is based on a cost accumulation model and generally excludes contingent consideration 
the eitf also specified that other than temporary impairment testing by the investor should be performed at the investment level and that a separate impairment assessment of the underlying assets is not required 
an impairment charge by the investee should result in an adjustment of the investor s basis of the impaired asset for the investor s pro rata share of such impairment 
in addition  the eitf reached a consensus on how to account for an issuance of shares by an investee that reduces the investor s ownership share of the investee 
an investor should account for such transactions as if it had sold a proportionate share of its investment with any gains or losses recorded through earnings 
the eitf also addressed the accounting for a change in an investment from the equity method to the cost method 
the eitf affirmed the existing guidance  which requires cessation of the equity method of accounting and application of debt and equity security accounting  or the cost method  as appropriate 
the guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  this consensus did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the eitf clarified how to determine whether certain instruments or features were indexed to an entity s own stock 
the consensus was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after 
table of contents december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of the consensus did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued guidance on the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash or partially in cash upon conversion 
an issuer of convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features is required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument 
the debt is recognized at the present value of its cash flows discounted using the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
the equity component is recognized as the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the note and the fair value of the liability 
the resultant debt discount is to be accreted over the expected life of the debt 
the guidance did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements because the convertible senior debentures previously issued by us do not include any cash settlement features within the scope of this guidance 
see note regarding the exchange of a portion of our senior debentures 
in april  the fasb issued guidance that addresses the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful lives for intangible assets 
the guidance requires an entity to consider its own historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements  regardless of whether those arrangements have explicit renewal or extension provisions  when determining the useful life of an intangible asset 
in the absence of such experience  an entity shall consider the assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension  adjusted for entity specific factors 
the guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb revised the accounting for business combinations 
under the new accounting  an acquiring entity is required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date at fair value with limited exceptions 
the accounting treatment for certain specific items was revised as follows acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests formerly known as minority interests are valued at fair value at the acquisition date  acquired contingent liabilities are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non acquired contingencies  in process research and development ipr d is recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally affect income tax expense 
the revised guidance also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
the revised guidance is applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  in december  the fasb issued new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  the guidance requires the recognition of noncontrolling interests minority interests as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the guidance clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in deconsolidation are treated as equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest that exceed its basis in the subsidiary s equity result in a deficit noncontrolling interest reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
revenue  expenses  gains  losses  net income or loss are reported in the consolidated statements of operations at the consolidated amounts  which include the amounts attributable to the owners of the parent and noncontrolling interest 
the amount of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on 
table of contents the deconsolidation date 
expanded disclosures are also required regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
the guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after november  on january   we adopted the provisions of this guidance 
as a result  we reflect the portion of equity net assets of our consolidated partner companies  if any  not attributable  directly or indirectly  to the parent company as a noncontrolling interest within equity  separate from the equity of the parent company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of our ownership interests in our partner companies 
at december   these interests include our equity position in clarient  our only publicly traded partner company  which has experienced significant volatility in its stock price 
historically  we have not attempted to reduce or eliminate our market exposure related to these interests 
based on closing market prices at december   the fair market value of our holdings in clarient was approximately million 
a decrease in clarient s stock price would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our holdings in clarient 
in february  we completed the issuance of million of our debentures with a stated maturity of march  through december   we repurchased million in face value of the debentures 
interest payments of approximately million are due in march and september of each year 
the holders of these debentures have the right to require repurchase of the debentures on march   march  or march  at a repurchase price equal to of their face amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
fair after value at liabilities december  debentures due by year in millions fixed interest rate n a interest expense in millions n a on march   we entered into agreements with institutional holders of an aggregate of million in face value of our debentures to exchange the debentures held by such holders for million in face amount of newly issued senior convertible debentures  due see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have historically had very low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and as such  have not used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuation risk 
we maintain cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities with various financial institutions 
the financial institutions are highly rated
