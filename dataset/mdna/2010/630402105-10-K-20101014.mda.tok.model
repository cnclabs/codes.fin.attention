item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company is a diversified manufacturer of security products  encompassing intrusion and fire alarms  building access control systems and electronic locking devices 
these products are used for commercial  residential  institutional  industrial and governmental applications  and are sold worldwide principally to independent distributors  dealers and installers of security equipment 
international sales accounted for approximately and of our revenues for the fiscal years ended june  and respectively 
the company owns and operates manufacturing facilities in amityville  new york and the dominican republic 
a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed  and do not fluctuate with changes in production levels or utilization of our manufacturing capacity 
as production levels rise and factory utilization increases  the fixed costs are spread over increased output  which should improve profit margins 
conversely  when production levels decline our fixed costs are spread over reduced levels  thereby decreasing margins 
on august   the company acquired substantially all of the assets and business of g 
marks hardware  inc marks for million  the repayment of million of bank debt and the assumption of certain current liabilities 
the company also entered into a lease for the building where marks has maintained its operations 
the lease provided for an annual base rent of  plus maintenance and real estate taxes and expired in august in march  the company began to move the marks operations into its existing facilities 
the company completed the majority of this consolidation by august  the marks business involves the manufacturing and distribution of door locking devices 
the security products market is characterized by constant incremental innovation in product design and manufacturing technologies 
generally  the company devotes of revenues to research and development r d on an annual basis 
products resulting from our r d investments in fiscal did not contribute materially to revenue during this fiscal year  but should benefit the company over future years 
in general  the new products introduced by the company are initially shipped in limited quantities  and increase over time 
prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as products and technologies mature 
economic and other factors since october  the us and international economies have experienced a significant downturn and continue to be very volatile 
in the event that the downturn in the us or international financial markets is prolonged  our revenue  profit and cashflow levels could be materially adversely affected in future periods 
this could affect our ability to maintain adequate financing 
if the current worldwide economic downturn continues  many of our current or potential future customers may experience serious cash flow problems and as a result may  modify  delay or cancel purchases of our products 
additionally  customers may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us 
furthermore  the current downturn and market instability makes it difficult for us to forecast our revenues 
seasonality the company s fiscal year begins on july and ends on june historically  the end users of napco s products want to install its products prior to the summer  therefore sales of its products historically peak in the period april through june  the company s fiscal fourth quarter  and are reduced in the period july through september  the company s fiscal first quarter 
to a lesser degree  sales in europe are also adversely impacted in the company s first fiscal quarter because of european vacation patterns  ie  many distributors and installers are closed for the month of august 
in addition  demand is affected by the housing and construction markets 
the severity of the current economic downturn may also affect this trend 
restructuring costs in march  the company began a restructuring plan consisting of a series of actions to consolidate its sales  production and warehousing operations of marks and those in europe and the middle east into the corporate headquarters in amityville  ny and its production facility in the dominican republic 
we expect these restructuring initiatives to cost between  and  the majority of these initiatives have been completed by june   while certain remaining production related actions are expected to be completed by december  accordingly  the company recognized restructuring costs of  in the fiscal year ended june  of this amount   relates to workforce reductions communicated in march and  to business exits and related costs associated with inventory and lease impairments related to the closure of the marks  european and middle east facilities 
as of june    of the  in restructuring costs has been incurred and  remains in accrued expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements 
these judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  concentration of credit risk  inventories  intangible assets  goodwill  and income taxes 
revenue recognition revenues from merchandise sales are recorded at the time the product is shipped or delivered to the customer pursuant to the terms of sale 
we report our sales levels on a net sales basis  which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual returns received and an amount established for anticipated returns and other allowances 
our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales and income 
this accrual is calculated based on a history of gross sales and actual sales returns  as well as management s estimate of anticipated returns and allowances 
as a percentage of gross sales  sales returns  rebates and allowances were and for fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
concentration of credit risk an entity is more vulnerable to concentrations of credit risk if it is exposed to risk of loss greater than it would have had if it mitigated its risk through diversification of customers 
such risks of loss manifest themselves differently  depending on the nature of the concentration  and vary in significance 
the company had two customers with accounts receivable balances that aggregated and of the company s accounts receivable at june  and  respectively 
sales to neither of these customers exceeded of net sales in any of the past three fiscal years 
in the ordinary course of business  we have established a reserve for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of  and  as of june  and  respectively 
our reserve for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings 
this reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable agings  specific exposures and historical trends 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost being determined on the first in  first out fifo method 
the reported net value of inventory includes finished saleable products  work in process and raw materials that will be sold or used in future periods 
inventory costs include raw materials  direct labor and overhead 
the company s overhead expenses are applied based  in part  upon estimates of the proportion of those expenses that are related to procuring and storing raw materials as compared to the manufacture and assembly of finished products 
these proportions  the method of their application  and the resulting overhead included in ending inventory  are based in part on subjective estimates and approximations and actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  the company records an inventory obsolescence reserve  which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value  based on various product sales projections 
this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age  historical trends  requirements to support forecasted sales  and the ability to find alternate applications of its raw materials and to convert finished product into alternate versions of the same product to better match customer demand 
there is inherent professional judgment and subjectivity made by both production and engineering members of management in determining the estimated obsolescence percentage 
for the fiscal years and  net charges and balances in these reserves amounted to  and  and  and  respectively 
in addition  and as necessary  the company may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 
the company also regularly reviews the period over which its inventories will be converted to sales 
any inventories expected to convert to sales beyond months from the balance sheet date are classified as non current 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis 
those intangible assets that are classified as goodwill or as other intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized 
impairment testing is performed in two steps i the company determines impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  and ii if there is an impairment  the company measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
at the conclusion of fiscal  the company performed its annual impairment evaluation required by this standard and determined that the goodwill relating to its alarm lock and continental subsidiaries was impaired 
accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal which represents the unamortized balance of this goodwill 
at the conclusion of the quarter ended march   the company performed an interim impairment evaluation and determined that its remaining goodwill  relating to its marks subsidiary  was impaired 
accordingly  in the quarter ended march  the company recorded an impairment charge of  which represented the unamortized balance of this goodwill 
the company s acquisition of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of marks included intangible assets with a fair value of  on the date of acquisition 
the company recorded the estimated value of  related to the customer relationships   related to a non compete agreement and  related to the marks trade name within intangible assets 
the remaining excess of the purchase price of  was assigned to goodwill 
the intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of twenty years customer relationships and seven years non compete agreement 
the marks usa trade name was deemed to have an indefinite life 
the goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition is deductible for federal and new york state income tax purposes over a period of years 
income taxes the company adopted the provisions of asc as of july  the company has identified its us federal income tax return and its state return in new york as its major tax jurisdictions 
as a result the company increased its accrued income tax liability by  from  to  to provide for additional reserves for uncertain income tax positions for us federal and state income tax purposes 
the fiscal and forward years are still open for examination 
the increase in the accrued income tax liability of  was offset in part by a  increase to a deferred income tax asset  resulting in a net reduction to retained earnings of  representing the cumulative effect of adopting asc 
during the year ending june  the company decreased its reserve for uncertain income tax positions by  as of june  the company has a long term accrued income tax liability of  the company s practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense and accrued income taxes 
as of june   the company had accrued interest totaling  and  of unrecognized net tax benefits including the related accrued interest and net of the related deferred income tax benefit of  that  if recognized  would favorably affect the company s effective income tax rate in any future period 
for the year ended june   the company recognized a net benefit to income tax expense of   liability reversal including interest  less the related  reversal of deferred tax asset  plus current year interest accrual on other reserves of 
a reconciliation of the us federal statutory income tax rate to our actual effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes for fiscal is as follows dollars in thousands of pre amount tax income tax at federal statutory rate  increases decreases in taxes resulting from meals and entertainment state income taxes  net of federal income tax benefit foreign source income and taxes  stock based compensation expense tax reserve reversal other  net effective tax rate  liquidity and capital resources the company s cash on hand combined with proceeds from operating activities during fiscal were adequate to meet the company s capital expenditure needs and debt obligations 
the company s primary internal source of liquidity is the cash flow generated from operations 
the primary source of financing related to borrowings under an  secured revolving credit facility 
as of june   was outstanding under this revolving line of credit 
the company expects that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet its short term liquidity requirements 
as of june   the company s unused sources of funds consisted principally of  in cash 
the company plans to utilize  of this cash to pre pay two payments on its term loan as described below 
on august   the company and its banks amended and restated the existing  revolving credit agreement 
the amended facility was  and provides for a  revolving credit line as well as a  term portion of which the entire  was utilized to finance the asset purchase agreement as described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the amended revolving credit agreement and term loan was amended in june to  and is secured by the accounts receivable  a portion of inventory  the company s headquarters building in amityville  new york  certain other assets of napco security technologies  inc and the common stock of three of the company s subsidiaries 
as of june  the company was not in compliance with several of the financial covenants in the existing facilities for which it anticipates receiving the appropriate waivers from its banks as part of therestatement of these facilities as described below 
the company and its banks have been in negotiations to amend and restate the existing terms of the credit facilities and term loan 
as of the date ofthis report  the company and its banks have agreed in principle on all the key terms and modifications to the existing revolving credit agreement and term loan 
because the closing and final waivers will occur after the filing date of this form k  the company has classified this debt as current in the accompanying financial statements 
upon completion of the closing this debt will be reclassified as long term in future filings 
while the company anticipates consummating these restated facilities  there can be no assurances that it will do so 
the agreement would provide for an accelerated payment  made at closing  consisting of the december and march installments totaling  and restructured financial covenants 
the restated agreements also would contain various modifications and conditions and bear interest based on either the prime rate or an alternate rate based on libor as described in the agreement 
the termination dates of the agreements would remain unchanged 
the revolving credit agreement terminates in august and any outstanding borrowings are to be repaid or refinanced on or before that time 
as of june  there was  outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an interest rate of and  outstanding under the term loan with an interest rate of 
the term loan is being repaid in quarterly installments of  each  which commenced in december  and a final payment of  due in august the agreements contain various restrictions and covenants including  among others  restrictions on payment of dividends  restrictions on borrowings and compliance with certain financial ratios  as defined in the restated agreement 
management believes that current working capital and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund the company s operations through at least the first quarter of fiscal the company takes into consideration a number of factors in measuring its liquidity  including the ratios set forth below as of june  current ratio to to sales to receivables to to total debt to equity 
to 
to as of june   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures or inventory purchases other than purchase orders issued in the normal course of business 
on april   the company s foreign subsidiary entered into a year land lease of approximately acres of land in the dominican republic  at an annual cost of approximately  on august   the company  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with marks  acquired substantially all of the assets and business for million  the repayment of million of bank debt and the assumption of current liabilities 
the marks business involves the manufacturing and distribution of door locking devices 
the company funded the acquisition with a term loan from its lenders as described above 
the acquisition described above has been accounted for as a purchase and was valued based on management s estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the estimates of fair value were subject to adjustment for a period of up to one year from the date of acquisition  and such adjustments were not material 
costs in excess of identifiable net assets acquired were allocated to goodwill in the first quarter of fiscal this goodwill was written off in the quarter ended march  working capital 
working capital decreased by  to  at june  from  at june  the decrease in working capital was primarily the result of the classification of the company s outstanding debt under its term loan as a current liability  as discussed above 
the outstanding debt under the term loan was classified as a non current liability as june  working capital is calculated by deducting current liabilities from current assets 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable decreased by  to  at june  from  at june  this decrease resulted primarily from the company granting shorter payment terms to its customers and  consequently  faster collections of accounts receivables 
inventories 
inventories decreased by  to  at june  as compared to  at june  the decrease in inventory levels was primarily the result of the company utilizing existing inventory and scheduling its component purchases and production of finished products more closely with sales levels 
accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by  to  as of june  as compared to  at june  this increase is primarily due to increased purchases of raw materials during the quarter ended june  as compared to june   which was primarily the result of the higher sales levels in the quarter ended june  as compared to the same quarter a year ago

interest expense for fiscal increased by  to  from  for the same period a year ago 
the increase in interest expense is primarily the result of the increase in interest rates charged by the company s primary banks as partially offset by the company s reduction of its outstanding borrowings under its term loan

forward looking information this annual report on form k and the information incorporated by reference may include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the exchange act of the company intends the forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements 
all statements regarding the company s expected financial position and operating results  its business strategy  its financing plans and the outcome of any contingencies are forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are based on current estimates and projections about our industry and our business 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth or implied by any forward looking statements 
for example  the company is highly dependent on its chief executive officer for strategic planning 
if he is unable to perform his services for any significant period of time  the company s ability to grow could be adversely affected 
in addition  factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the ability to maintain adequate financing to fund operations  adverse tax consequences of offshore operations  significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the dominican peso and the us dollar  distribution problems  unforeseen environmental liabilities  the uncertain economic  military and political conditions in the world and the successful integration of marks into our existing operations 
the company s risk factors are discussed in more detail in item a 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal financial instrument is debt consisting of a revolving credit facility and a term loan that provides for interest at a spread above the prime rate 
the company is affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable by the company under this credit facility 
at june   an aggregate principal amount of approximately  was outstanding under the company s credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
if principal amounts outstanding under the company s credit facility remained at this year end level for an entire year and the prime rate increased or decreased  respectively  by the company would pay or save  respectively  an additional  in interest that year 
a significant number of foreign sales transactions by the company are denominated in us dollars 
as such  the company has shifted foreign currency exposure onto many of its foreign customers 
as a result  if exchange rates move against foreign customers  the company could experience difficulty collecting unsecured accounts receivable  the cancellation of existing orders or the loss of future orders 
the foregoing could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company transacts certain sales in europe in british pounds sterling  therefore exposing itself to a certain amount of foreign currency risk 
management believes that the amount of this exposure is immaterial 
we are also exposed to foreign currency risk relative to expenses incurred in dominican pesos rd  the local currency of the company s production facility in the dominican republic 
the result of a strengthening in the us dollar to our rd expenses would result in an annual decrease in income from operations of approximately
