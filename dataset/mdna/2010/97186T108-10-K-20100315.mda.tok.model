item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
community reinvestment act under the community reinvestment act  or cra  as implemented by the congress in  a financial institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with its safe and sound operation  to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with cra 
cra requires federal examiners  in connection with the examination of a financial institution  to assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution 
cra also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
the bank has a compliance committee  which oversees the planning of products and services offered to the community  especially those aimed to serve low and moderate income communities 
the fdic rated the bank as outstanding in meeting community credit needs under cra at its most recent examination for cra performance 

table of contents consumer laws and regulations in addition to the laws and regulations discussed herein  the bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks 
while the list set forth herein is not exhaustive  these laws and regulations include the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the expedited funds availability act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair housing act  the real estate settlement and procedures act  the fair credit reporting act and the federal trade commission act  among others 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers 
the bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing customer relations 
permissible activities and subsidiaries california law permits state chartered commercial banks to engage in any activity permissible for national banks 
therefore  the bank may form subsidiaries to engage in the many so called closely related to banking or non banking activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries  and further  pursuant to glba  the bank may conduct certain financial activities in a subsidiary to the same extent as may a national bank  provided the bank is and remains well capitalized  well managed and in satisfactory compliance with cra 
presently  the bank does not have any financial subsidiaries 
in september  the us securities and exchange commission  or sec  and the federal reserve board finalized joint rules required by the financial services regulatory relief act of to implement exceptions provided in the glba for securities activities that banks may conduct without registering with the sec as a securities broker or moving such activities to a broker dealer affiliate 
the federal reserve board s final regulation r provides exceptions for networking arrangements with third party broker dealers and authorities  including sweep accounts to money market funds  and with related trust  fiduciary  custodial and safekeeping needs 
the final rules  which were effective starting in  are not expected to have a material effect on the bank as it does not have any securities activities 
interstate branching under current law  california state banks are permitted to establish branch offices throughout california with prior regulatory approval 
in addition  with prior regulatory approval  banks are permitted to acquire branches of existing banks located in california 
finally  california state banks generally may branch across state lines by merging with banks in other states if allowed by the applicable states laws 
with limited exceptions  california law currently permits branching across state lines through interstate mergers resulting in the acquisition of a whole california bank that has been in existence for at least five years 
under the federal deposit insurance act  states may opt in and allow out of state banks to branch into their state by establishing a new start up branch in the state

the bank currently has branches located in the states of california  texas  new jersey and new york 
federal home loan bank system the federal home loan bank system  or the fhlb  of which the bank is a member  consists of regional fhlbs governed and regulated by the federal housing finance board  or the fhfb 
the fhlbs serve as reserve or credit facilities for member institutions within their assigned regions 
they are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb 
table of contents system 
they make loans ie  advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the fhlb and the boards of directors of each regional fhlb 
as a system member  the bank is entitled to borrow from the fhlb of san francisco  or fhlb sf  and is required to own capital stock in the fhlb sf in an amount equal to the greater of of the membership asset value  not exceeding million  or of outstanding fhlb sf advance borrowings 
the bank is in compliance with the stock ownership rules described above with respect to such advances  commitments and letters of credit and home mortgage loans and similar obligations 
all loans  advances and other extensions of credit made by the fhlb sf to the bank are secured by a portion of the bank s mortgage loan portfolio  certain other investments and the capital stock of the fhlb sf held by the bank 
mortgage banking operations the bank is subject to the rules and regulations of fnma with respect to originating  processing  selling and servicing mortgage loans and the issuance and sale of mortgage backed securities

the bank is also subject to regulation by the california department of financial institutions  with respect to  among other things  the establishment of maximum origination fees on certain types of mortgage loan products 
future legislation and economic policy we cannot predict what other legislation or economic and monetary policies of the various regulatory authorities might be enacted or adopted or what other regulations might be adopted or the effects thereof 
future legislation and policies and the effects thereof might have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of loans  investments and deposits and affect interest rates charged on loans or paid from time and savings deposits 
such legislation and policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue 
capital requirements holding company and bank 
holding at december   the company s and the bank s capital ratios exceed the minimum percentage requirements for well capitalized institutions 
see note and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and capital adequacy requirements for further information regarding the regulatory capital guidelines as well as the company s and the bank s actual capitalization as of december  the federal banking agencies have adopted risk based minimum capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks which are intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and transactions which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
the risk based capital ratio is determined by classifying assets and certain off balance sheet financial instruments into weighted categories  with higher levels of capital being required for those categories perceived as representing greater risk 
under the capital guidelines  a banking organization s total capital is divided into three tiers 
the first  tier i capital includes common equity and trust preferred securities subject to certain criteria and quantitative limits 
the second  tier ii capital includes hybrid capital 
table of contents instruments  other qualifying debt instruments  a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses  and a limited amount of unrealized holding gains on equity securities 
lastly  tier iii capital consists of qualifying unsecured debt 
the sum of tier ii and tier iii capital may not exceed the amount of tier i capital 
the risk based capital guidelines require a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier i capital to risk weighted assets of 
an institution s risk based capital  leverage capital  and tangible capital ratios together determine the institution s capital classification 
an institution is treated as well capitalized if its total capital to risk weighted assets ratio is or more  its core capital to risk weighted assets ratio is or more  and its core capital to adjusted average assets ratio is or more 
in addition to the risk based guidelines  the federal bank regulatory agencies require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier i capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a banking organization rated well capitalized  the minimum leverage ratio of tier i capital to total assets must be 
the current risk based capital guidelines are based upon the capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision 
a new international accord  referred to as basel ii  which emphasizes internal assessment of credit  market and operational risk  supervisory assessment and market discipline in determining minimum capital requirements  currently becomes mandatory for large international banks outside the us in  is optional for others  and must be complied with in a parallel run for two years along with the existing basel i standards 
in july  the expanded basel committee issued a final measure to enhance the three elements of the basel ii framework  strengthening the rules governing trading book capital issued in the measure includes enhancements to the basel ii structure and revises the market risk framework and guidelines for calculating capital figures 
the us banking agencies have indicated  however  that they will retain the minimum leverage requirement for all us banks 
the federal deposit insurance act fdia gives the federal banking agencies the additional broad authority to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions that fall within any undercapitalized category  including requiring the submission of an acceptable capital restoration plan 
the federal banking agencies have also adopted non capital safety and soundness standards to assist examiners in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired 
the guidelines set forth operational and managerial standards relating to i internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  ii loan documentation  iii credit underwriting  iv asset quality and growth  v earnings  vi risk management  and vii compensation and benefits 
item a 
risk factors the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report 
additional risks and uncertainties are discussed elsewhere in this report 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the events described in these risks 
if a significant number of clients fail to perform under their loans  our business  profitability  and financial condition would be adversely affected 
as a lender  one of the largest risks we face is the possibility that a significant number of our client borrowers will fail to pay their loans when due 
if borrower defaults cause losses in excess of our allowance for loan losses  it could have an adverse effect on our business  profitability  and financial condition 
we have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of the 
table of contents allowance for loan losses 
although this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information  the classification of loans and the establishment of loan losses are dependent to a great extent on our experience and judgment 
although we believe that our allowance for loan losses is at a level adequate to absorb any inherent losses in our loan portfolio  we cannot assure you that we will not further increase the allowance for loan losses or that regulators will not require us to increase this allowance 
increases in our allowance for loan losses could materially affect our earnings adversely 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and non performance 
our allowance for loan losses is based on prior experience  as well as an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio 
however  actual loan losses could increase significantly as the result of changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  which are generally beyond our control 
thus  such losses could exceed our current allowance estimates 
either of these occurrences could materially affect our earnings adversely 
in addition  the fdic and the dfi  as an integral part of their respective supervisory functions  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such regulatory agencies may require us to increase our provision for losses on loans and loan commitments or to recognize further loan charge offs  based upon judgments different from those of management 
any increase in our allowance required by the fdic or the dfi could adversely affect us 
banking organizations are subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance 
a major portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings  and the interest rates we receive on interest earning assets  such as loans we extend to our clients and securities held in our investment portfolio 
net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans  and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations 
in  federal reserve board reduced the federal funds rate seven times 
as of january   the federal funds rate was 
by december   the federal funds rate had been reduced to current rate of to 
the series of reductions in the federal funds rate during effectively lowered our average interest rate for and  which resulted in lower average yield rates compared to the interest rate ranges for and were to and to  respectively 
because of the declining national economy and continued financial crisis  the credit markets are lacking liquidity 
while the federal funds rate and other short term market interest rates decreased substantially  the intermediate and long term market interest rates  which are used by many banking organizations to guide loan pricing  have not decreased proportionately 
this has led to a steepening of the market yield curve with short term rates considerably lower than long term notes 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to minimize our interest rate risk 
in addition  while a decrease in the general level of interest rates may improve the ability of certain borrowers with variable rate loans to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations  it reduces our interest income  and may lead to an increase in competition among banks for deposits 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread  net interest margin and our overall profitability 

table of contents liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations  meet our obligations as they become due and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business 
liquidity risk is the potential that the bank will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory actions against us 
market conditions or other events could also negatively affect the level or cost of funding  affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals  meet contractual obligations  and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost  in a timely manner and without adverse consequences 
although management has implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions  any substantial  unexpected and or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the profitability of wilshire bancorp is dependent on the profitability of the bank 
because wilshire bancorp s principal activity is to act as the holding company of the bank  the profitability of wilshire bancorp is largely dependent on the profitability of the bank 
the bank operates in an extremely competitive banking environment  competing with a number of banks and other financial institutions which possess greater financial resources than those available to the bank  in addition to other independent banks 
in addition  the banking business is affected by general economic and political conditions  both domestic and international  and by government monetary and fiscal policies 
conditions such as inflation  recession  unemployment  high interest rates  short money supply  scarce natural resources  international terrorism and other disorders as well as other factors beyond the control of the bank may adversely affect its profitability 
banks are also subject to extensive governmental supervision  regulation and control  and future legislation and government policy could adversely affect the banking industry and the operations of the bank 
wilshire bancorp relies heavily on the payment of dividends from the bank 
the bank is the only source of significant income for wilshire bancorp 
accordingly  the ability of wilshire bancorp to meet its debt service requirements and to pay dividends depends on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to it 
however  the bank is subject to regulations limiting the amount of dividends that it may pay to wilshire bancorp 
for example  any payment of dividends by the bank is subject to the fdic s capital adequacy guidelines 
all banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to total risk weighted assets of  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital  and a ratio of tier capital to average adjusted assets of 
if i the fdic increases any of these required ratios  ii the total of risk weighted assets of the bank increases significantly  and or iii the bank s income decreases significantly  the bank s board of directors may decide or be required to retain a greater portion of the bank s earnings to achieve and maintain the required capital or asset ratios 
this will reduce the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends by the bank to wilshire bancorp 
further  in some cases  the fdic could take the position that it has the power to prohibit the bank from paying dividends if  in its view  such payments would constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices 
in addition  whether dividends are paid and their frequency and amount will depend on the financial condition and performance  and the discretion of the board of directors of the bank 
the foregoing 
table of contents restrictions on dividends paid by the bank may limit wilshire bancorp s ability to obtain funds from such dividends for its cash needs  including funds for payment of its debt service requirements and operating expenses and for payment of cash dividends to wilshire bancorp s shareholders 
the amount of dividends the bank could pay to wilshire bancorp as of december  without prior regulatory approval  which is limited by statute to the sum of undivided profits for the current year plus net profits for the preceding two years less any distributions made to shareholders during such periods  was million 
the holders of recently issued debentures and series a preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders 
in december  the bank issued an aggregate of million of junior subordinated debentures  at times referred to in this report as the junior subordinated debentures or the debentures 
in addition  in the past three years  wilshire bancorp  as a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank in and as a parent company of the bank in and  issued an aggregate of  of junior subordinated debentures as part of the issuance of  in trust preferred securities by statutory trusts wholly owned by wilshire bancorp 
the purpose of these transactions was to raise additional capital 
these junior subordinated debentures are senior in liquidation rights to our outstanding shares of common stock and our series a preferred stock 
the terms of these junior subordinated debentures also restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock at any time we are in default under  or with respect to the junior subordinated debentures issued in  or  have exercised our right to defer interest payments under the indentures governing these junior subordinated debentures 
as a result  in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holder of these junior subordinated debentures must be paid in full before any liquidating distributions may be made to the holders of our common and preferred stock 
if we default under the terms of these junior subordinated debentures or utilize our right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures issued in  or  no dividends may be paid to holders of our common and preferred stock for so long as we remain in default or have deferred amounts remaining unpaid 
on december   the company issued  in series a preferred stock and a warrant to the us treasury as part of the us treasury s capital purchase program or cpp 
this million investment from the us treasury  which is commonly referred to as troubled assets relief program tarp investment  was part of the government strategy to counter the ongoing financial crisis and the possible prolonged economic downturn 
the tarp investment was made to us in exchange for our  shares of our series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase initially  shares of our common stock 
the preferred shareholder  the us treasury  has preference with respect to dividends and liquidation over our common shareholders 
similar to the junior subordinated debentures  if we default the payment of dividends on our series a preferred stock  no dividends may be paid to holders of our common stock for so long as we remain in default or have deferred amounts remaining unpaid 
because we are substantially dependent on dividends from the bank in order to make the periodic payments due under the terms of the junior subordinated debentures issued in  and  and the terms of the series a preferred stock issued in  in the event that the bank is unable to pay dividends to wilshire bancorp for any significant period of time  then we may be unable to pay the amounts due to the holders of these junior subordinated debentures and the us treasury 
our failure to meet the challenges of successfully integrating the acquired mirae bank could potentially harm the operations of our combined organization 
our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the acquired mirae assets with ours or otherwise to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could harm the 
table of contents results of operations of our combined organization 
the integration of the business of two banks can be a complex  time consuming and expensive process that  without proper planning and implementation  could disrupt our business 
the challenges involved in this integration include the following demonstrating to the customers of mirae bank and the customers of wilshire state bank that the acquisition will not result in adverse changes in client service standards or business focus and helping customers conduct business easily with the combined banks  consolidating and rationalizing corporate information technology and administrative infrastructures  coordinating sales and marketing efforts and strategies to effectively communicate the capabilities of the combined organization  especially to former mirae bank customers  persuading employees that the business cultures of wilshire state bank and the former mirae bank are compatible  maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees  and managing a complex integration process 
adverse changes in domestic or global economic conditions  especially in california  could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  and profitability 
if economic conditions worsen in the domestic or global economy  especially in california  our business  growth and profitability are likely to be materially adversely affected 
a substantial number of our clients are geographically concentrated in california  and adverse economic conditions in california  particularly in the los angeles area  could harm the businesses of a disproportionate number of our clients 
to the extent that our clients underlying businesses are harmed  they are more likely to default on their loans 
we can provide no assurance that conditions in the california economy and in the economies of other areas where we operate will not deteriorate further in the future and that such deterioration will not adversely affect us 
continuing negative developments in the financial industry and us and global credit markets may affect our operations and results 
negative developments in the us financial market  its real estate section  and the securitization markets for the mortgage loans have resulted in uncertainty in the overall economy both domestically and globally 
commercial as well as consumer loan portfolio performances have deteriorated at many institutions and the competition for deposits and quality loans has increased significantly 
in addition  the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages have substantially declined and may continue to further decline 
bank and bank holding company stock prices generally have been negatively affected as has the ability of banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets compared to recent years 
was a record year for bankruptcies and bank failures 
as a result  there is a potential for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards  and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  including the expected issuance of many formal enforcement orders 
negative developments in the financial industry and the impact of new legislation in response to those developments could negatively affect our operations by restricting our business operations  including our ability to originate or sell loans  and adversely affect our financial performance 
governmental responses to recent market disruptions may be inadequate and may have unintended consequences 
in response to recent market disruptions  legislators and financial regulators have taken a number of steps to stabilize the financial markets 
these steps include the enactment and partial 
table of contents implementation of the emergency economic stabilization act of  the provision of other direct and indirect assistance to distressed financial institutions  assistance by the banking authorities in arranging acquisitions of weakened banks and broker dealers  implementation of programs by the federal reserve to provide liquidity to the commercial paper markets and expansion of deposit insurance coverage 
the new administration and congress have pursued additional initiatives in an effort to stimulate the economy and stabilize the financial markets  including the recent enactment of the american recovery and reinvestment act of and the passage of a billion federal stimulus bill  and have altered the terms of some previously announced policies 
the overall effects of these and other legislative and regulatory efforts on the financial markets are uncertain 
should these or other legislative or regulatory initiatives fail to stabilize the financial markets  our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
our operations may require us to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available or may not be on terms acceptable to us when it is needed 
we are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
we believe that our existing capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future and will be sufficient to offset any problem assets 
however  should our asset quality erode and require significant additional provision  resulting in consistent net operating losses at the bank  our capital levels will decline and we will need to raise capital 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot be certain of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired 
the short term and long term impact of the new basel ii capital standards and the forthcoming new capital rules to be proposed for non basel ii us banks is uncertain 
as a result of the continued deterioration in the global credit markets and the potential impact of increased liquidity risk and interest rate risk  it is unclear what the short term impact of the implementation basel ii may be or what impact a pending alternative standardized approach to basel ii option for non basel ii us banks may have on the cost and availability of different types of credit and the potential compliance costs of implementing the new capital standards 
maintaining or increasing our market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services 
our success depends  in part  upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer demand 
there is increasing pressure on financial services companies to provide products and services at lower prices 
in addition  the widespread adoption of new technologies  including internet based services  could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products or services 
a failure to achieve market acceptance of any new products we introduce  or a failure to introduce products that the market may demand  could have an adverse effect on our business  profitability  or growth prospects 
significant reliance on loans secured by real estate may increase our vulnerability to downturns in the california real estate market and other variables impacting the value of real estate 
at december   approximately of our loans were secured by real estate  a substantial portion of which consist of loans secured by real estate in california 
conditions in the california real estate market historically have influenced the level of our non performing assets 
a real estate recession in southern california could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  california 
table of contents has experienced  on occasion  significant natural disasters  including earthquakes  brush fires and flooding attributed to the weather phenomenon known as el nino 
in addition to these catastrophes  california has experienced a moderate decline in housing prices beginning in late the decline in housing prices subsequently developed into the current financial crisis  characterized by the further decline in the real estate market in many parts of the country  including california  starting in the second half of  and the failures of many financial institutions in and the availability of insurance to compensate for losses resulting from such crises is limited 
the occurrence of one or more of such crises could impair the value of the collateral for our real estate secured loans and adversely affect us 
if we fail to retain our key employees  our growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
our future success depends in large part upon the continuing contributions of our key management personnel 
if we lose the services of one or more key employees within a short period of time  we could be adversely affected 
our future success is also dependent upon our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
competition for such employees among financial institutions in california is intense 
our inability to attract and retain additional key personnel could adversely affect us 
in november  our former executive vice president and chief financial officer  resigned 
following his resignation  we engaged his replacement in april in addition  our senior vice president and controller  was promoted to senior vice president and deputy chief financial officer in conjunction with the appointment of our new chief financial officer 
furthermore  effective january   our former president and chief executive officer retired 
however  in connection with his retirement  we have entered into a consulting agreement providing for his continued service as an advisor for the bank until may following the retirement of our former chief executive officer  we promoted our previous executive vice president and chief lending officer to the position of president and chief executive officer  and our prior executive vice president and sba manager  was promoted to chief lending officer 
for as long as we have shares of series a preferred stock outstanding in connection with the us treasury s voluntary tarp capital purchase program  we will be subject to the limitations on compensation included in eesa and arra 
these restrictions may make it more difficult for us to retain certain of our key officers and employees because competitors who are not subject to the same restrictions may be able to offer more competitive salaries and or benefits to these individuals 
more information about the compensation limitations of eesa and aara can be found in the section entitled supervision and regulation tarp capital purchase program in item of this report 
we may be unable to manage future growth 
we may encounter problems in managing our future growth 
our total assets at december    and were billion  billion  and billion  respectively  representing an increase of million  or in  and million  or in we currently intend to consider additional de novo branches and lpos and to investigate opportunities to acquire or combine with other financial institutions that would complement our existing business  as such opportunities may arise and be consistent with our deliberate expansion strategy 
no assurance can be provided  however  that we will be able to identify a suitable acquisition target or consummate any such acquisition 
further  our ability to manage growth will depend primarily on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  monitor operations  maintain earnings  and control costs 
any failure by us to accomplish these goals could risk interruptions in our business plans and could also adversely affect current operations 

table of contents our expenses will increase as a result of increases in fdic insurance premiums 
the fdic imposes an assessment against institutions for deposit insurance 
this assessment is based on the risk category of the institution 
federal law requires that the designated reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund be established by the fdic at a of estimated insured deposits 
if this reserve ratio drops below  the fdic must  within days  establish and implement a plan to restore the designated reserve ratio to of estimated insured deposits within five years absent extraordinary circumstances 
recent bank failures coupled with deteriorating economic conditions have significantly reduced the deposit insurance fund s reserve ratio 
as a result of this reduced reserve ratio  on october   the fdic adopted a restoration plan that would restore the reserve ratios to its required level of over a seven year period 
there have also been increases in fdic assessments resulting from its recently announced temporary liquidity guaranty program 
if the economy continues to decline  the fdic premiums may continue to increase in the future 
continued increases in fdic insurance premiums m have an adverse effect on our earnings depleting capital reserves 
we could be liable for breaches of security in our online banking services 
fear of security breaches could limit the growth of our online services 
we offer various internet based services to our clients  including online banking services 
the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is essential to maintain our clients confidence in our online services 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect client transaction data 
although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to prevent security breaches and periodically test our security  failure to mitigate breaches of security could adversely affect our ability to offer and grow our online services and could harm our business 
people generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet and any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth of the internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
our ability to provide financial services over the internet would be severely impeded if clients became unwilling to transmit confidential information online 
as a result  our operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our directors and executive officers beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock 
as of february   our directors and executive officers  together with their respective affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding voting common stock not including vested option shares 
as a result  such shareholders may have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions  such as a merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
we can provide no assurance that the investment objectives of such shareholders will be the same as our other shareholders 
the market for our common stock is limited  and potentially subject to volatile changes in price 
the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuation in response to numerous factors  including variations in our annual or quarterly financial results or those of our competitors  changes by financial research analysts in their evaluation of our financial results or those of our competitors  or our failure or that of our competitors to meet such estimates  conditions in the economy in general or the banking industry in particular  or unfavorable publicity affecting us or the banking industry 
in addition  the equity markets have  on occasion  experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies securities and have been 
table of contents unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
in addition  the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
further  the issuance or registration by us of any significant amount of additional shares of our common stock will have the effect of increasing the number of outstanding shares or  in the case of registrations  the number of shares of our common stock that are freely tradable  any such increase may cause the market price of our common stock to decline or fluctuate significantly 
any such fluctuations may adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock 
we may experience impairment on goodwill 
in light of the overall instability of the economy  the continued volatility in the financial markets  the downward pressure on bank stock prices and expectations of financial performance for the banking industry  including the company  our estimates of goodwill fair value may be subject to change or adjustment and we may determine that impairment charges are necessary 
estimates of fair value are determined based on a complex model using cash flows and company comparisons 
if management s estimates of future cash flows are inaccurate  the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment may not be recognized in a timely manner 
if the company s market capitalization falls below book value  we will update our valuation analysis to determine whether goodwill is impaired 
no assurance can be given that goodwill will not be written down in future periods 
we face substantial competition in our primary market area 
we conduct our banking operations primarily in southern california 
increased competition in our market may result in reduced loans and deposits 
ultimately  we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
many competitors offer the same banking services that we offer in our service area 
these competitors include national banks  regional banks and other community banks 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including without limitation  savings and loan institutions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  credit unions  mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries 
in particular  our competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns 
additionally  banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger customers 
areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits  efforts to obtain deposits  and range and quality of products and services provided  including new technology driven products and services 
technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services 
we also face competition from out of state financial intermediaries that have opened low end production offices or that solicit deposits in our market areas 
if we are unable to attract and retain banking customers  we may be unable to continue our loan growth and level of deposits and our results of operations and financial condition may otherwise be adversely affected 
anti takeover provisions of our charter documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management 
certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could discourage unsolicited takeover proposals not approved by the board of directors in which shareholders could receive a premium for their shares  thereby potentially limiting the opportunity for our shareholders to dispose of their shares at the higher price generally available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal or may have the effect of permitting our current management  including the current 
table of contents board of directors  to retain its position  and place it in a better position to resist changes that shareholders may wish to make if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of our business 
the anti takeover measures included in our articles of incorporation and bylaws  include  without limitation  the following the elimination of cumulative voting  the adoption of a classified board of directors  super majority shareholder voting requirements to modify certain provisions of the articles of incorporation and bylaws  and restrictions on certain business combinations with third parties who may acquire our securities outside of an action taken by us 
we are subject to significant government regulation and legislation that increases the cost of doing business and inhibits our ability to compete 
we are subject to extensive state and federal regulation  supervision and legislation  all of which is subject to material change from time to time 
these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and have an adverse impact on our ability to compete efficiently with other financial service providers that are not similarly regulated 
changes in regulatory policies or procedures could result in management s determining that a higher provision for loan losses would be necessary and could cause higher loan charge offs  thus adversely affecting our net earnings 
there can be no assurance that future regulation or legislation will not impose additional requirements and restrictions on us in a manner that could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows  financial condition and prospects 
as a participant in the tarp capital purchase program  we have agreed to various requirements and restrictions imposed by the us treasury on all participants  which included a provision that the u 
s 
treasury could change the terms of participation at any time 
further information regarding the current requirements and restrictions imposed on tarp participants can be found under the caption regulation and supervision the tarp capital purchase program in item of this report 
we could be negatively impacted by downturns in the south korean economy 
many of our customers are locally based korean americans who also conduct business in south korea 
although we conduct most of our business with locally based customers and rely on domestically located assets to collateralize our loans and credit arrangements  we have historically had some exposure to the economy of south korea in connection with certain portions of our loans and credit transactions with korean banks 
such exposure has consisted of discounts of acceptances created by banks in south korea  advances made against clean documents presented under sight letters of credit issued by banks in south korea  advances made against clean documents held for later presentation under letters of credit issued by banks in south korea  and extensions of credit to borrowers in the us secured by letters of credit issued by banks in south korea 
we generally enter into any such loan or credit arrangements  in excess of  and of longer than days  only with the largest of the korean banks and spread other lesser or shorter term loan or credit arrangements among a variety of medium sized korean banks 

table of contents as a result of the economic crisis in south korea in the mid s  management has continued to closely monitor our exposure to the south korean economy and the activities of korean banks with which we conduct business 
to date  we have not experienced any significant loss attributable to our exposure to south korea 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that our efforts to minimize exposure to downturns in the south korean economy will be successful in the future  and another significant downturn in the south korean economy could possibly result in significant credit losses for us 
in addition  due to our customer base being largely made up of korean americans  our deposit base could significantly decrease as a result of deterioration in the korean economy 
for example  some of our customers businesses may rely on funds from south korea 
further  our customers may temporarily withdraw deposits in order to transfer funds and benefit from gains on foreign exchange and interest rates  and or to support their relatives in south korea during downturns in the korean economy 
a significant decrease in our deposits could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additional shares of our common stock issued in the future could have a dilutive effect 
shares of our common stock eligible for future issuance and sale could have a dilutive effect on the market for our stock 
our articles of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of common stock 
as of february   there were approximately  shares of our common stock issued and outstanding   shares of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the wilshire bancorp  inc stock option plan  or the stock option plan   shares of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock are reserved for issuance upon exercise of the warrant that we issued to the us treasury in connection with our participation in the tarp capital purchase program  plus an additional  shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance to the holders of stock options previously granted and still outstanding under the wilshire state bank stock option plan  or the stock option plan 
thus  approximately  shares of our common stock remain authorized not reserved for stock options and are available for future issuance and sale at the discretion of our board of directors 
shares of our preferred stock previously issued and preferred stock issued in the future could have dilutive and other effects 
on december   we received  from the us treasury as part of the federal government s capital purchase program 
in exchange for the federal funding  we issued  shares of series a preferred stock  each with a stated liquidation amount of  per share  to the us treasury 
as of february   there were of  shares of our series a preferred stock that were issued and outstanding 
shares of our preferred stock eligible for future issuance and sale also could have a dilutive effect on the market for the shares of our common stock  especially because of the fact that the preferred shares would have seniority with respect to our common stock 
in addition to  shares of common stock  our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of  shares of preferred stock 
as of december   the total number of shares of authorized but unissued preferred stock was  the board of directors could authorize the issuance of such preferred shares at any time in the future 
if such shares of preferred stock are made convertible into shares of common stock  there could be a dilutive effect on the shares of common stock then outstanding 
in addition  shares of preferred stock may be provided a preference over holders of common stock upon our liquidation or with respect to the payment of dividends  in respect of voting rights or in the redemption of our capital stock 
the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions applicable to any series of preferred stock may be determined by resolution of our board of directors without the need for shareholder approval

dividends as a california corporation  we are restricted under the california general corporation law  or cgcl  from paying dividends under certain conditions 
our shareholders are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by our board of directors  out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends  as provided in the cgcl 
the cgcl provides that a corporation may make a distribution to its shareholders if retained earnings immediately prior to the dividend payout at least 
table of contents equal the amount of proposed distribution 
in the event that sufficient retained earnings are not available for the proposed distribution  a corporation may  nevertheless  make a distribution  if it meets both the quantitative solvency and the liquidity tests 
in general  the quantitative solvency test requires that the sum of the assets of the corporation equal at least times its liabilities 
the liquidity test generally requires that a corporation have current assets at least equal to current liabilities  or  if the average of the earnings of the corporation before taxes on income and before interest expenses for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of the interest expense of the corporation for such fiscal years  then current assets must be equal to at least times current liabilities 
in certain circumstances  we may be required to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve board to make capital distributions to our shareholders 
it has been our general practice to retain earnings for the purpose of increasing capital to support growth  and no cash dividends were paid to shareholders prior to however  we began paying a cash dividend to our common shareholders beginning in the first quarter of while we currently pay cash dividends on our common stock  as well as to the holders of our series a preferred stock pursuant to our agreements under the tarp capital purchase program  all dividends are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors  including future earnings  financial condition  cash needs and general business conditions 
any dividend to our common shareholders must also comply with the restrictions in our outstanding junior subordinated debentures and our series a preferred stock described earlier in this report  as well as applicable bank regulations 
the following table shows cash dividends to our common shareholders declared by wilshire bancorp the two years ended december  declaration date payable date record date amount february  april  march  per share may  july  june  per share september  october  september  per share december  january  december  per share february  april  march  per share may  july  june  per share august  october  september  per share november  january  december  per share the following table shows cash dividends to us treasury for our preferred stocks for the year ended december  date paid period rate amount paid february  dec  feb   may  feb  may   august  may  aug   november  aug  nov   our ability to pay cash dividends in the future will depend in large part on the ability of the bank to pay dividends on its capital stock to us 
the ability of the bank to pay dividends on its common stock is restricted by the california financial code  the fdia  and fdic regulations 
in general terms  california law provides that the bank may declare a cash dividend out of net profits up to the lesser of retained earnings or net income for the last three fiscal years less any distributions made to shareholders during such period  or  with the prior written approval of the commissioner of department of financial institutions  in an amount not exceeding the greatest of retained earnings  
table of contents net income for the prior fiscal year  or net income for the current fiscal year 
the bank s ability to pay any cash dividends will depend not only upon our earnings during a specified period  but also on our meeting certain capital requirements 
the fdia and fdic regulations restrict the payment of dividends when a bank is undercapitalized  when a bank has failed to pay insurance assessments  or when there are safety and soundness concerns regarding a bank 
the payment of dividends by the bank may also be affected by other regulatory requirements and policies  such as maintenance of adequate capital 
if  in the opinion of the regulatory authority  a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in  or is about to engage in  an unsafe or unsound practice which  depending on the financial condition of the depository institution  could include the payment of dividends  such authority may require  after notice and hearing  that such depository institution cease and desist from such practice 
securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans in june  we established the stock option plan that provides for the issuance of restricted stock and options to purchase up to  shares of our authorized but unissued common stock to employees  directors  and consultants 
exercise prices for options may not be less than the fair market value at the date of grant 
compensation expense for awards is recorded over the vesting period 
under the stock option plan  there were stock options outstanding to purchase  shares of our common stock as of december  during  the bank established the stock option plan  which provided for the issuance of up to  shares of the company s authorized but unissued common stock to managerial employees and directors 
due to the expiration of the plan in february  no additional options may be granted under the stock option plan 
accordingly  no shares of our common stock remain available for future issuance under the stock option plan 
nonetheless  there are  shares of our common stock reserved for issuance to the holders of stock options previously granted and still outstanding under the stock option plan 
the following table summarizes information as of december  relating to the number of securities to be issued upon the exercise of the outstanding options under the plan and the plan and their weighted average exercise price 
number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options  warrants  and rights weighted average exercise price of outstanding options  warrants  and rights number of securities available for future issuance under equity compensation plans excluding securities reflected in column a a b c equity compensation plans approved by security holders equity compensation plans not approved by security holders total equity compensation plans future grants of stock options under the plan may be subject to the limitations of eesa for as long as shares of our series a preferred stock are outstanding 
eesa prohibits us from accruing any bonus  retention award  or incentive compensation to at least the five most highly compensated employees of the company or such higher number of employees as the us treasury may determine 
although the interpretation of what specifically constitutes incentive compensation is not clear  it is likely that we will not be able to grant additional stock options to at least our five most highly compensated employees during the time that we have shares of series a preferred stock outstanding

executive overview introduction wilshire bancorp  inc succeeded to the business and operations of wilshire state bank the bank upon consummation of the reorganization of the bank into a holding company structure  effective as of august  prior to the completion of the reorganization  the bank was subject to the information  reporting  and proxy statement requirements of the exchange act  pursuant to the regulations of its primary regulator  the fdic 
accordingly  the bank filed annual and quarterly reports  proxy statements  and other information with the fdic 
pursuant to rule g of the exchange act  the company has succeeded to the reporting obligations of the bank and the reporting obligations of the bank to the fdic have terminated 
filings by the company under the exchange act  like this form k  are to be made with the sec 
note that while we refer generally to the company throughout this filing  all references to the company prior to august   except where otherwise indicated  are to the bank 
we operate a community bank in the general commercial banking business  with our primary market encompassing the multi ethnic population of the los angeles metropolitan area 
our full service offices are located primarily in areas where a majority of the businesses are owned by korean speaking immigrants  with many of the remaining businesses owned by hispanic and other minority groups 
at december   we had approximately billion in assets  billion in total loans  and billion in deposits 
we also have expanded and diversified our business geographically by focusing on the continued development of the east coast market 
in may  we completed the acquisition of liberty bank of new york liberty and its merger into the bank 
with this acquisition  we added million in total assets and two branches in new york city 
we paid million for this transaction  which consisted of million in cash and million in our common stock  shares 
we also incurred merger related costs of  which we recognized as additional consideration in connection with this business combination 
in july  we acquired a branch of royal bank america rba in fort lee  new jersey in exchange for our branch at flushing  new york 
in this branch exchange transaction  we purchased selected fixed assets and assumed selected liabilities  including a portion of the bank s time deposits 
as consideration  we transferred to rba selected intangible and fixed assets  and selected liabilities  including a portion of time deposits  intangible liabilities  and lease obligations 
the amounts involved in this transaction were insignificant except for the time deposits exchanged 
in the branch exchange transaction  both parties transferred deposit liabilities in the amount of approximately million 
the branch exchange transaction was accounted for as an exchange of assets and liabilities 
the fort lee  new jersey loan portfolio has grown to million as of december   as compared with the prior year end 
deposit growth at the fort lee branch has also exceeded our expectation  and increased to million as of december   as compared with the prior year end 
subsequent to the branch exchange in july  we opened a new bayside branch in new york to compensate for the loss of our flushing branch 
however  in a branch in flushing  new york was opened which resulted in further expansion of our banking service and market coverage in the state of new jersey and the greater new york city metropolitan area 
similar to the new jersey fort lee 
table of contents branch  the loan portfolio of our four new york branches including fort lee has grown to million at december  from after the acquisition of liberty bank of new york 
our deposit portfolio in the new york branches has also experienced significant growth  up over from million at the time of the acquisition to million at the end of in addition to our expansion into the new york new jersey area  we further expanded our banking network within the state of california 
in august  we opened our new city center branch office in los angeles  california 
to improve operating efficiency  we also merged a market branch in rancho cucamonga  california  into a neighboring branch in the same city during december on june   we acquired the banking operations of mirae bank from the fdic  who had been named receiver of the institution 
we acquired approximately million in assets and assumed million in liabilities 
this included million in loans  and million in deposits in addition to five branch offices 
the integration of former mirae was successfully completed in the third quarter of  during which out of the branches were closed as a result of their close proximity to our office locations 
even with the branch closures  the retention rate for former mirae deposit customers remained high 
over the past several years  our network of branches and lpos has expanded geographically 
we currently maintain twenty three branch offices and five lpos 
we believe that our market coverage complements our multi ethnic small business focus 
we intend to be cautious about our growth strategy in future years regarding opening of additional branches and lpos 
we expect to continue implementing our growth strategy using planning and market analysis  and as our needs and resources permit 
in december  the bank issued million of the junior subordinated debentures 
subsequently  the company  as a wholly owned subsidiary in and as a parent company of the bank in and  issued a total of  of junior subordinated debentures in connection with a  trust preferred securities issuance by statutory trusts wholly owned by the company 
we believe that the supplemental capital raised in connection with the issuance of these debentures allowed us to achieve and maintain our status as a well capitalized institution and sustained our continued loan growth 
in december  we issued  shares of newly designated series a preferred stock  each with a stated liquidation amount of  per share  and an attached warrant exercisable initially for  shares of our common stock  with an exercise price of per share  to the us treasury in exchange for the us treasury s million investment in the tarp capital purchase program 
this additional capital infusion from the united states government further strengthened our capital ratios  allowing us to continue to assist the financial markets with much needed liquidity via careful lending to qualified borrowers 
as evidenced by our past several years of operations  we have experienced significant balance sheet growth 
we have implemented a strategy of building our core banking foundation by focusing on commercial loans and business transaction accounts 
our management believes that this strategy has created recurring revenue streams  diversified our product portfolio and enhanced shareholder value 
key performance indicators we believe the following were key indicators of our performance for our operations during our total assets grew to billion at the end of  or an increase of from billion at the end of our total deposits grew to billion at the end of  or an increase of from billion at the end of 
table of contents our total loans grew to billion at the end of  or an increase of from billion at the end of total net interest income increased to million in  or an increase of from million in the increase in net interest income was a result of decrease in deposit  fhlb advances  and other borrowing expenses 
total noninterest income increased to million in  or an increase of from million in a large portion of the increase is attributable to a gain of million as a result of the mirae bank acquisition 
however  not including the gain from the acquisition  noninterest income increased by due to increases in gains that resulted from the sales of securities and loans 
total noninterest expense increased to million in or from million in the increase is mainly due to an increase in our fdic deposit insurance premium  premise expense  and other expenses as a result of our growth 
nonetheless  due to our continuous efforts in minimizing operating expenses  noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets were lowered to in from in our efficiency ratio the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income before provision for losses on loans and loan commitments and total noninterest income improved by over  decreasing to at  compared to an efficiency ratio of for the net income available for common shareholders for decreased to million or per diluted common share  as compared with million  or per diluted common share in the decrease in net income is primarily attributable to higher than expected provisions for losses on loans and loan commitments in compared to  provisions increased by million to million in the increase in provisions for losses on loans and loan commitments is a result of credit quality issues and management s proactive stance to address these credit concerns as quickly as possible through sales  charge offs  modifications  and resolutions with customers 
outlook although the economic indicators point towards modest growth and economic expansion in  we will continue to take a cautious approach on our outlook for as a result of downturns in the commercial and residential real estate market  assets quality on cre loans contributed to our higher delinquency and non accrual rates in we expect this trend to continue in however  management has taken proactive approach by acquiring updated appraisals on cre loan collateral and stress testing cre loans during we believe the commercial real estate market may face increased deterioration  although not at the level experienced in and on a micro economic level within our own business  we plan to continue to focus on management of our net interest margin and the resolution of credit issues 
notwithstanding the overall national economy  we believe that there will be slower but continual economic growth in our niche market areas  which includes the korean american business sectors located in southern california  texas  new jersey  and the greater new york city metropolitan area 
we expect that this growth will be mainly attributable to an anticipated capital influx from the republic of korea because of the successful passage of the republic of korea united states free trade agreement in october  and admission of korea into the united states visa waiver program in november accordingly  we therefore believe that we will continue to grow  but assume that such growth will be at a more controlled pace than we have experienced in the past 
the reduction in our growth rate is expected to result in a healthier balance sheet  as we expect to see fewer non performing loans 
hence  our asset base is expected to be of better quality with more core deposits than we experienced in 
table of contents we will continue to consider opportunities for growth in our existing markets  as well as opportunities to expand into new markets through de novo branching and regional lpos 
one of our strategies for growth in the futures lies with the east coast branches 
we continue to experience steady growth in this region and we believe that the east coast will be a critical part of our planned expansion strategy  especially in the east coast market of the us because of its high level of small business activity and diverse population 
in addition  we will continue to focus on streamlining our operations so that our expenses do not outpace the overall growth of our business 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  and has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions  and other subjective assessments 
in particular  we have identified several accounting policies that  due to judgments  estimates  and assumptions inherent in those policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the classification and valuation of investment securities  the methodologies that determine our allowance for loan losses  the treatment of non accrual loans  the valuation of properties acquired through foreclosure  the valuation of retained interests and mortgage servicing assets related to the sales of sba loans  and the treatment and valuation of stock based compensation and business combination 
in each area  we have identified the variables most important in the estimation process 
we have used the best information available to make the estimates necessary to value the related assets and liabilities 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key variables could change future valuation and impact net income 
investment securities our investment policy seeks to provide and maintain liquidity  and to produce favorable returns on investments without incurring unnecessary interest rate or credit risk  while complementing our lending activities 
our investment securities portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may cause actual prepayments to vary from the estimated prepayments over the life of a security 
this may result in adjustments to the amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts related to these instruments  consequently changing the net yield on such securities 
reinvestment risk is also associated with the cash flows from such securities 
the unrealized gain loss on such securities may also be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 
under asc  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and recorded at amortized cost 
securities not classified as held to maturity or trading  with readily determinable fair values  are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value 
purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the estimated lives of the securities 
the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in notes and of the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report under asc  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based 
table of contents partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise 
investment securities that are classified as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized or are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
the fair values of investment securities are generally determined by reference to market prices obtained from an independent external pricing service provider 
in obtaining such valuation information from third parties  we have evaluated the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values 
we perform an analysis on the broker quotes received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value 
the procedures include  but are not limited to  initial and on going review of third party pricing methodologies  review of pricing trends  and monitoring of trading volumes 
we ensure whether prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of internal and external cash flow models developed based on spreads  and when available  market indices 
as a result of this analysis  if we determine there is a more appropriate fair value based upon the available market data  the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly 
prices from third party pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions 
as a result  certain securities are priced via independent broker quotations which utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market based data 
additionally  the majority of these independent broker quotations are non binding 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
impairments related to credit issued must be recognized in current earnings rather than in other comprehensive income 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process  requiring the use of judgment and assumptions 
we examine all individual securities that are in an unrealized loss position at each reporting date for other than temporary impairment 
specific investment related factors we examine to assess impairment include the nature of the investment  severity and duration of the loss  the probability that we will be unable to collect all amounts due  and analysis of the issuers of the securities and whether there has been any cause for default on the securities and any change in the rating of the securities by the various rating agencies 
additionally  we evaluate whether the creditworthiness of the issuer calls the realization of contractual cash flows into question 
we reexamine the financial resources  intent  and the overall ability of the company to hold the securities until their fair values recover 
management does not believe that there are any investment securities  other than those identified in the current and previous periods  which are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as of december  investment securities are discussed in more detail in note and of our consolidated financial statements presented later in this report 
as required under financial accounting standards board fasb asc which was previously emerging issues task force eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interest in securitized financial assets  and eitf  amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 
 we consider all available information relevant to the collectability of the security  including information about past events  current conditions  and reasonable and supportable forecasts  when developing the estimate of future cash flows and making its other than temporary impairment assessment for our portfolio of residual securities and pooled trust preferred securities 
we consider factors such as remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  the financial condition of the issuer s  expected defaults  and the value of any underlying collateral 

table of contents as of december  and december   no investment securities were determined to have any other than temporary impairment 
the unrealized losses on our government sponsored enterprises gse bonds  collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  and mortgage backed securities mbs are attributable to both changes in interest rates and a repricing risk in the market 
all gse bonds  gse cmo  and gse mbs securities are backed by us government sponsored and federal agencies and therefore rated aaa 
we have no exposure to the subprime market in the form of asset backed securities abs and collateralized debt obligations cdos that had previously been rated aaa but have since been downgraded to below investment grade 
we have the intent and ability to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position at december  and until the market value recovers or the securities mature 
municipal bonds and corporate bonds are evaluated by reviewing the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market conditions 
the unrealized losses on our investment in municipal and corporate securities were primarily attributable to both changes in interest rates and a repricing risk in the market 
we have the intent and ability to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position at december  and until the market value recovers or the securities mature 
small business administration loans certain sba loans that may be sold prior to maturity have been designated as held for sale at origination and are recorded at the lower of cost or market value  determined on an aggregate basis 
a valuation allowance is established if the market value of such loans is lower than their cost  and operations are charged or credited for valuation adjustments 
when we sell a loan  we usually sell the guaranteed portion of the loan and retain the non guaranteed portion 
we receive sales proceeds from i the guaranteed principal of the loan  ii the deferred premium for the difference between the book value of the retained portion and the fair value allocated to the retained portion  and iii the loan excess servicing fee esf 
at the time of sale  the deferred premium  which is amortized over the remaining life of the loan as an adjustment to yield  is recorded for the difference between the book value and the fair value allocated to the retained portion 
the sales gain is recognized from the difference between the proceeds and the book value allocated to the sold portion 
we allocate the book value of the related loans among three portions on the basis of their relative fair value i the sold portion  ii the retained portion  and iii the esf 
we estimate the fair value of each portion based on the following 
the amount received for the sale represents the fair value of the sold portion 
the fair value of the retained portion is computed by discounting its future cash flows over the estimated life of the loan 
we calculate the fair value of the esf for the loan from the cash in flow of the net servicing fee over the estimated life of the loan  discounted at an above average discount rate and a range of constant prepayment rates of the related loans 
we capitalize the fair value allocated to esf in two categories i intangible servicing assets the contracted servicing fee less normal servicing costs  and ii interest only strip  or i o strip  receivables excess of esf over the contracted servicing fee 
the servicing asset is recorded based on the present value of the contractually specified servicing fee  net of servicing cost  over the estimated life of the loan  with an average discount rate and a range of constant prepayment rates of the related loans 
prior to december   the servicing asset was amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated servicing income 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the servicing assets are stratified by collateral types 
management periodically evaluates the fair value of servicing assets for impairment 
a valuation allowance is recorded when the fair value is below the carrying amount and a recovery of the valuation allowance is recorded when its fair value exceeds the carrying amount 
however  a reversal may not exceed the original valuation allowance recorded 
on january   we adopted asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  and selected a fair value measurement method to measure our servicing assets and liabilities and recognized a onetime increase in their fair value of  net of tax effects 
any subsequent increase or decrease 
table of contents in fair value of servicing assets and liabilities is to be included in our current earnings in the statement of operations 
an interest only strip is recorded based on the present value of the excess of future interest income  over the contractually specified servicing fee  calculated using the same assumptions as noted above 
interest only strips are accounted for at their estimated fair value  with unrealized gains recorded as an adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
if the estimated fair value is less than its carrying value  the loss is considered as other than temporary impairment and it is charged to the current earnings 
allowance for loan losses accounting for the allowance for loan losses involves significant judgment and assumptions by management and is based on historical data and management s view of the current economic environment 
at least on a quarterly basis  our management reviews the methodology and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and reports its assessment to the board of directors for its review and approval 
we base our allowance for loan losses on an estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
our methodology for assessing loan loss allowances is intended to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses and involves a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio in three phases the specific review of individual loans in accordance with asc formerly statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  the segmenting and reviewing of loan pools with similar characteristics in accordance with asc sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and our judgmental estimate based on various qualitative factors 
the first phase of our allowance analysis involves the specific review of individual loans to identify and measure impairment 
at this phase  we evaluate each loan except for homogeneous loans  such as automobile loans and home mortgages 
specific risk rated loans are deemed impaired with respect to all amounts  including principal and interest  which will likely not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the related loan agreement 
impairment for commercial and real estate loans is measured either based on the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows or  if collection on the loan is collateral dependent  the estimated fair value of the collateral  less selling and holding costs 
the second phase involves segmenting the remainder of the risk rated loan portfolio into groups or pools of loans  together with loans with similar characteristics for evaluation in accordance with asc we perform loss migration analysis and calculate the loss migration ratio for each loan pool based on its historical net losses and benchmark it against the levels of other peer banks 
in the third phase  we consider relevant internal and external factors that may affect the collectability of a loan portfolio and each group of loan pools 
as a general rule  the factors listed below will be considered to have no impact to our loss migration analysis 
however  if information exists to warrant adjustment to the loss migration ratios  the changes will be made in accordance with the established parameters and supported by narrative and or statistical analysis 
we use a credit risk matrix to determine the impact to the loss migration analysis 
this matrix enables management to adjust the general allocation based on the loss migration ratio 
the factors currently considered are  but are not limited to concentration of credit  delinquency trend  nature and volume of loan trend  non accrual and problem loan trends  loss and recovery trend  quality loan review  lending and management staff  lending policies and procedures  and external factors such as changes in legal and regulatory requirements  on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio 
for all factors  the extent of the adjustment will be commensurate with the severity of the conditions that concern each 
table of contents factor 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these factors is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio components 
central to our credit risk management and our assessment of appropriate loss allowance is our loan risk rating system 
under this system  the originating credit officer assigns borrowers an initial risk rating based on a thorough analysis of each borrower s financial capacity in conjunction with industry and economic trends 
approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit administration personnel 
credits are monitored by line and credit administration personnel for deterioration in a borrower s financial condition which may impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract 
although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loans  specific loan pools  including off balance sheet credit exposures which are reported separately as part of other liabilities  the adequacy of the allowance is considered in its entirety 
non accrual loan policy interest on loans is credited to income as earned and is accrued only if deemed collectible 
accrual of interest is discontinued when a loan is over days delinquent unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
generally  payments received on nonaccrual loans are recorded as principal reductions 
interest income is recognized after all principal has been repaid or an improvement in the condition of the loan has occurred that would warrant resumption of interest accruals 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo  which represents real estate acquired through foreclosure  or deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of commercial and real estate loans  is carried at the estimated fair value less the selling costs of the real estate 
the fair value of the property is based upon a current appraisal 
the difference between the fair value of the real estate collateral and the loan balance at the time of transfer is recorded as a loan charge off if fair value is lower than the loan balance 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations and the oreo property is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value  less cost to sell 
the determination of a property s estimated fair value incorporates i revenues projected to be realized from disposal of the property  ii construction and renovation costs  iii marketing and transaction costs  and iv holding costs eg  property taxes  insurance and homeowners association dues 
any subsequent declines in the fair value of the oreo property after the date of transfer are recorded through a write down of the asset 
any subsequent operating expenses or income  reduction in estimated fair values  and gains or losses on disposition of such properties are charged or credited to current operations 
bank owned life insurance boli obligation under asc formerly eitf  accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements  an employer is required to recognize obligations associated with endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements that extend into the participant s post employment benefit cost for the continuing life insurance or based on the future death benefit depending on the contractual terms of the underlying agreement 
asc is effective as of the beginning of the entity s first fiscal year after december  we adopted asc on january  using the latter option based on the future death benefit 
upon this adoption  we recognized increases in the liability for unrecognized post retirement obligations of  and  for directors and officers  respectively  as a cumulative adjustment to our current year s beginning equity 
during the year of  the increases in boli expense and liability related to the adoption of asc was  which was included as 
table of contents part of the other expenses and other liabilities balances in the consolidated financial statements 
boli expenses and liability related to the adoption of asc for amounted to  goodwill and intangible assets we recognized goodwill and intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of liberty bank of new york  and from the mirae bank acquisition 
as of december  goodwill stood unchanged from the previous year at million  all of which is related to the liberty bank acquisition located in the east coast 
million and million  respectively  in core deposits intangibles were recorded as a result of the liberty bank and mirae bank acquisition 
core deposit intangibles had cost bases of million each related to the liberty bank and mirae bank transaction 
in accordance with asc previously sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized  but rather is subject to impairment testing at least annually 
our impairment analysis of goodwill is calculated in accordance with asc using a combination of the market approach and income approach and is discussed in more detail in note we tested goodwill for impairment as of december  and found no impairment adjustment was needed 
income taxes we accounted for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enacted date 
we record net tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to reduce the current period provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rates were often lower than the statutory rates 
this was mainly due to state tax benefits derived from doing business in an enterprise zone and tax preferential treatment for our ownership of boli and low income housing tax credit funds 
in  we adopted the provision of fasb asc formerly financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 which is now codification reference  income taxes 
asc provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination  with a tax examination being presumed to occur 
the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized on examination 
for tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test  no tax benefit is recorded 
as a result of the implementation of the interpretation  the company recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefit of  and no related interest 
as of december   the total unrecognized tax benefit that would affect the effective rate if recognized was  and related interest was 
table of contents stock based compensation we issued stock based compensation to certain employees  officers  and directors 
on january   we adopted asc formerly sfas r  share based payment  for stock based compensation 
asc allows for two alternative transition methods 
we follow the modified prospective method  which requires application of the new statement to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the required effective date 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
additionally  compensation costs for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of january  are recognized as the requisite services are rendered on or after january  the compensation cost of that portion of awards is based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
sba guaranteed loan sales in december  fasb issued accounting standards update asu accounting for transfers of financial assets  to codify fasb statement is revision to statement no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
codified at asc  the guidance requires more information about transfer of financial assets  including securitization transactions and where companies have continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets 
the statement is to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financial position  financial performance and cash flows  and a transferor s continuing involvement  if any  in transferred financial assets 
as of january  implantation date  the guidance has changed the company s categorization of sba guaranteed portions of loans sold to third parties purchasers 
due to the following recourse provisions  sales accounting will not be applied to these transactions if borrower makes the first three payments required by the note after the warranty date the date the agreement is settled by the bank and registered holder through fta in which they are due and the payments are the full amounts required by the note  the bank has no liability to refund the premium 
if the borrower prepays the loan for any reason within the days of the warranty date  the bank must refund any premium received 
if the bank fails to make the first three monthly payments due after the warranty date and the borrower enters uncured default within calendar days from the warranty date  the bank shall refund any premium received 
borrower payments must be received by the bank in the month in which they are due and must be full payments as defined in the borrower s note 
if a transfer of a portion of a loan does not meet the participation definition  the transfer is treated as a secured borrowing with a pledge of collateral 
prior to the issuance of this statement  sba guaranteed portions sold to third parties were treated as loans before and after the sale of the loan as sales accounting treatment was applied 
however under the new guidance  we now classify sba guaranteed portions of loans as secured borrowings 
as a result of the new guidance  the recognition of gain on sale of sba guaranteed loans will be delayed by at least days until the recourse provision expires  and during that period  the loan balances will be grossed up and payment received will be accounted for as secured borrowings 

table of contents results of operations net interest income and net interest margin our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest and fees derived from earning assets and interest paid on liabilities obtained to fund those assets 
our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume changes 
our net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities  referred to as rate changes 
interest rates charged on our loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes  and competitive factors 
those factors are  in turn  affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control  such as federal economic policies  the general supply of money in the economy  legislative tax policies  the governmental budgetary matters  and the actions of the federal reserve board 
our average net loans were billion in  as compared with billion in and billion in  representing similar increases of in and  respectively  from each of the prior annual periods 
average interest earning assets were billion in  as compared with billion in and billion in  representing increases of and in and  respectively  from each of the prior annual periods 
our average interest bearing deposits also increased by to billion in  as compared with billion in  after increasing in from billion in together with other borrowings see financial condition deposits and other sources of funds below  average interest bearing liabilities increased by to billion in  as compared with billion in  after increasing by in from billion in the federal reserve board s rate decreases in resulted in a decrease in our average yield on interest earning assets to in from in since the last rate reduction on december   the current federal funds rate has been to  an unprecedentedly low level and has remained without change throughout accordingly  the average yield on interest earning assets again decreased to in during the same time periods  the rates for deposits in our local markets remained competitive  which required us to closely monitor our cost of funds so that it would be in line with our yield on assets 
our average yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points to in from in and in however  due to balance increases in cre loans and securities  interest income increased to million in  compared to million in interest expense meanwhile  decreased to million in  as compared with million in in  interest income contracted to  as compared with million in interest expense experienced a larger decrease to million or in from million in the combined result of our growth particularly in core deposits  and careful monitoring efforts with respect to cost of funds resulted in an increase in our net interest income 
net interest income before provision for losses on loan and loan commitments increased  or million  to million in  following an increase of  or million in to million from million in as a result of our lowered cost of funds in  our net interest spread slightly increased from in to in  but was still down from in net interest margin continued to deteriorate in decreasing to compared to in and in

net loan fees were approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
loans are net of the allowance for loan losses  deferred fees  unearned income  and related direct costs  but include those placed on non accrual status 
provision for loan losses and provision for loan commitments in anticipation of credit risks inherent in our lending business and the recent ongoing financial crisis  we set aside allowances through charges to earnings 
such charges were made not only for our outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet items  such as commitments to extend credits or letters of credit 
the charges made for our outstanding loan portfolio were credited to allowance for loan losses  whereas charges for off balance sheet items were credited to the reserve for off balance sheet items  which are presented as a component of other liabilities 
although we have enhanced our stringent loan underwriting standards and proactive credit follow up procedures  we experienced a substantial increase of the provision for loan losses because of a weak economy  the continued decline in the real estate market  and increases in loan defaults and foreclosures 
due to aggressive resolution of problem loans through reserves and charge offs in  our provision for loan losses increased to million in from million in the increases in our provisions were primarily to keep pace with the continued growth of our loan portfolio 
table of contents and an increase of non performing loans see nonperforming assets below for further discussion 
the million provision in was net of provision of million to the reserve for loan commitments  while the million and million provisions in and included  in recoveries and million in provisions to the reserve for loan commitments  respectively 
the procedures for monitoring the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  as well as detailed information concerning the allowance itself  are described in the section entitled allowance for loan losses and loan commitments below 
noninterest income total noninterest income increased to million in  as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
noninterest income was of average assets in  an increased from and in and  respectively 
we currently earn noninterest income from various sources  including an income stream provided by bank owned life insurance  or boli  in the form of an increase in cash surrender value 
the following table sets forth the various components of our noninterest income for the periods indicated noninterest income dollars in thousands for the years ended december  amount amount amount gain from acquisition of mirae bank service charges on deposit accounts gain on sale of securities loan related servicing fees gain on sale of loans income from other earning assets other income total average assets noninterest income as a of average assets our largest source of noninterest income in was the gain relating to the acquisition of mirae bank  which represented of total noninterest income 
there were no gains on acquisition recorded in or the million acquisition gain was recorded as a bargain purchase gain which resulted from the difference between the total fair value of assets acquired in the amount of million  less million in fair value of liabilities acquired from the second quarter acquisition of mirae bank 
our services charges on deposits accounted for of total noninterest income  which was the second largest portion of noninterest income and increased to million in  as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in services charges on deposits was primarily due to deposit growth  specifically growth in transaction accounts during we constantly review service charge rates to maximize service charge income while maintaining a competitive edge in our markets 

table of contents our liquidity position continued to remain strong as a result of large increases in core deposits in this allowed us to profit from gains on the sale of securities 
gains from security sales totaled million in  our third largest source of noninterest income at 
the million in securities gains in was a large increase compared to  and  in and  respectively 
the market value of securities have increased in contrast to what we experience in and due to decreased volatility in markets  changes in the yield curve  and contraction of interest rates spreads on securities owned by the bank 
our fourth largest source of noninterest income was loan related servicing fees  which represented approximately of our total noninterest income 
this fee income consists of trade financing fees and servicing fees on sba loans sold 
with the expansion of our trade financing activities and the growth of our servicing loan portfolio  fee income has generally increased 
in  loan related servicing fees increased to million  as compared with million in and million in the servicing fee income on sold loans is credited when we collect the monthly payments on the sold loans we are servicing and charged by the monthly amortization of servicing rights and interest only  or i o strips that we originally capitalized upon sale of the related loans 
such servicing rights and i o strips are also charged against the loan service fee income account when the sold loans are paid off 
gain on sale of loans  representing approximately of our total noninterest income in was our next largest source of noninterest income 
having decreased to million in from million and in  gain on sale of loans figures increased to million in this noninterest income is derived primarily from the sale of the guaranteed portion of sba loans 
we sell the guaranteed portion of sba loans in the secondary market for government securities and retain the associated servicing rights 
due to the weakened economy and ongoing financial crisis  our sba loan production levels decreased to million in as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
gains from the sale of guaranteed portions of sba loans were million at the end of and million at  and million at there were no gain from unguaranteed portions sold in and  compared to million recorded in a loss on loan sales amounting to  was also recorded in  there were no losses on loan sales prior to the large decreased premiums paid for sba guaranteed portions from to  resulted in a lowered sales volumes and market illiquidity 
however  we started to see premiums increasing in gain on sale of loans also includes sales gains on residential mortgage loans 
however  due to the decline of the residential mortgage market  sale transactions of residential mortgage loans were low 
therefore gains related to loan mortgage loan decreased from  in to  in  and rose slightly to  in income on other earning assets represents dividend income from fhlb stock ownership and the increase in the cash surrender value of boli 
these accounted for  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in was primarily due to  decrease in fhlb dividend income  while the cash surrender value of boli increased  similarly in  the  increase in income was also primarily attributable to an additional boli interest and fhlb stock dividends 
other income represented income from miscellaneous sources  such as loan referral fees  sba loan packaging fees  gain on sale of investment securities and excess of insurance proceeds over carrying value of an insured loss that generally increases as our business grows 
other income increased to million in  as compared with million in and million in 
table of contents noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased to million in from million in which previously increased from million in the increases in and were primarily attributable to the increased fdic and state assessments  and increase in premises expense related to opening of new branches  as well increases stemming from balance sheet growth 
although the acquisition of mirae bank in the second quarter increase overall costs  by the end of we were able to reduce expenses related to the acquisition of mirae bank 
due to continuing efforts to minimize operating expenses during our expansion  we were able to reduce noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets to in  as compared with in and in management believes that its efforts in cost cutting and revenue diversification have effectively improved our operational efficiency in despite the weak economic conditions and the acquisition of former mirae bank  our efficiency ratio was improved to in  from in and in the following table sets forth a summary of noninterest expenses for the periods indicated noninterest expense dollars in thousands for the years ended december  amount amount amount salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment deposit insurance premium data processing professional fees amortization of investments in affordable housing partnership advertising and promotional outsourced service for customers post retirement benefit costs office supplies amortization of other intangibles assets communications appraisal fees directors fees investor relation expenses other total average assets noninterest expense as a of average assets salaries and employee benefits historically represent more than half of our total noninterest expense and generally increases as our branch network and business volume expands 
however  in  salaries and benefits accounted for only of total noninterest expense 
although additional staffing was necessitated by our new office openings  business growth  and the acquisition of mirae bank in the past months  we have successfully controlled and maintained our total number of employees through effective allocation of our human resources 
the number of full time equivalent 
table of contents employees increased to at the end of  as compared with and in and  respectively 
even with increases in employees  salaries and employee benefits remained flat at million in  as compared with million in and million in  representing a decrease of less than in and increases of and in and  respectively  over each of the prior year periods 
our steady asset growth helped us increased assets per employee to million  as compared with million and million at the end of  and  respectively 
occupancy and equipment expenses represent approximately of total noninterest expenses and totaled million in  compared to million in and million in  representing increases of and in and  respectively  over each of the prior year periods 
these increases were attributable to the expansion of our office network and the additional office space and lease expenses for our new california and new york branch offices opened in deposit insurance premium expenses represent the financing corporation fico and fdic insurance premium assessments 
in  these expenses increased to million from million in and  in the increase in fdic insurance assessment was primarily a result of the temporary increase in fdic insurance coverage from  to  starting may this increased the insured deposit amount thereby increasing assessment fees associated with covered deposits 
the fdic also levied a special assessment starting june amounting to basis points 
all these factors contributed to the increased assessment fees paid and increased total assessment by from to compared to a increase during the one year period from to data processing expenses increased to million in compared to million in  and increased from million in the increase in data processing in corresponded to the growth of our business as a result of the acquisition of mirae bank 
one time costs associated with the acquisition were expensed in as well 
professional fees generally increase as we grow and we expect these expenditures continue to be significant  as we address the enhanced sec and nasdaq corporate governance requirements and the local regulation of the states into which we expand our business operations 
professional fees were million  million  and million  or   and of total noninterest expense  in  and  respectively 
the  increase in was attributable to the  increase in accounting  audit fees and an increase of  in legal fees related to loan collection  property foreclosure and repossession  and various other legal consultations  and a  increase in fees related to consulting  system test  and various accounting and auditing services 
similarly in  the  increase was mainly attributable to the legal and accounting fees incurred for various legal consultations 
amortization of investments in affordable housing partnerships increased by to million in  and to  in compared to the previous year

advertising and promotional expenses increased to million in from million in  which previously decreased from million in  representing   and of total noninterest expenses in  and  respectively 
these expenses represent marketing activities  such as media advertisements and promotional gifts for customers of newly opened offices  especially in the new areas such as the east coast market in new york and new jersey 
the expenses have remained fairly steady with no large fluctuations from to 
table of contents outsourced service costs for customers are payments made to third parties who provide services that were traditionally provided by banks to their customers  such as armored car services or bookkeeping services  and are recouped from the earnings credits earned by the respective depositors on their balances maintained with us 
due mainly to the increase in service activities and the increase in depositors demanding such services  our outsourced service costs generally rise in proportion with our business growth 
nonetheless  with our successful cost control measures  these expenses decreased to million in  as compared with million in and million in other expense such as post retirement benefit costs  office supplies  amortization of intangible assets  communications  appraisal fees  and investor relations expense all increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
directors fees  however  decreased by or  from  in to  in all these expense were less than of total noninterest expenses at december  other noninterest expense  increased by million  or  to million in from million in a portion of the increase represents a normal growth in association with the growth of our business activities and was in line with our expectation 
however  approximately  was expensed in as a result of operational losses at our branches 
as a result of our cost control efforts  evidenced in our improved efficiency ratio  noninterest expense increased less rapidly at in and in when compared to total assets growth of in and in our successful expansion into the new york new jersey market in the previous years has paved the groundwork for our further expansion into the east coast in and beyond 
although management anticipates that noninterest expense will continue to increase as we continue to grow  we remain committed to cost control and operational efficiency  and we expect to keep these increases to a minimum relative to our rate of growth 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december   we made a provision for income taxes of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of  as compared with a provision for income taxes of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of for  and a provision of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of for the effective tax rate decreased from to  and again from to  due primarily to an increase in low income housing tax credit funds  and lower taxable income 
our lower effective tax rates compared to statutory rates were mainly due to state tax benefits derived from doing business in an enterprise zone and tax preferential treatment for our ownership of boli and low income housing tax credit funds see other earning assets for further discussion 
generally  income tax expense is the sum of two components current tax expense and deferred tax expense benefit 
current tax expense is calculated by applying the current tax rate to taxable income 
deferred tax expense is recorded as deferred tax assets liabilities change from year to year 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects  based on current tax law  of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized in our financial statements 
because we traditionally recognize substantially more expenses in our financial statements than we have been allowed to deduct for taxes  we generally have a net deferred tax asset 
at december   and  we had net deferred tax assets of million  million and million  respectively 
on january   we adopted the provisions of asc formerly fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
as a result of applying the provisions of asc  we recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefit of  and no related interest

we do not expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next months 
as of the december   the total accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions was  we accounted for interest related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for federal and state income taxes 
accrued interest was included as part of our net deferred tax asset in the consolidated financial statements 
we file united states federal and state income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statues of limitations 
the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal and most state tax authorities 
examinations for the and tax years under the california franchise tax board and the new york state department of taxation and finance were completed as of december  we believe that we have adequately provided or paid for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
based upon consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances  we do not expect the examination results will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statement as of december  financial condition investment portfolio investments are one of our major sources of interest income and are acquired in accordance with a comprehensively written investment policy addressing strategies  categories  and levels of allowable investments 
this investment policy is reviewed at least annually by the board of directors 
management of our investment portfolio is set in accordance with strategies developed and overseen by our asset liability committee 
investment balances  including cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  are subject to change over time based on our asset liability funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives 
our liquidity levels take into consideration anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credits and is maintained a level management believes is appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting anticipated funding needs 
cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions we sell federal funds  purchase securities under agreements to resell and high quality money market instruments  and deposit interest bearing accounts in other financial institutions to help meet liquidity requirements and provide temporary holdings until the funds can be otherwise deployed or invested

we did not have any interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions as of december    and investment securities management of our investment securities portfolio focuses on providing an adequate level of liquidity and establishing a balanced interest rate sensitive position  while earning an adequate level of investment income without taking undue risks 
as of december   our investment portfolio was primarily comprised of united states government agency securities  accounting for of the entire investment portfolio 
our us government agency securities holdings are all prime conforming mortgage backed securities  or mbs  and collateralized mortgage obligations  or cmos  guaranteed by fnma  fhlmc  or gnma 
gnmas are considered equivalent to us treasury securities  as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government 
currently  there are no subprime mortgages in our investment portfolio 
besides the us government agency securities  we also have a investment in corporate debt and in municipal debt securities

our investment portfolio does not contain any government sponsored enterprises  or gse  preferred securities or any distressed corporate securities that had required other than temporary impairment charges as of december  in accordance with asc recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  an other than temporary impairment otti is recognized if the fair value of a debt security is lower than the amortized cost and the debt security will be sold  it is more likely than not  that it will be required to sell the security before recovering the amortized cost  or if it is expected that not all of the amortized cost will be recovered 
credit related declines in the fair value of debt securities below their amortized cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
declines related to factors aside from credit issues are reflected in other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
we classified our investment securities as held to maturity or available for sale pursuant to asc sfas no 

we adopted asc sfas no

effective january   and we adopted asc fasb staff position fsp sfas no 
effective october  pursuant to the fair value election option of asc  we have chosen to continue classifying our existing instruments of investment securities as held to maturity or available for sale under asc investment securities that we intend to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity securities  and all other investment securities are classified as available for sale 
the carrying values of available for sale investment securities are adjusted for unrealized gains and losses as a valuation allowance and any gain or loss is reported on an after tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income

the million increase in represented million net purchases  which includes million received as a result of the acquisition of mirae bank  and million unrealized gain 
meanwhile  the million increase in represented million net purchases and million unrealized gain 
these increases reflect a strategy of improving our levels of liquidity using available for sale securities  in addition to immediately available funds which are maintained mainly in the form of overnight investments 
the large increase in was a result of increased liquidity that resulted from the inflow of core deposits

declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses

table of contents prospects of the issuer  and iii our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
we performed detailed evaluation of the investment portfolio in assessing individual positions that have market values that have declined below cost 
in assessing whether there was other than temporary impairment  we considered in a disciplined manner whether or not all contractual cash flows due on a security will be collected  and our positive intent and ability to hold the debt security until recovery in fair value or maturity a number of factors are considered in the analysis  including but not limited to issuer s credit rating  likelihood of the issuer s default or bankruptcy  collateral underlying the security  industry in which the issuer operates  nature of the investment  severity and duration of the decline in fair value  and analysis of the average life and effective maturity of the security 
we do not believe that any individual unrealized loss as of december  represented an other than temporary impairment 
the unrealized losses on our gse bonds  gse cmos  and gse mbs were attributable to both changes in interest rate us treasury curve and a repricing of risk spreads widening against risk fee rate in the market 
we do not own any non agency mbs or cmo 
all gse bonds  gse cmo  and gse mbs securities are backed by us government sponsored and federal agencies and therefore rated aaa aaa 
we have no exposure to the subprime market in the form of asset backed securities  or abs  and collateralized debt obligations  or cdos  that had previously been rated aaa aaa but have since been downgraded to below investment grade 
we have the intent and ability to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position at december  until the market value recovers or the securities mature 
municipal bonds and corporate bonds are evaluated by reviewing the credit worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions

real estate secured loans consist primarily of commercial real estate loans and are extended to finance the purchase and or improvement of commercial real estate and or businesses 
the properties may either be user owned or for investment purposes

consumer loans have historically represented less than of our total loan portfolio 
the majority of consumer loans are concentrated in personal lines of credits

since a major real estate recession during the first part of the previous decade  property values in southern california and around the country have generally increased in the last year span from to since late 
table of contents  we have started to see below trend growth in gross domestic product gdp and a gradual decline of the real estate market in southern california and many other areas in the country 
the financial crisis worsened during the second half of and the first half of and we observed further decline in the real estate market across the nation 
nonetheless  as of year end  of our loans are secured by first mortgages on various types of real estate 
we expect to see the decline in real estate values to continue into the first half of  so with the current economic conditions  no assurance can be given that property values will not decline further in nonperforming assets nonperforming assets  or npas  consist of nonperforming loans  or npls  restructured loans  and other npas 
npls are reported at their outstanding balances  net of any portion guaranteed by sba  and consist of loans on non accrual status and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest 
restructured loans are loans of which the terms of repayment have been renegotiated  resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal 
other npas consist of properties  mainly other real estate owned  or oreo  and repossessed vehicles  acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management intends to offer for sale 
despite the significant growth in our loan portfolio  our continued emphasis on asset quality control enabled us to maintain a relatively low level of npls prior to however  the general economic condition of the us as well as the local economies in which we do business have shown a gradual decline as the housing sector and gdp growth continued to show weakness in and this unfavorable economy environment affected the strength of our borrowers credit and financial status  and our npls  net of sba guaranteed portion  increased to million at the end of  as compared with million  million  million  and million at the end of    and  respectively

additional interest income would be negligible during the year ended december   if this loan had been paid in accordance with its original term and had been outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended december  allowance for loan losses and loan commitments based on the credit risk inherent in our lending business  we set aside allowances through charges to earnings 
such charges were not only made for the outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet loan commitments  such as commitments to extend credit or letters of credit 
charges made for the outstanding loan portfolio were credited to the allowance for loan losses  whereas charges related to loan commitments were credited to the reserve for loan commitments  which is presented as a component of other liabilities 
the provision for losses on loans and loan commitments is discussed in the section entitled provision for loan losses and provision for loan commitments above

with the continued increase of the allowance for loan losses and loan commitments in recent years  we were able to maintain the adequate ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans at     and at the end of     and  respectively

in an effort to provide additional benefits aimed at retaining key employees  while generating a tax exempt noninterest income stream  we purchased million and million in boli during and  respectively  from insurance carriers rated aa or above 
in and  we purchased  and  more in boli from the same insurance carriers 
we are the owner and the primary beneficiary of the life insurance policies and recognize the increase of the cash surrender value of the policies as tax exempt other income 
in  we also invested in several low income housing tax credit funds lihtcf to promote our participation in cra activities 
we committed to invest  over two to three years  a total of million to two different lihtcf million in apollo california tax credit fund xxii  lp  and million in hudson housing los angeles revitalization fund  lp

we then made million additional commitment to invest in hudson housing los angeles revitalization fund iv lp in we receive the returns on these investments  over the fifteen years following the said two to three year investment periods in the form of tax credits and tax deductions 
in  we committed to invest million in wnc institutional tax credit fund x new york series in order to promote our cra activities in the assessment area in new york and million in wnc institutional tax credit fund in order to promote our cra activities in the assessment area in dallas 
during the past year in  we committed to invest million in nht tax credit fund and million in enterprise green communities west fund in order to promote our cra activities in the assessment area in los angeles  california 
as collateral for our fhlb borrowings  we are required by fhlb to invest in fhlb stock 
in  our total additional investment in fhlb stock was million which was recorded as a result of the mirae acquisition 
we received no stock dividends from fhlb but dividends were received in the form of cash from our fhlb stock holdings amounting to  in therefore  the total asset value of the fhlb stock increased million to million as of year end from million in the prior year

the average deposit balances remained about the same between year ends of and however  average deposits increased or million 
in  the average deposit balances increased million  or  from the prior year end 
the increase in deposits is a result of the acquisition of mirae bank  the inflow of deposits from peer institutions  and the due to our expansion in the east coast region of our operations 
deposits acquired from mirae bank totaled million at the time of the acquisition 
as a result of the acquisition  we experienced a large inflow of deposits due to customers perception of our financial strength 
we expect our expansion into the new york new jersey area and more branch coverage within our primary market of southern california to continue to outpace the existing deposit competition 
after  our niche market depositor s preference in time deposits bearing relatively high interest rates decreased the level of deposits in transactional accounts and we increased our reliance on time deposits to fund our loan growth 
despite our efforts in controlling the growth of expensive time deposits  the percentage of the average time deposits over the average total deposits slightly increased to in from in and in  because of the stiff competition for deposits in the markets where we do business 
however  the increase from to is due to growth in time deposits less than  which are considered as core deposits 
jumbo time deposits  or time deposits with balances of  or greater as a percentage of total average deposits  decreased during the same period 
we will continue to promote our core deposit campaign in order to achieve the assigned core deposit goals and to reduce our level of time deposit reliance going forward

a number of clients carry deposit balances that were more than of our total deposits  but at both december   and  the california state treasury was the only depositor whose deposit balance was more than of our total deposits 
in addition to our regular customer base  we also accept brokered deposits on a selective basis at reasonable interest rates to augment deposit growth 
during  the ongoing financial crisis and stiff competition for customer deposits among banks within the markets where we do business has driven up interest rates on various deposit products 
as a result  broker deposits have been lower in cost  as compared with other time deposits 
accordingly  as our liquidity has improved in through the inflow of core deposits  we were able to decrease these deposits to million at december  from million and million  at december  and  respectively  in order to improve our net interest margin and to limit our reliance on high interest rate time deposits 
most of the brokered deposits will mature within one year 
fhlb borrowings although deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for general business purposes  we may obtain advances from the fhlb as an alternative to retail

we have historically utilized borrowings from fhlb in order to take advantage of the flexibility and comparatively low cost 
due to the ongoing financial crisis and stiff competition for customer deposits among banks in our market  we have occasionally used fhlb borrowings as an alternative to fund our growing loan portfolio

on march   the federal reserve board adopted a final rule that allows continued inclusion of trust preferred securities in the tier capital of bank holding companies  subject to stricter quantitative limits 
under the final rule  bank holding companies may include trust preferred securities in tier capital in an amount together with other restricted core capital elements equal to of the sum of core capital elements including restricted core capital elements net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
amounts in excess of these limits will generally be included in tier capital 
for purposes of this rule  restricted core capital elements are generally to be comprised of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  minority interest related to qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock directly issued by a consolidated us depository institution or foreign bank subsidiary  minority interest related to qualifying common stock or qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock directly issued by a consolidated subsidiary that is neither a us depository institution or a foreign bank and qualifying trust preferred securities 
the final rule provides a transition period for bank holding companies to come into compliance with the new required capital restrictions 
accordingly  while the final rule became effective on april   for practical purposes  bank holding companies will have until march  an extension of the previous effective date of march  as a result of continued economic pressures to come into compliance with the final rule s capital restrictions due to the transition period 
therefore all bank holding companies may include cumulative  perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities in tier capital up to the of total core capital 
in extending the transition period to  the federal reserve noted that the extended period will provide bank holding companies with existing trust preferred securities with call features after the first five years an opportunity to restructure their capital elements in order to conform to the limitations of the final rule 
under the final rule  as of december   wilshire bancorp categorized all million trust preferred securities as tier capital 

table of contents asset liability management management seeks to ascertain optimum and stable utilization of available assets and liabilities as a vehicle to attain our overall business plans and objectives 
in this regard  management focuses on measurement and control of liquidity risk  interest rate risk and market risk  capital adequacy  operation risk and credit risk 
see risk factors for further discussion on these risks 
information concerning interest rate risk management is set forth under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
liquidity management liquidity management involves our ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily operations  which include funding of securities purchases  providing for customers credit needs and ongoing repayment of borrowings 
maintenance of adequate liquidity requires that sufficient resources be available at all time to meet our cash flow requirements 
liquidity in a banking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of its customers and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise 
liquidity management involves our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss  and to raise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost 
our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by the asset liability committee and the board of directors 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet the needs of the company  including adequate cash flow for off balance sheet instruments 
our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and brokered deposits  federal funds facilities  repurchase agreement facilities  advances from the fhlb of san francisco  and issuance of long term debt 
these funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans  the routine liquidation of securities from the available for sale portfolio and securitizations of loans 
in addition  government programs  such as fdic s tlgp  may influence deposit behavior 
primary use of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits  originations and purchases of loans  purchases of investment securities  and payment of operating expenses 
during the years ended december    and  we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities of million  million  and million  respectively 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the million net income adjusted for various non cash flow adjustments  including the subtraction of million origination of loan held for sale  and additions of million proceeds from sale of loans held for sale and million provision for losses on loans and loan commitments 
similarly in and  the net cash provided by operating activities were primarily attributable to the net income earned during the immediately preceding years 
net cash outflows from investing activities totaled million  million  and million  during  and  respectively 
during and net cash out flows were primarily related to the net increases in loans receivable for those years 
however  in  investment security purchases was the largest single contributing factor at million 
largest cash in flows were also attributed to securities  cash from matured and sold securities totaled million in net cash inflows from financing activities were million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to the increase in deposits  which totaled million 
in addition to the deposit increase  the pay down of million in fhlb advances was the next largest financing activity 
the net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to the proceeds from fhlb borrowings and other borrowings of million  and issuance of series a preferred stock to the us treasury in an amount equal to million 
in addition to the debt and equity financing  there 
table of contents was a million net increase in deposits 
in  net cash provided by financing activities were primarily related to million fhlb borrowings and other borrowings  and million proceed from issuance of trust preferred securities 
for purpose of having liquid cash available for emergencies  we maintain a portion of our funds in cash and cash equivalents  deposits in other financial institutions and loans and securities available for sale 
our liquid assets at december    and totaled approximately million  million  million  respectively 
our liquidity level measured as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets was   and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in liquid assets in is a result both large inflows of deposits during the year  in particular core deposits and assets from the acquisition of mirae bank in the second quarter 
as a secondary source of liquidity  we have available a combination of borrowing sources comprised of the federal reserve bank s discount window  fhlb advances  federal funds lines with various corresponding banks  and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies 
among all these sources  we prefer advances from the fhlb to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements 
advances from the fhlb are typically secured by our mortgage loans and stock issued by the fhlb 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution s net worth or on the fhlb s assessment of the institution s creditworthiness 
while this fund provides flexibility and reasonable cost  we limit our use to of our borrowing capacity  as such borrowing does not qualify as core funds 
as of december   our borrowing capacity from the fhlb was about million and the outstanding balance was million  or approximately of our borrowing capacity 
as of december   we also maintained a guideline to purchase up to a combined million in federal funds through lines with four correspondent banks 
borrowing capacity at the frb discount window stood at million  with million in securities pledged at december  it is management s belief that our liquidity is sufficient to meet the company s short term and long term cash flow needs as they arise 
capital resources and capital adequacy requirements historically  our primary source of capital has been internally generated operating income through retained earnings 
in order to ensure adequate levels of capital  we conduct ongoing assessments of projected sources and uses of capital in conjunction with projected increases in assets and level of risks 
we have considered  and we will continue to consider  additional sources of capital as the need arises  whether through the issuance of additional equity  debt or hybrid securities 
when the us treasury made tarp funds available to financial institutions in october  our board of directors decided to take advantage of this opportunity and increased our capital by participating in the program 
in december  we received a tarp investment from the us treasury in the amount of million 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that rely on quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions under the prompt corrective action rules that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
prompt corrective action may include regulatory enforcement actions that restrict dividend payments  require the adoption of remedial measures to increase capital  terminate fdic deposit insurance  and mandate the appointment of a conservator or receiver in severe cases 
in addition  failure to maintain a 
table of contents well capitalized status may adversely affect the evaluation of regulatory applications for specific transactions and activities  including acquisitions  continuation and expansion of existing activities  and commencement of new activities  and could adversely affect our business relationships with our existing and prospective clients 
the aforementioned regulatory consequences for failing to maintain adequate ratios of tier and tier capital could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
see part i  item description of business regulation and supervision capital adequacy requirements in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements 
as of december   we were qualified as a well capitalized institution under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action

in  total shareholders equity also grew by million from million at december   after declaring cash dividends of million  primarily from internally generated operating income of million 
as of both december  and  we considered the junior subordinated debentures of million  which consists of million issued by the bank and million issued by the company in connection with the issuance of million trust preferred securities for the regulatory capital ratio computation purposes 
at december   wilshire bancorp accounted for million of such securities as tier capital and million as tier capital 
at december   as the result of issuance of the series a preferred stock in december  the portion qualified for tier capital increased to million million tarp preferred stock and million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
we evaluate market risk pursuant to policies reviewed and approved annually by our board of directors 
the board delegates responsibility for market risk management to the asset liability management alm committee  which reports monthly to the board on activities related to market risk management 
as part of the management of our market risk  our alm committee may direct changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
to that end  we actively monitor and manage interest rate risk exposures 
interest rate risk management involves development  analysis  implementation and monitoring of earnings to provide stable earnings and capital levels during periods of changing interest rates 
in the management of interest rate risk  we utilize monthly gap analysis and quarterly simulation modeling to determine the sensitivity of net interest income and economic value of equity 
these techniques are complementary and are used together to provide a more accurate measurement of interest rate risk 
gap analysis measures the repricing mismatches between assets and liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is determined by subtracting the amount of liabilities from the amount of assets that reprice in a particular time interval 
if repricing assets exceed repricing liabilities in any given time period  we would be deemed to be asset sensitive for that period 
conversely  if repricing liabilities exceed repricing assets  we would be deemed to be liability sensitive for that period 
we usually seek to maintain a balanced position over the period of one year to ensure net interest margin stability in times of volatile interest rates 
this is accomplished by maintaining a similar level of interest earning assets and interest paying liabilities available to be repriced within one year 
the change in net interest income may not always follow the general expectations of an asset sensitive or a liability sensitive balance sheet during periods of changing interest rates 
this possibility results from interest rates changing by differing increments and at different time intervals for each type of interest sensitive asset and liability 
the interest rate sensitivity gaps reported in the tables arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals 
because these gaps are actively managed and change daily as adjustments are made in interest rate views and market outlook  positions at the end of any period may not reflect our interest rate sensitivity in subsequent periods 
we attempt to balance longer term economic views against prospects for short term interest rate changes 
although the interest rate sensitivity gap is a useful measurement and contributes to effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on that measure 
as a result  the alm committee also regularly uses simulation modeling as a tool to measure the sensitivity of earnings and net portfolio value npv to interest rate changes 
the npv is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the simulation model captures all assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments and accounts for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates 
these include prepayment speeds on loans  cash flows of loans and deposits  principal amortization  call options on securities  balance sheet growth assumptions and changes in rate relationships as various rate indices react differently to market rates 
although the simulation measures the volatility of net interest income and net portfolio value under immediate increase or decrease of market interest rate scenarios in basis point increments  our main concern is the negative effect of a reasonably possible worst scenario 
the alm policy prescribes that for the worst possible rate decreasing scenario the possible reduction of net interest income and npv should not exceed of the base net interest income and of the base npv  respectively 

table of contents in general  based upon our current mix of deposits  loans and investments  decrease in interest rates would result the increase of net interest margin and npv 
increase in interest rates would be expected to have opposite effect 
however  given in the record low interest rate environment  further decrease in interest rate will result in net interest margin as shown in our simulation measures below 
management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate the vulnerability of our operations to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and npv could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which they are based 
the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  using the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
for purposes of the following table  an asset or liability is considered rate sensitive within a specified period when it can be repriced or matures within its contractual terms 
actual payment patterns may differ from contractual payment patterns
