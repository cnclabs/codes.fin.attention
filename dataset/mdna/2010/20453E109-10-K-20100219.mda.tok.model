item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this annual report 
in may  our board of directors authorized and committed to a plan to sell certain operations in the barnett shale region of north texas  consisting primarily of our supply store business  as well as certain non strategic drilling logistics assets and other completion and production services assets 
on may   we sold these operations to a company owned by a former officer of one of our subsidiaries 
in august  our board of directors authorized and committed to a plan to sell certain manufacturing and production enhancement product sales operations of a subsidiary located in alberta  canada  which includes certain assets located in south texas 
this sale was completed on october  we revised our financial statements and reclassified the assets and liabilities of these disposal groups as held for sale as of the date of each balance sheet presented and removed the results of operations of the disposal group from net income from continuing operations  and presented these separately as income from discontinued operations  net of tax  for each of the accompanying statements of operations 
we ceased depreciating the assets when each disposal group was reclassified as held for sale  and we adjusted the net assets to the lower of carrying value or fair value less selling costs

adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure of performance 
we use adjusted ebitda as the primary internal management measure for evaluating performance and allocating additional resources 
the calculation of adjusted ebitda is different from the calculation of ebitda  as defined and used in our credit facilities 
for a discussion of the calculation of ebitda as defined under our existing credit facilities  as recently amended  see note  long term debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
adjusted ebitda is included in this annual report on form k because our management considers it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry  some of which present ebitda when reporting their results 
we regularly evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and or tax rates by using adjusted ebitda 
in addition  we use adjusted ebitda in evaluating acquisition targets 
management also believes that adjusted ebitda is a useful tool for measuring our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditures and working capital requirements  and adjusted ebitda is commonly used by us and our investors to measure our ability to service indebtedness 
adjusted ebitda is not a substitute for the gaap measures of earnings or cash flow and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs 
in addition  it should be noted that companies calculate ebitda differently and  therefore  ebitda has material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization and minority interest

overview we are a leading provider of specialized services and products focused on helping oil and gas companies develop hydrocarbon reserves  reduce operating costs and enhance production 
we focus on basins within north america that we believe have attractive long term potential for growth  and we deliver targeted  value added services and products required by our customers within each specific basin 
we believe our range of services and products positions us to meet the many needs of our customers at the wellsite  from drilling and completion through production and eventual abandonment 
we manage our operations from regional field service facilities located throughout the us rocky mountain region  texas  oklahoma  louisiana  arkansas  pennsylvania  western canada  mexico and southeast asia 
we operate in three business segments completion and production services 
through our completion and production services segment  we establish  maintain and enhance the flow of oil and gas throughout the life of a well 
this segment is divided into the following primary service lines intervention services 
well intervention requires the use of specialized equipment to perform an array of wellbore services 
our fleet of intervention service equipment includes coiled tubing units  pressure pumping units  nitrogen units  well service rigs  snubbing units and a variety of support equipment 
our intervention services provide customers with innovative solutions to increase production of oil and gas 
downhole and wellsite services 
our downhole and wellsite services include electric line  slickline  production optimization  production testing  rental and fishing services 
fluid handling 
we provide a variety of services to help our customers obtain  move  store and dispose of fluids that are involved in the development and production of their reservoirs 
through our fleet of specialized trucks  frac tanks and other assets  we provide fluid transportation  heating  pumping and disposal services for our customers 
drilling services 
through our drilling services segment  we provide services and equipment that initiate or stimulate oil and gas production by providing land drilling and specialized rig logistics services 
our drilling rigs operate primarily in and around the barnett shale region of north texas 
product sales 
we provide oilfield service equipment and refurbishment of used equipment through our southeast asian business  and we provide repair work and fabrication services for our customers at a business located in gainesville  texas 

table of contents substantially all service and rental revenue we earn is based upon a charge for a period of time an hour  a day  a week for the actual period of time the service or rental is provided to our customer or on a fixed per stage completed fee 
product sales are recorded when the actual sale occurs and title or ownership passes to the customer 
our customers include large multi national and independent oil and gas producers  as well as smaller independent producers and the major land based drilling contractors in north america see customers in item of this annual report on form k 
the primary factors influencing demand for our services and products is the level of drilling and workover activity of our customers and the complexity of such activity  which in turn  depends on current and anticipated future oil and gas prices  production depletion rates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by our customers to their drilling and workover budgets 
as a result  demand for our services and products is cyclical  substantially depends on activity levels in the north american oil and gas industry and is highly sensitive to current and expected oil and natural gas prices

we consider the drilling and well service rig counts to be an indication of spending by our customers in the oil and gas industry for exploration and development of new and existing hydrocarbon reserves 
these spending levels are a primary driver of our business  and we believe that our customers tend to invest more in these activities when oil and gas prices are at higher levels or are increasing 
the utilization of our assets and the performance of our business can be impacted by these and other external and internal factors 
see item a 
risk factors 
we generally charge for our services either on a dayrate or per stage completed basis 
depending on the specific service  charges may include one or more of these components a set up charge  an hourly service rate based on equipment and labor  a stage completed charge  an equipment rental charge  a consumables charge  and a mileage and fuel charge 
we generally determine the rates charged through a competitive process on a job by job basis 
typically  work is performed on a call out basis  whereby the customer requests services on a job specific basis  but does not guarantee work levels beyond the specific job bid 
for contract drilling services  fees are charged based on standard dayrates or  to a lesser extent  as negotiated by footage contracts 
product sales generated through our southeast asian business are typically based on a pre determined price book 
outlook since our initial public offering  in april  our growth strategy has been focused on internal growth in the basins in which we currently operate  as we sought to maximize our equipment utilization  add additional like kind equipment and expand service and product offerings 
in addition  we have sought new basins in which to replicate this approach and augmented our internal growth with strategic acquisitions 
in late  we noticed a decline in drilling and exploration expenditures by our customers following the significant decline in oil and gas commodity prices 
accordingly  in we decreased our level of investment relative to recent years  and implemented cost saving measures throughout  while remaining responsive to our customers needs for quality services 
internal capital investment 
our internal expansion activities have generally consisted of adding equipment and qualified personnel in locations where we have established a presence 
we have grown our operations in many of these locations by expanding services to current customers  attracting new customers and hiring local personnel with local basin level expertise and leadership recognition 
depending on customer demand  we will consider adding equipment to further increase the capacity of services currently 
table of contents being provided and or add equipment to expand the services we provide 
we invested million in equipment additions over the three year period ended december   which included million for the completion and production services segment  million for the drilling services segment  million for the product sales segment and million related to general corporate operations 
for the year ended december   we invested only million in capital expenditures 
external growth 
we use strategic acquisitions as an integral part of our growth strategy 
we consider acquisitions that will add to our service offerings in a current operating area or that will expand our geographical footprint into a targeted basin 
we have completed several acquisitions in recent years 
these acquisitions affect our operating performance period to period 
accordingly  comparisons of revenue and operating results are not necessarily comparable and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we invested an aggregate of million in acquisitions over the three year period ended december  of this amount  we invested an aggregate of million to acquire businesses during and million to acquire businesses during we did not complete any business acquisitions during the year ended december  primarily due to poor market conditions 
see significant acquisitions 
natural gas prices have declined from historical highs in and rotary rig counts have also declined significantly 
the recent change in activity levels are likely the result of a number of macro economic factors  such as an excess supply of natural gas  lower demand for oil and gas  market expectations of weather conditions and the utilization of heating fuels  the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry and other general market conditions for the us economy  including the current global economic recession and the recent financial crisis  which contributed to significant reductions in available capital and liquidity from banks and other providers of credit 
we experienced a significant decline in utilization of our assets starting in late which continued throughout most of although activity began to recover at the end of  we anticipate that lower commodity prices and activity levels relative to  will continue to adversely impact our near term results 
due to challenging market conditions  we recorded non cash impairment charges of million and million at december  and  respectively  related to the write down of goodwill for various of our reporting units 
in  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million for our canadian reporting unit 
in addition  we recorded a million impairment charge related to our drilling assets and a million charge related to other intangible assets during the year ended december  although we cannot determine the depth or duration of the decline in activity in the oil and gas industry  we believe the overall long term outlook for north american oilfield activity and our business remains favorable  especially in the basins in which we operate 
our business continues to be impacted by seasonality and inclement weather  including the effects of the normal second quarter canadian break up  as well as the impact of gulf of mexico tropical weather systems 
we  and many of our competitors  have invested in new equipment  some of which requires long lead times to manufacture 
as more of this equipment is available to be placed into service and if oilfield activity declines  there will be additional excess capacity in the industry  which may further negatively impact our utilization rates and pricing for certain service offerings 
in addition  as new equipment enters the market  we must compete for employees to crew the equipment  which puts inflationary pressure on labor costs 
our equipment fleet is relatively new  as we have made significant investments in new equipment over the past few years 
we continue to monitor our equipment utilization and poll our customers to assess demand levels 
as equipment enters the marketplace or competition for existing customers increases  we believe our customers will rely upon service providers with local knowledge and a proven ability to effectively execute complex services on location  which we believe we have and which constitutes fundamental aspects of our growth strategy 
significant transactions during  we acquired substantially all the assets or all of the equity interests in four oilfield service companies  for million in cash  resulting in goodwill of approximately million 
several of these acquisitions were subject to final working capital adjustments 
on february   we acquired substantially all of the assets of kr fishing rental  inc for million in cash  resulting in goodwill of million 
kr fishing rental  inc is a provider of fishing  
table of contents rental and foam unit services in the piceance basin and the raton basin  and is located in rangely  colorado 
we believe this acquisition complements our completion and production services business in the rocky mountain region 
on april   we acquired all the outstanding common stock of frac source services  inc  a provider of pressure pumping services to customers in the barnett shale of north texas  for million in cash  net of cash acquired  which includes a working capital adjustment of million and recorded goodwill of million 
upon closing this transaction  we entered into a contract with one of our major customers to provide pressure pumping services in the barnett shale utilizing three frac fleets under a contract with a term that extends up to three years from the date each fleet is placed into service 
we spent an additional million in on capital equipment related to these contracted frac fleets 
thus  our total investment in this operation was approximately million 
we believe this acquisition expands our pressure pumping business in north texas and that the related contract provides a stable revenue stream from which to expand our pressure pumping business outside of this region 
on october   we acquired all of the membership interests of tsws well services  llc  a limited liability corporation which held substantially all of the well servicing and heavy haul assets of tsws  inc  a company based in magnolia  arkansas  which provides well servicing and heavy haul services to customers in northern louisiana  east texas and southern arkansas 
as consideration  we paid million in cash and prepaid an additional million related to an employee retention bonus pool 
we also recorded goodwill totaling million 
we believe this acquisition extends our geographic reach into the haynesville shale area 
on october   we acquired substantially all of the assets of appalachian wells services  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  each of which is based in shelocta  pennsylvania 
this business provides pressure pumping  e line and coiled tubing services in the appalachian region  and includes a service area which extends through portions of pennsylvania  west virginia  ohio and new york 
as consideration for the purchase  we paid million in cash and issued  unregistered shares of our common stock  valued at per share 
we invested an additional million to complete a frac fleet at this location and have an option to purchase real property for approximately million 
in addition  we have entered into an agreement under which we may be required to pay up to an additional million in cash consideration during the earn out period which extends through  based upon the results of operations of various service lines acquired 
we recorded goodwill of approximately million associated with this acquisition  however  this goodwill was deemed impaired in and expensed as of december  this acquisition created a platform for future growth for our pressure pumping and other completion and production service lines in the marcellus shale 
in addition  we completed several other smaller acquisitions in which have contributed to the expansion of our business into new geographic regions or enhanced our service and product offerings 
we have accounted for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting  whereby the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of net assets acquired  including intangibles and property  plant and equipment at depreciated replacement costs with the excess to goodwill 
results of operations related to each of the acquired companies have been included in our combined operations as of the date of acquisition 
in may  our board of directors authorized and committed to a plan to sell certain operations in the barnett shale region of north texas  consisting primarily of our supply store business  as well as certain non strategic drilling logistics assets and other completion and production services assets 
on may   we sold these operations to select energy services  llc  a company owned by a former officer of one of our subsidiaries  for which we received proceeds of million in cash and assets with a fair market value of million 
the carrying value of the net assets sold was approximately million  excluding million of allocated goodwill associated with the combination that formed complete production services  inc in september we recorded a loss on the sale of this disposal group totaling approximately million  which included million related to income taxes 
in accordance with the sales agreement  we sublet office space to select energy services  llc and provided certain administrative services for an initial term of one year  at an agreed upon rate 

table of contents in march  our canadian subsidiary exchanged certain non monetary assets with a net book value of million related to our production testing business for certain e line assets of a competitor 
we recorded a non cash loss on the transaction of million  which represented the difference between the carrying value and the fair market value of the assets surrendered 
we believe the e line assets will generate incremental future cash flows compared to the production testing assets exchanged 
market environment we operate in a highly competitive industry 
our competition includes many large and small oilfield service companies 
as such  we price our services and products to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate  adjusting our rates to reflect current market conditions as necessary 
we examine the rate of utilization of our equipment as one measure of our ability to compete in the current market environment 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available through open market quotes 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically  and actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we must use our judgment related to uncertainties in order to make these estimates and assumptions 
in the selection of our critical accounting policies  the objective is to properly reflect our financial position and results of operations for each reporting period in a consistent manner that can be understood by the reader of our financial statements 
our accounting policies and procedures are explained in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we consider an estimate to be critical if it is subjective and if changes in the estimate using different assumptions would result in a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies and estimates  and have provided a description  information about variability and our historical experience  including a sensitivity analysis  if applicable 
revenue recognition we recognize service revenue as services are performed and when realized or earned 
revenue is deemed to be realized or earned when we determine that the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these services are generally provided over a relatively short period of time pursuant to short term contracts at pre determined dayrate fees  or on a day to day basis 
revenue and costs related to drilling contracts are recognized as work progresses 
progress is measured as revenue is recognized based upon dayrate charges 
for certain contracts  we may receive lump sum payments from our customers related to the mobilization of rigs and other drilling equipment 
under these arrangements  we defer revenues and the related cost of services and recognize them over the term of the drilling contract 
costs incurred to relocate rigs and other drilling equipment to areas in which a contract has not been secured are expensed as incurred 
revenues associated with product sales are recorded when product title is transferred to the customer 
under current gaap  revenue is to be recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
the sec s rules and regulations provide additional guidance for revenue recognition under specific circumstances  including bill and hold transactions 
there is a risk that our results of operations could be misstated if we do not record revenue in the proper accounting period 

table of contents the nature of our business has been such that we generally bill for services over a relatively short period of time and record revenues as products are sold 
we did not record material adjustments resulting from revenue recognition issues for the years ended december   and impairment of long lived assets based on guidance from the financial accounting standards board fasb regarding accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate potential impairment of long lived assets and intangibles  excluding goodwill and other intangible assets without defined service lives  when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  we project the fair value of the assets by estimating the undiscounted future cash in flows to be derived from the long lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives  as well as any salvage value 
then  we compare this fair value estimate to the carrying value of the assets and determine whether the assets are deemed to be impaired 
for goodwill and other intangible assets without defined service lives  we perform an annual impairment test  whereby we estimate the fair value of the asset by discounting future cash flows at a projected cost of capital rate 
if the fair value estimate is less than the carrying value of the asset  an additional test is required whereby we apply a purchase price analysis similar to a purchase price allocation for a business combination 
if impairment is still indicated  we would record an impairment loss in the current reporting period for the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its projected fair value 
our industry is highly cyclical and the estimate of future cash flows requires the use of assumptions and our judgment 
periods of prolonged down cycles in the industry could have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and may result in impairment charges 
if our estimates do not approximate actual performance or if the rates we used to discount cash flows vary significantly from actual discount rates  we could overstate our assets and an impairment loss may not be timely identified 
we tested goodwill for impairment for each of the years ended december   and management prepared a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair market value of the reportable units as of the annual testing date 
projected cash flows were based on certain management assumptions related to expected growth  capital investment and terminal value  discounted at a market participant weighted average cost of capital  refined to reflect our current and anticipated capital structure 
based on this analysis  management determined that goodwill was impaired in  and in accordance with the fasb s guidance for goodwill  management performed a step two analysis to calculate the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting units exceeded the projected fair market value of such units as of the annual testing date 
as a result of this testing in  management recorded an impairment charge which reduced goodwill in canada by million 
this annual testing was performed in and yielded another impairment for this canadian subsidiary as of the test date 
however  due to a decline in the overall us debt and equity markets and concerns over the availability of credit  we determined that a triggering event had occurred during the fourth quarter of therefore  we performed our impairment calculations again as of december   incorporating our most recent assumptions of future earnings and cash flows 
based on this testing  we determined that the goodwill associated with most of our reporting units had been impaired 
we recorded an impairment charge of million at december  in calculating this impairment charge  management made assumptions about future earnings by reportable unit  which may differ from actual future earnings for these operations 
in  management performed additional analysis and determined that further write downs were necessary 
we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million associated with several of our reportable units at december  in addition  pursuant to an undiscounted cash flow analysis  we recorded a fixed asset impairment in our drilling services segment of million and an intangible asset impairment in our completion and production services segment totaling million 
see property  plant and equipment 
a significant decline in expected future cash flow  a further erosion of market conditions or a lower than expected recovery of the oil and gas industry activity levels in future years  could result in an additional impairment charge 
stock options and other stock based compensation we have issued stock based compensation to certain employees  officers and directors in the form of stock options and restricted stock 
in accordance with us gaap  we account for grants made prior to september   the date of our initial filing with the sec  using the minimum value method  whereby no compensation 
table of contents expense is recognized for stock based compensation grants that have an exercise price equal to the fair value of the stock on the date of grant 
for grants of stock based compensation between october  and december   we utilized the modified prospective transition method to record expense associated with these options  whereby we did not record compensation expense associated with these grants during the period october  through december  but provided pro forma disclosure of this expense  and  then began recognizing compensation expense related to these grants over the remaining vesting period after december  based upon a calculated fair value 
these grants were fully vested as of december  for grants of stock based compensation on or after january   we recognize expense associated with new awards of stock based compensation  as determined using a black scholes pricing model over the expected term of the award 
in addition  we record compensation expense associated with restricted stock which has been granted to certain of our directors  officers and employees 
in accordance with current us gaap  we calculate compensation expense on the date of grant number of options granted multiplied by the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and recognize this expense  adjusted for forfeitures  ratably over the applicable vesting period 
us gaap permits the use of various models to determine the fair value of stock options and the variables used for the model are highly subjective 
for purposes of determining compensation expense associated with stock options granted after january   we are required to determine the fair value of the stock options by applying a pricing model which includes assumptions for expected term  discount rate  stock volatility  expected forfeitures and a dividend rate 
the use of different assumptions or a different model may have a material impact on our financial disclosures 
for the years ended december   and  we applied a black scholes model with similar assumptions for expected term based on a probability analysis and ranging from to years  risk free rate based upon published rates for us treasury notes  zero dividend rate and stock volatility  which we determined based on our historical common stock volatility for grants after june and estimated based on the historical volatility rates of several peer companies prior to that time 
in addition  we estimated a forfeiture rate based upon our historical experience 
we have recorded compensation expense associated with stock option and restricted stock grants totaling million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
allowance for bad debts and inventory obsolescence we record trade accounts receivable at billed amounts  less an allowance for bad debts 
inventory is recorded at cost  less an allowance for obsolescence 
to estimate these allowances  management reviews the underlying details of these assets as well as known trends in the marketplace  and applies historical factors as a basis for recording these allowances 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if our historical experience is materially different from future experience  additional allowances may be required 
there is a risk that management may not detect uncollectible accounts or unsalvageable inventory in the correct accounting period 
bad debt expense has been less than of sales for the years ended december   and if bad debt expense had increased by of sales for the years ended december   and  net income would have declined by million  million and million  respectively 
our obsolescence and other inventory reserves were approximately  and of our inventory balances at december   and  respectively 
a increase in inventory reserves  from to  at december  would have decreased net income by million for the year then ended 
property  plant and equipment we record property  plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation 
major betterments to existing assets are capitalized  while repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the service lives of our equipment are expensed 
we determine the useful lives of our depreciable assets based upon historical experience and the judgment of our operating personnel 
we generally depreciate the historical cost of assets  less an estimate of the applicable salvage value  on the straight line basis over the applicable useful lives 
upon disposition or retirement of 
table of contents an asset  we record a gain or loss if the proceeds from the transaction differ from the net book value of the asset at the time of the disposition or retirement 
gaap permits various depreciation methods to recognize the use of assets 
use of a different depreciation method or different depreciable lives could result in materially different results 
if our depreciation estimates are not correct  we could over or understate our results of operations  such as recording a disproportionate amount of gains or losses upon disposition of assets 
there is also a risk that the useful lives we apply for our depreciation calculation will not approximate the actual useful life of the asset 
we believe our estimates of useful lives are materially correct and that these estimates are consistent with industry averages 
we evaluate property  plant and equipment for impairment when there are indicators of impairment 
during september  we evaluated the fair market value of assets in our contract drilling business with the assistance of a third party appraiser and determined that the carrying value of certain of these drilling rigs exceeded the fair market value estimates 
we projected the undiscounted cash flows associated with these rigs  including an estimate of salvage value  and compared these expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the rigs 
if the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount  no further testing was performed and the rig was deemed to not be impaired 
if the undiscounted cash flows did not exceed the carrying value  we estimated the fair market value of the equipment based on management estimates and general market data obtained by the third party appraiser using the sales comparison market approach  which included the analysis of recent sales and offering prices of similar equipment to arrive at an indication of the most probable selling price for the equipment 
the result of this analysis was a calculated fixed asset impairment of million  which was recorded as an impairment loss in september  this impairment charge was allocated entirely to the drilling services business segment 
this impairment was deemed necessary due to an overall decline in oil and gas exploration and production activity in late which extended throughout  as well as management s expectation of future operating results for this business segment 
there were no significant impairment charges related to our long term assets during the years ended december  and depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended december  and represented and of the average depreciable asset base for the respective years 
an increase in depreciation relative to the depreciable base of  from to  would have reduced net income by approximately million for the year ended december  self insurance on january   we began a self insurance program to pay claims associated with health care benefits provided to certain of our employees in the united states 
pursuant to this program  we have purchased a stop loss insurance policy from an insurance company 
our accounting policy for this self insurance program is to accrue expense based upon the number of employees enrolled in the plan at pre determined rates 
as claims are processed and paid  we compare our claims history to our expected claims in order to estimate incurred but not reported claims 
if our estimate of claims incurred but not reported exceeds our current accrual  we record additional expense during the current period 
there is a risk that we may not estimate our incurred but not reported claims correctly or that our stop loss provision may not be adequate to insure us against losses in the future 
at december   we accrued million pursuant to this self insurance program 
a increase in this self insurance accrual would reduce our net income for the year ended december  by million 
deferred income taxes our income tax expense includes income taxes related to the united states  canada and other foreign countries  including local  state and provincial income taxes 
we account for tax ramifications pursuant to us gaap for income taxes and record deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and measure tax expense using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period of the change 
furthermore  we record a valuation allowance for any net deferred income tax assets which we believe are likely to not be used through future operations 
as of december   and  we recorded a valuation allowance of less than million related to certain deferred tax assets in canada 
if our estimates and assumptions related to our deferred tax position change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and our effective tax rate may 
table of contents increase  which could adversely affect our financial results 
as of december   we did not provide deferred us income taxes on approximately million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in which we intend to indefinitely reinvest 
upon distribution of these earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we may be subject to us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
on january   we adopted the fasb interpretation that provides guidance to account for uncertain tax positions 
during  we performed an evaluation of our tax positions and determined that this interpretation did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we have evaluated our tax positions at december  and believe these positions are deemed appropriate for all significant matters 
there is a risk that estimates related to the use of loss carry forwards and the realizability of deferred tax accounts may be incorrect  and that the result could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
in addition  future changes in tax laws or gaap requirements could result in additional valuation allowances or the recognition of additional tax liabilities 
historically  we have utilized net operating loss carry forwards to partially offset current tax expense  and we have recorded a valuation allowance to the extent we expect that our deferred tax assets will not be utilized through future operations 
deferred income tax assets totaled million at december   against which we recorded a valuation allowance of million  leaving a net deferred tax asset of million deemed realizable 
changes in our valuation allowance would affect our net income on a dollar for dollar basis 
discontinued operations we account for discontinued operations in accordance with the fasb guidance on accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
us gaap requires that we classify the assets and liabilities of a disposal group as held for sale if the following criteria are met management  with appropriate authority  commits to a plan to sell a disposal group  the asset is available for immediate sale in its current condition  an active program to locate a buyer and other actions to complete the sale have been initiated  the sale is probable  the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a reasonable price  and actions required to complete the plan of sale indicate it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan of sale will occur or that the plan will be withdrawn 
once deemed held for sale  we no longer depreciate the assets of the disposal group 
upon sale  we calculate the gain or loss associated with the disposition by comparing the carrying value of the assets less direct costs of the sale with the proceeds received 
in conjunction with the sale  we settle inter company balances between us and the disposal group and allocate interest expense to the disposal group for the period the assets were held for sale 
in the statement of operations  we present discontinued operations  net of tax effect  as a separate caption below net income from continuing operations 
prior period adjustments in june  we discovered accounting errors within one of our operations located in the rocky mountain region  which occurred in prior years and impacted our reported operating results for the years ended december   and the majority of the errors were due to a flawed revenue accrual process and ineffective controls over inventory within this operation 
we evaluated the impact that these errors had on our financial statements and determined that these errors would not have been material to our financial statements from a quantitative or qualitative perspective for those periods 
however  the amount of the adjustment required to correct these errors was deemed to be material to the results for we corrected these errors as of june  and made the required adjustments to our reported results for the comparative periods in the applicable subsequent public filings

table of contents below is a detailed discussion of our operating results by segment for these periods 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue revenue from continuing operations for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to  million from  million for the year ended december  this decrease by segment was as follows completion and production services 
segment revenue decreased million  or  primarily due to an overall decline in investment by our customers in oil and gas exploration and development activities resulting from lower oil and gas commodity prices and concerns over the availability of capital for such investment 
we experienced lower utilization and pricing for each of our service offerings on a year over year basis  except for our coiled tubing business in mexico which provided a positive contribution to results 
in the fourth quarter of  we experienced an increase in revenues and margins compared to the third quarter of as market conditions showed signs of improvement 
drilling services 
segment revenue decreased million  or  for the year  primarily due to the overall decline in oilfield service activities throughout the year compared to lower utilization rates and pricing pressure impacted our rig logistics and drilling businesses  however revenues were up slightly in the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of as we experienced a slight increase in customer activity 
product sales 
segment revenue decreased million  or  for the year  primarily due to a decline in our southeast asian business resulting from a change in the sales mix and the timing of product sales and equipment refurbishment  which tends to be project specific 
partially offsetting this decrease were the consistent revenues earned at our fabrication business in north texas year over year  which included a work over rig project completed in the first quarter of and sales of low margin equipment to third parties 
service and product expenses service and product expenses include labor costs associated with the execution and support of our services  materials used in the performance of those services and other costs directly related to the support and maintenance of equipment 
these expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from  million for the year ended december  the decline in service and product expenses was primarily due to significantly lower activity levels and cost saving measures we began implementing in late  including headcount reductions  payroll concessions and reduced product and service costs from outside vendors

completion and production services 
service and product expenses as a percentage of revenue for this business segment increased when comparing the year ended december  to the same period in 
table of contents the overall decline in activity levels in the oil and gas industry  which began in late and continued throughout most of the year in  resulted in lower utilization of our equipment and services  and pricing pressure from competitors 
partially defraying the impact of this overall decline in activity levels were cost saving measures we began implementing in late drilling services 
the increase in service and product expenses as a percentage of revenue for this business segment was primarily due to lower utilization of our equipment due to significantly reduced activity levels by our customers  and lower pricing on a year over year basis  partially offset by cost saving measures 
product sales 
the increase in service and product expenses as a percentage of revenue for the products segments was primarily due to the mix of products sold for the relative periods  as the results included several higher margin projects associated with our southeast asian operations when compared to the year ended december  additionally  on a year over year basis  a larger proportion of the revenues and related costs for the product sales segment for the year ended december  were provided by our repair and fabrication facility in north texas at lower margins relative to our southeast asian business  including the sale of a large inventory item 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries and other related expenses for our selling  administrative  finance  information technology and human resource functions 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  for the year ended december  to million from million during the year ended december  several cost saving measures were implemented during including headcount reductions  other payroll concessions and lower outside service costs 
these expense reductions were offset by the loss on the exchange of certain non monetary assets in canada during the first quarter of which totaled million  higher bad debt expense  particularly in our drilling services segment and higher losses from the disposal of fixed assets 
excluding the impact of the non monetary asset exchange in canada  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expense was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was the result of the following depreciation of equipment placed into service throughout  as well as additional equipment purchased in  depreciation and amortization expense related to assets associated with businesses acquired in  some of which did not contribute depreciation expense for the full year ended december  due to the timing of the acquisitions  and an increase in amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired in business combinations in as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization expense increased to from for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue to continue to remain higher than in recent periods due to the significant investment in capital expenditures made throughout the last three years and the overall decline in activity levels that began in late fixed asset and other intangible impairment loss for the year ended december   we recorded a fixed asset and other intangible impairment loss of million 
we recorded a charge of million related to our contract drilling business in the third quarter of after determining that the carrying value of certain of these drilling rigs exceeded the undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets and the fair market value estimates for these assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment of intangible assets of million related to our completion and production business 
we recorded no such expense in 
table of contents goodwill impairment loss we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of million for the year ended december  compared to million recorded in these write downs of goodwill in both and were associated with several of our reporting units and were based upon a discounted cash flow analysis of expected future earnings associated with these businesses 
our analysis of future cash flows was impacted significantly by the overall decline in oilfield activity in late which continued throughout interest expense interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease in interest expense was attributable primarily to a decrease in the average amount of debt outstanding during the year ended december  and lower interest rates in compared to on our outstanding borrowings under revolving credit facilities  which were fully repaid as of june  the weighted average interest rate of borrowings outstanding at december  and was approximately and  respectively 
taxes tax expense benefit is comprised of current income taxes and deferred income taxes 
the current and deferred taxes added together provide an indication of an effective rate of income tax 
we recorded a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  at an effective rate of approximately 
the lower effective tax rate in was due to the impairment of goodwill with limited tax basis 
our tax rate for the year ended december  was impacted significantly by a million impairment of goodwill which had a limited tax basis  as the majority of the goodwill arose through stock purchase transactions with little or no tax basis

year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue revenue from continuing operations for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to  million from  million for the year ended december  this increase by segment was as follows completion and production services 
segment revenue increased million  or  primarily due to revenues earned as a result of additional capital investment in our pressure pumping  coiled tubing  well servicing  rental and fluid handling businesses in and we experienced favorable results for our pressure pumping  fluid handling  well service and us and mexican coiled tubing businesses when comparing to revenues for our pressure pumping business increased due to the successful integration of a business acquired in april  and the expansion of services into the bakken shale area of north dakota 
during and  we completed a series of small acquisitions which provided incremental revenues for compared to due to the timing of those acquisitions 
revenue increases were partially offset by a general decline in oilfield activity which began during the fourth quarter of and pricing pressures in certain service offerings during the latter half of and throughout drilling services 
segment revenue increased million  or  for the year  primarily due to higher utilization rates and additional capital invested in our contract drilling business in and in early  we experienced lower pricing for our drilling services and lower utilization rates in our rig logistics operations primarily due to an increase in equipment placed into service by our competitors 
however  utilization improved during the second and third quarters of  before declining in the fourth quarter due to a general decline in oilfield activity by our customers 

table of contents product sales

completion and production services 
the increase in service and product expenses as a percentage of revenue for this business segment reflects pricing pressure for many of our service lines throughout  resulting in less favorable operating margins on a year over year basis 
we incurred higher labor and fuel costs during  although fuel costs began to decline in the fourth quarter of  and we incurred higher sand and cement costs in our pressure pumping business 
start up costs associated with mobilizing a frac fleet in the bakken shale area of north dakota also impacted our operating margins 
cost increases were partially offset by the mix of services provided in compared to  a full year s benefit of capital invested throughout  additional equipment placed into service during and several acquisitions 
in late  we experienced lower utilization rates and an increase in pricing pressure in several service lines due to a general decline in oilfield activity  which may stem from lower commodity prices and concerns over the broader us economy and the availability of credit for investment by our customers 
drilling services 
the increase in service and product expenses as a percentage of revenue for this business segment represented a decline in margin during compared to due to lower pricing for our contract drilling and drilling logistics businesses on a year over year basis  higher operating costs associated primarily with labor and fuel  and lower utilization of our equipment due primarily to more market competition 
product sales 
the increase in service and product expenses as a percentage of revenue for the products segments was primarily due to the mix of products sold  specifically the timing of equipment sales and refurbishment associated with our southeast asian operations which tend to be project specific and can fluctuate between periods depending upon the nature of the projects in process  and third party repair and fabrication work performed at our shop in north texas 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries and other related expenses for our selling  administrative  finance  information technology and human resource functions 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  to million from 
table of contents million during the year ended december  these expense increases included costs associated with businesses acquired in  including additional employee headcount  property rental expense and insurance expense  costs associated with acquisitions  which provided a full year of selling  general and administrative expense for  incremental costs of approximately million related to stock based compensation in compared to the prior year  and costs associated with the retirement of an executive officer during the fourth quarter of and other severance costs

in addition  we recorded depreciation and amortization expense related to businesses acquired in and  as well as assets purchased and placed into service throughout  which contributed a full year of depreciation expense in compared to a partial year of depreciation expense in in addition  we incurred incremental amortization expense associated with intangible assets related to businesses acquired in  particularly customer relationship intangibles which totaled million 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization expense increased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  impairment loss we recorded an impairment loss of million related to the write down of goodwill associated with several of our reporting units based upon a discounted cash flow analysis of expected future earnings associated with these businesses 
this analysis was impacted significantly by the overall decline in oilfield activity in late and the expected slowdown in activities in the short term  due in part to concerns of excess supply of commodities  a general decline in the us economy and concerns over the availability of credit for our customers to continue investment in drilling and exploration activities in the short term 
we recorded an impairment charge of million for the year ended december  related to our canadian operations 
interest expense interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense was attributable primarily to a decline in the average borrowing rate in for variable rate borrowings  primarily our revolving credit facilities in the us and canada 
this decline in the average borrowing rate was partially offset by an increase in the average debt balance outstanding throughout as compared to these borrowings were used primarily for business acquisitions and equipment purchases during the weighted average interest rate of borrowings outstanding at december  and was approximately and  respectively 
taxes tax expense is comprised of current income taxes and deferred income taxes 
the current and deferred taxes added together provide an indication of an effective rate of income tax 
our tax rate for the year ended december  was impacted significantly by a million impairment of goodwill which had a limited tax basis  as the majority of the goodwill arose through stock purchase transactions with little or no tax basis 
we received no tax benefit from the million impairment of goodwill recorded at december  excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charges  our effective tax rates for the years ended december  and would have been and  respectively 
the difference in the tax rates was attributable to the impact of the domestic production activities deduction and the effect of changes in earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate

on december   we acquired the remaining interest in this company 
liquidity and capital resources the recent and unprecedented disruption in the credit markets has had a significant adverse impact on the availability of credit from a number of financial institutions 
we are not currently a party to any interest rate swaps  currency hedges or derivative contracts of any type and have no exposure to commercial paper or auction rate securities markets 
we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the overall health of the credit markets 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty the impact that any further disruption in the credit environment would have on us 
we had cash and cash equivalents at december  and of million and million  respectively 
our primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures and general working capital 
in addition  we have historically obtained capital to fund strategic business acquisitions 
our primary sources of funds have been cash flow from operations  proceeds from borrowings under bank credit facilities  a private placement of debt that was subsequently exchanged for publicly registered debt and the issuance of equity securities in our initial public offering 
we anticipate that we will rely on cash generated from operations  borrowings under our amended revolving credit facility  future debt offerings and or future public equity offerings to satisfy our liquidity needs 
we believe that funds from these sources  or funds received from our newly amended credit facility  will be sufficient to meet both our short term working capital requirements and our long term capital requirements 
if our plans or assumptions change  or are inaccurate  or if we make further acquisitions  we may have to raise additional capital 
our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and to make acquisitions will depend upon our future operating performance  and more broadly  on the availability of equity and debt financing  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry  and general financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
in addition  new debt obtained could include service requirements based on higher interest paid and shorter maturities and could impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition 
the issuance of additional equity securities could result in significant dilution to stockholders 
on october   we completed an amendment to our existing revolving credit facilities the third amendment which modified the structure of the credit facility to an asset based facility subject to borrowing base restrictions 
this amendment provided us with less restrictive financial debt covenants and reduced borrowing capacity under the facility 
we believe the amended revolving credit facility will allow us to better manage our cash flow needs  provide greater certainty of access to funds in the future and allow us to use our asset base for future financing needs 
the following table summarizes cash flows by type for the periods indicated in thousands year ended december  revised revised cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in operating cash flows for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to lower sales in resulting from the general slowdown of activity in the oil and gas industry which started in the fourth quarter of

net cash used in investing activities decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  and increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  of this decrease  million was due to a reduction in the funds used to invest in capital equipment  which was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we decreased our overall capital expenditures in in response to the decline in commodity prices and lower activity levels 
in addition  we invested million in business acquisitions in  with no corresponding business acquisitions in  and we received million as proceeds from the sale of a discontinued operation in may for the year ended december   we invested million in capital equipment and million in business acquisitions

the source of funds for this net repayment in was cash flow from operations and funds received from the sale of a discontinued operation in borrowings were used to fund capital expenditures  business acquisitions and general corporate needs 
the source of cash for the year ended december  was borrowings under debt facilities to fund investment in equipment and acquisitions 
in  we focused on eliminating obligations under our credit facility and building cash 
our long term debt balances  including current maturities  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we spent significantly less than we have in recent years for investment in capital expenditures and acquisitions  during the year ended december  we anticipate our capital expenditures will increase in and we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of complementary companies 
we believe that our operating cash flows and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next months 
dividends we did not pay dividends on our par value common stock during the years ended december   and we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future  but rather plan to reinvest such funds in our business

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements and authoritative literature in december  the fasb issued additional guidance regarding business combinations that replaced the initial statement in its entirety 
the guidance now additionally requires that all assets and liabilities and non controlling interests of an acquired business be measured at their fair value  with limited exceptions  including the recognition of acquisition related costs and anticipated restructuring costs separate from the acquired net assets 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing pre acquisition contingencies and states that an acquirer must recognize assets and liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date  measured at acquisition date fair values  but must recognize all other contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date  measured at their acquisition date fair values only if it is more likely than not that these contingencies meet the definition of an asset or liability 
furthermore  this statement provides guidance for measuring goodwill and recording a bargain purchase  defined as a business combination in which total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any non controlling interest in the acquiree  and it requires that the acquirer recognize that excess in earnings as a gain attributable to the acquirer 
in april  the fasb issued a further update regarding accounting for assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arises from contingencies which amends the previous guidance to require contingent assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination to be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be reasonably estimated during the measurement period 
if fair value cannot be reasonably estimated during the measurement period  the contingent asset or liability would be recognized in accordance with us gaap to account for contingencies and reasonable estimation of the amount of loss  if any 
further  this update eliminated the specific subsequent accounting guidance for contingent assets and liabilities  without significantly revising the original guidance 
however  contingent consideration arrangements of an acquiree assumed by the acquirer in a business combination would still be initially and subsequently measured at fair value 
we adopted this additional guidance regarding business combinations on january  with no impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued guidance which established accounting and reporting standards for non controlling interests  formerly referred to as minority interests 
this guidance requires separate presentation of the non controlling interest as a component of equity on the balance sheet  and that net income be presented prior to adjustment for the non controlling interests portion of earnings with the portion of net income attributable to the parent company and the non controlling interest both presented on the face of the statement of operations 
we determined that this guidance had no impact on our financial statements for the years ended december  and  and no material impact for the year ended december  therefore  no presentation changes have been made to the consolidated financial statements relating to non controlling interest 
in september  the fasb issued guidance regarding the reporting of discontinued operations which clarified the definition of a discontinued operation as either a component of an entity which has been disposed of or classified as held for sale which meets the criteria of an operating segment  or as a business which meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale on acquisition 
this proposed guidance further modifies certain disclosure requirements 
we are currently evaluating the effect this proposed guidance may have on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued a standard regarding subsequent events that provides guidance as when an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after a balance sheet date in its financial statements and the necessary disclosures related to these events 
specifically  the entity should recognize subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date  including significant estimates used to prepare financial statements 
an entity must disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated and whether that date is the date the financial statements were issued or the date the financial statements were available to be issued 
we adopted this new accounting standard effective june  and have applied its provisions prospectively 
in august  the fasb further updated the fair value measurement guidance to clarify how an entity should measure liabilities at fair value 
the update reaffirms fair value is based on an orderly transaction between market participants  even though liabilities are infrequently transferred due to contractual or other legal restrictions 
however  identical liabilities traded in the active market should be used when available 
when quoted prices are not available  the quoted price of the identical liability traded as an asset  quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities traded as an asset  or another valuation approach should be used 
this update also clarifies that restrictions 
table of contents preventing the transfer of a liability should not be considered as a separate input or adjustment in the measurement of fair value 
we adopted the provisions of this update for fair value measurements of liabilities effective october   with no material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the demand  pricing and terms for oil and gas services provided by us are largely dependent upon the level of activity for the us and canadian gas industry 
industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control  including  but not limited to the supply of and demand for oil and gas  the level of prices  and expectations about future prices  of oil and gas  the cost of exploring for  developing  producing and delivering oil and gas  the expected rates of declining current production  the discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves  available pipeline and other transportation capacity  weather conditions  domestic and worldwide economic conditions  political instability in oil producing countries  technical advances affecting energy consumption  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the ability of oil and gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing  and merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers 
the level of activity in the us and canadian oil and gas exploration and production industry is volatile 
no assurance can be given that our expectations of trends in oil and gas production activities will reflect actual future activity levels or that demand for our services will be consistent with the general activity level of the industry 
any prolonged substantial reduction in oil and gas prices would likely affect oil and gas exploration and development efforts and therefore affect demand for our services 
a material decline in oil and gas prices or us and canadian activity levels could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for the years ended december  and  approximately of our revenues from continuing operations and and of our total assets  respectively  were denominated in canadian dollars  our functional currency in canada 
as a result  a material decrease in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar may negatively impact our revenues  cash flows and net income 
each one percentage point change in the value of the canadian dollar would have impacted our revenues for the year ended december  by approximately million  or million net of tax 
we do not currently use hedges or forward contracts to offset this risk 
our mexican operation uses the us dollar as its functional currency  and as a result  all transactions and translation gains and losses are recorded currently in the financial statements 
the balance sheet amounts are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate at the end of the month and the income statement amounts are translated at the average exchange rate for the month 
we estimate that a hypothetical one percentage point change in the value of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar would have impacted our revenues for the year ended december  by approximately million  or million  net of tax 
currently  we conduct a portion of our business in mexico in the local currency  the mexican peso
