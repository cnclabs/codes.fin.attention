metal connectors  anchors and fasteners will corrode and lose load carrying capacity when installed in corrosive environments or exposed to corrosive materials 
there are many environments and materials that may cause corrosion  including ocean salt air  fire retardants  preservative treated wood  dissimilar metals  fumes and fertilizers 
the variables present in a single building environment make it impossible to predict accurately if  or when  significant corrosion will begin or reach a critical level 
this relative uncertainty makes it crucial that the specifiers be knowledgeable of the potential risks and select a product coating or metal that is suitable for the intended use 
changes in the preservative treated wood industry have created additional concerns 
effective december   the preservative treated wood industry voluntarily transitioned from chromated copper arsenate cca c used in residential applications to alternative treatments 
testing has shown that certain alternative replacement treatments are generally more corrosive than cca c 
sst publishes technical bulletins on subjects such as this and others that affect the installation and use of its products

sdv also uses raw materials such as aluminum  aluminum alloys and ceramic and other insulation materials  and both sst and sdv use cartons 
the company purchases raw materials from a variety of commercial sources 
the company s practice is to seek cost savings and enhanced quality by purchasing from a limited number of suppliers 
the steel industry is highly cyclical and prices for the company s raw materials are influenced by numerous factors beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions  competition  labor costs  foreign exchange rates  import duties  raw material shortages and trade restrictions 
the steel market continues to be dynamic  with a high degree of uncertainty about future pricing trends 
steel prices have declined from their peak in july  but the company believes that they may have reached a low point in mid and that they may increase in as demand returns to the market and imports and steel mill capacity utilization remain constricted 
demand for steel  although slow  increased due to manufacturers low inventories in the fourth quarter of numerous factors may cause steel prices to increase in the future 
in addition to increases in steel prices  mills have added surcharges for zinc  energy and freight in response to increases in their costs 
these and other factors could adversely affect the company s cost and access to steel in if steel prices increase and the company is not able to maintain its prices or increase them sufficiently  the company s margins could deteriorate 
see item a risk factors and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company historically has not attempted to hedge against changes in prices of steel or other raw materials 
patents and proprietary rights the company s subsidiaries have united states and foreign patents  the majority of which cover products that they currently manufacture and market 
these patents  and applications for new patents  cover various design aspects of the subsidiaries products  as well as processes used in their manufacture 
the company s subsidiaries are continuing to develop new potentially patentable products  product enhancements and product designs 
although the company s subsidiaries do not intend to apply for additional foreign patents covering existing products  the company has developed an international patent program to protect new products that its subsidiaries may develop 
in addition to seeking patent protection  the company relies on unpatented proprietary technology to maintain its competitive position

item a 
risk factors 
you should carefully consider the following risks before you decide to buy or hold shares of our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  results of operations or financial condition would likely suffer 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our stock 
this and other public reports may contain forward looking statements based on current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about us and our industry 
those forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those forward looking statements as a result of many factors  as more fully described below and elsewhere in our public reports 
we do not undertake to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
worldwide economic conditions and credit tightening materially and adversely affect our business 
our business has been materially and adversely affected by changes in regional  national or global economic conditions 
such changes have included or may include reduced consumer spending  reduced availability of capital  inflation  deflation  adverse changes in interest rates  reduced energy availability and increased energy costs  and government initiatives to manage economic conditions 
continuing instability in financial markets and the deterioration of other national and global economic conditions may have further materially adverse effects on our operations  financial results or liquidity  including the following the financial stability of our customers or suppliers may be compromised  which could result in additional bad debts for us or non performance by suppliers  financial instability of the financial institutions where we have our cash balances invested could result in loss of our principal balance  one or more of the financial institutions that make available our revolving credit facility may become unable to fulfill their funding obligations  which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity  it may become even more costly or difficult for us to obtain the agreed or additional financing or to refinance our existing credit facility  or our assets may be impaired or subject to write down or write off 
uncertainty about current global economic conditions may cause consumers of our products to postpone or refrain from spending in response to tighter credit  negative financial news  declines in income or asset values  or other adverse economic events or conditions  which could materially reduce demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
further deterioration of economic conditions would likely exacerbate these adverse effects  result in wide ranging  adverse and prolonged effects on general business conditions  and materially and adversely affect our operations  financial results and liquidity 
failure to comply with industry regulations could result in reduced sales and increased costs 
the design  capacity and quality of most of our products and manufacturing processes are subject to numerous and extensive regulations and standards promulgated by governmental  quasi governmental and industry organizations 
these regulations and standards are highly technical  complex and subject to frequent revision 
if our products or manufacturing processes fail to comply with any regulations or standards  we may not be able to manufacture and market our products profitably 
failure to comply with regulations and standards could therefore materially reduce our sales and increase our costs 
if we fail to compete effectively  our revenue and profit margins could decline 
we face a variety of competition in all of the markets in which we participate 
many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
in addition  other technologies may be the bases for competitive products that could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
other companies may find our markets attractive and enter those markets 
competitive pricing  including price competition or the introduction of new products  could have material adverse effects on our revenues and profit margins 
our ability to compete effectively depends to a significant extent on the specification or approval of our products by architects  engineers  building inspectors  building code officials and customers 
if a significant segment of those communities were to decide that the design  materials  manufacturing  testing or quality control of our products is inferior to that of any of our competitors  our sales and profits would be materially reduced 
if we lose all or part of a large customer  our sales and profits would decline 
we have substantial sales to a few large customers 
loss of all or part of our sales to a large customer would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits 
our largest customer accounted for of net sales for the year ended december   and slightly less than of net sales for the year ended december  in august  this customer sold a division  which is now a separate customer of the company 
as a combined company in  these two customers accounted for of our net sales 
as two separate customers  neither would have accounted for more than of our consolidated net sales for see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
this customer may endeavor to replace  in some or all markets  our products with lower priced products supplied by others or may otherwise reduce its purchases of our products 
we also might reduce our dependence on our largest customer by reducing or terminating sales to one or more of the customer s subsidiaries 
any reduction in  or termination of  our sales to this customer would at least temporarily  and possibly longer  cause a material reduction in our net sales  income from operations and net income 
a reduction in or elimination of our sales to our largest customer  or another of our larger customers  would increase our relative dependence on our remaining large customers 
in addition  our customers include retailers and distributors 
retail and distribution businesses have consolidated over time  which could increase the material adverse effect of losing any of them 
increases in prices of raw materials could negatively affect our sales and profits 
our principal raw material is steel  including stainless steel 
the steel industry is highly cyclical 
numerous factors beyond our control  such as general economic conditions  competition  worldwide demand  material and labor costs  energy costs  foreign exchange rates  import duties and other trade restrictions  influence prices for our raw materials 
consolidation among domestic integrated steel producers  changes in supply and demand in steel markets  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions  and other events have led to volatility in steel costs 
the domestic steel market is heavily influenced by three major united states manufacturers 
we have not always been able  and in the future we might not be able  to increase our product prices in amounts that correspond to increases in costs of raw materials  without materially and adversely affecting our sales and profits 
we have not attempted to hedge against changes in prices of steel or other raw materials 
in recent years  however  we have increased our steel purchases in an effort to mitigate the effects of rising steel prices 
at the same time  since our sales have declined with the declines in the housing and financial markets 
as a result  our inventory fluctuated substantially 
inventory fluctuation can materially and adversely affect our margins  cash flow and profits 
if we cannot protect our technology  we will not be able to compete effectively 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology  in part through patents 
we might not be able to protect or rely on our patents 
patents might not issue pursuant to pending patent applications 
others might independently develop the same or similar technology  develop around the patented aspects of any of our products or proposed products  or otherwise obtain access to or circumvent our proprietary technology 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology to maintain our competitive position 
we might not be able to protect our know how or other proprietary information 
if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our significant products  our sales and profits could be materially reduced 
in attempting to protect our proprietary information  we sometimes initiate lawsuits against competitors and others that we believe have infringed or are infringing our rights 
in such an event  the defendant may assert counterclaims to complicate or delay the litigation or for other reasons 
litigation may be very costly and may result in adverse judgments that affect our sales and profits materially and adversely 
integrating acquired businesses may divert management s attention away from our day to day operations 
we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  for example difficulties assimilating the operations and products of acquired businesses  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  overvaluation of acquired businesses  undisclosed existing or potential liabilities of acquired businesses  slow acceptance or rejection of acquired businesses products by our customers  risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience  litigation involving activities  properties or products of acquired businesses  consumer and other claims related to products of acquired businesses  and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses 
in addition  future acquisitions may cause us to issue additional equity securities that dilute the value of our existing equity securities  increase our debt  and cause impairment and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 
any acquisition could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
significant costs to integrate our acquired operations may negatively affect our financial condition and the market price of our stock 
we will incur costs from integrating acquired business operations  products and personnel 
these costs may be significant and may include expenses and other liabilities for employee redeployment  relocation or severance  combining teams and processes in various functional areas  reorganization or closures of facilities  and relocation or disposition of excess equipment 
the integration costs that we incur may negatively affect our profitability and the market price of our stock 
our future growth may depend on our ability to penetrate new domestic and international markets  which could reduce our profitability 
international construction customs  standards  techniques and methods differ from those in the united states 
laws and regulations applicable in new markets may be unfamiliar to us 
compliance may be substantially more costly than we anticipate 
as a result  we may need to redesign products  or invent or design new products  to compete effectively and profitably in new markets 
we expect that we will need significant time  which may be years  to generate substantial sales or profits in new markets 
other significant challenges to conducting business in foreign countries include  among other factors  local acceptance of our products  political instability  changes in import and export regulations  changes in tariff and freight rates  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and currency controls 
we might not be able to penetrate these markets and any market penetration that occurs might not be timely or profitable 
if we do not penetrate these markets within a reasonable time  we will be unable to recoup part or all of the significant investments we will have made in attempting to do so 
seasons and business cycles affect our operating results 
our sales are seasonal  with operating results varying from quarter to quarter 
with some exceptions  our sales and income have historically been lower in the first and fourth quarters than in the second and third quarters of the year  as customers purchase construction materials in the late spring and summer months for the construction season 
in addition  weather conditions  such as unseasonably warm  cold or wet weather  which affect  and sometimes delay or accelerate  installation of some of our products  significantly affect our results of operations 
political and economic events can also affect our sales and profitability 
we have little control over the timing of customer purchases 
sales that we anticipate in one quarter may occur in another quarter  affecting both quarters results 
in addition  we incur significant expenses as we develop  produce and market our products in anticipation of future orders 
we maintain high inventory levels and typically ship orders as we receive them  so we operate with little backlog 
as a result  net sales in any quarter generally depend on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
a significant portion of our operating expenses is fixed 
planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
when sales do not meet our expectations  our operating results will be reduced for the relevant quarters  as we will have already incurred expenses based on those expectations 
our principal markets are in the building construction industry 
that industry is subject to significant volatility due to real estate market cycles  fluctuations in interest rates  the availability  or lack thereof  of credit to builders and developers  inflation rates  weather  and other factors and trends 
none of these factors or trends is within our control 
declines in commercial and residential construction  such as housing starts  and remodeling projects have reduced  and in the future can be expected to reduce  the demand for our products 
negative economic or construction industry performance adversely affects our business 
declines in construction activity or demand for our products have materially and adversely affected  and could in the future materially and adversely affect  our sales and profitability 
product liability claims and product recalls could harm our reputation  sales and financial condition 
we design and manufacture most of our standard products and expect to continue to do so  although we buy raw materials and some manufactured products from others 
we have on occasion found flaws and deficiencies in the manufacturing  design or testing of our products 
we also have on occasion found flaws and deficiencies in raw materials and finished goods produced by others 
some flaws and deficiencies have not been apparent until after the products were installed by customers 
many of our products are integral to the structural soundness or safety of the structures in which they are used 
if any flaws or deficiencies exist in our products and if such flaws or deficiencies are not discovered and corrected before our products are incorporated into structures  the structures could be unsafe or could suffer severe damage  such as collapse or fire  and personal injury could result 
errors in the installation of our products  even if the products are free of flaws and deficiencies  could also cause personal injury and unsafe structural conditions 
to the extent that such damage or injury is not covered by our product liability insurance and we are held to be liable  we could be required to correct such damage and to compensate persons who might have suffered injury  and our reputation  business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
even if a flaw or deficiency is discovered before any damage or injury occurs  we may need to recall products  and we may be liable for any costs necessary to replace recalled products or retrofit the affected structures 
any such recall or retrofit could entail substantial costs and adversely affect our reputation  sales and financial condition 
we do not carry insurance against recall costs or the adverse business effect of a recall  and our product liability insurance may not cover retrofit costs 
claims resulting from a natural disaster might be made against us with regard to damage or destruction of structures incorporating our products 
any such claims  if asserted  could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
complying or failing to comply with environmental  health and safety laws and regulations could affect us materially and adversely 
we are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing emissions into the air  discharges into water  and generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
we are also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters 
our manufacturing operations involve the use of solvents  chemicals  oils and other materials that are regarded as hazardous or toxic 
we also use complex and heavy machinery and equipment that can pose severe safety hazards  especially if not properly and carefully used 
some of our products also incorporate materials that are hazardous or toxic in some forms  such as zinc and lead used in some steel galvanizing processes and chemicals used in our acrylic and epoxy anchoring products 
the gun powder used in our powder actuated tools is explosive 
misuse of other materials in some of our products could also cause injury or sickness 
if we do not obtain all material licenses and permits required by environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  we may be subject to regulatory action by governmental authorities 
if our policies and procedures do not comply in all respects with existing environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  our activities might violate such laws and regulations 
even if our policies and procedures do comply  but our employees fail or neglect to follow them in all respects  we might incur similar liability 
relevant laws and regulations could change or new ones could be adopted that require us to obtain additional licenses and permits and cause us to incur substantial expense 
our generation  handling  use  storage  transportation  treatment or disposal of hazardous or toxic materials  machinery and equipment might cause injury to persons or to the environment 
we may need to take remedial action if properties that we occupy are contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances 
any change in laws or regulations  any legal or regulatory violations  or any contamination  could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
new appliance efficiency standards could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the department of energy regulates energy efficiency under the authority of the national appliance energy conservation act 
under this act  the department of energy periodically reviews the need for increased efficiency standards with respect to gas furnaces and gas water heaters 
a substantial percentage of our type b gas vent sales are for gas furnaces and gas water heaters 
the department of energy might adopt minimum appliance efficiency standards that negatively affect sales of type b gas vents  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we depend on key management and technical personnel  the loss of whom could harm our business 
we depend on certain key management and technical personnel  including  among others  thomas j fitzmyers  michael j 
herbert  phillip terry kingsfather  barclay simpson  stephen p 
eberhard  karen colonias and jeffrey e 
mackenzie 
the loss of one or more key employees could materially and adversely affect us 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified technical  marketing and management personnel necessary for the maintenance and expansion of our activities 
we face strong competition for such personnel 
we might not be able to attract or retain such personnel 
in addition  when we experience periods with little or no profits  a decrease in compensation based on our profits may make it difficult to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
any work stoppage or interruption by employees could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
a significant number of our employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements that will expire in and a work stoppage or interruption by a significant number of our employees could have a material and adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
international operations expose us to foreign exchange rate risk 
we have foreign exchange rate risk in our international operations and through purchases from foreign vendors 
we do not currently hedge this risk 
changes in currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales and profitability 
natural disasters could decrease our manufacturing capacity 
most of our current and planned manufacturing facilities are located in geographic regions that have experienced major natural disasters  such as earthquakes  floods and hurricanes 
for example  the earthquakes in northridge  california  in january  destroyed several freeways and numerous buildings in the region in which our facilities in brea are located 
our disaster recovery plan may not be adequate or effective 
we do not carry earthquake insurance 
other insurance that we carry is limited in the risks covered and the amount of coverage 
our insurance would not be adequate to cover all of our resulting costs  business interruption and lost profits when a major natural disaster occurs 
a natural disaster rendering one or more of our manufacturing facilities totally or partially unusable  whether or not covered by insurance  would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
control by our principal stockholder reduces the ability of other stockholders to influence management 
barclay simpson  the chairman of our board of directors  controls approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
mr 
simpson and thomas j fitzmyers  our president and chief executive officer even though he owns less than of the outstanding shares of our common stock  have significant influence with respect to the election of our directors and over some fundamental changes affecting us  such as a merger or sale of assets or amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws 
additional financing  if needed  to fund our working capital  growth or acquisitions may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
if our cash requirements for working capital or to fund our growth increase to a level that exceeds the amount of cash that we generate from operations  or if we should decide to make an acquisition that requires more cash than we have available internally and through our current credit arrangements  we will need to seek additional resources 
in that event  we may need to enter into additional or new borrowing arrangements or consider equity financing 
additional or new borrowings may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  especially under current conditions in the financial markets 
our ability to raise money by selling and issuing shares of our common or preferred stock would depend on general market conditions and the demand for our stock 
we may be unable to raise adequate capital on reasonable terms by selling stock 
if we sell stock  our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution 
our inability to secure additional financing could prevent the expansion of our business  internally and through acquisitions 
any issuance of preferred stock may dilute your investment and reduce funds available for dividends 
our board of directors is authorized by our certificate of incorporation to determine the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and to authorize the issuance of shares of any such series on such terms as our board of directors may approve 
any such issuance could be used to impede an acquisition of our business that our board of directors does not approve  further dilute the equity investments of holders of our common stock and reduce funds available for the payment of dividends to holders of our common stock 
our stock price is likely to be volatile and could drop 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to period to period variations in operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the construction and construction materials industries  relatively low trading volume in our common stock and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market is subject to extreme price fluctuations 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
securities market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
future sales of common stock could adversely affect our stock price 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock 
all of the outstanding shares of our common stock are freely tradable without restriction under the securities act of  other than million shares held as of february  by our affiliates  as that term is defined in rule under the securities act of options to purchase million shares of our common stock were outstanding as of december   including options to purchase million shares that were exercisable 
if a substantial number of shares were sold in the public market pursuant to rule or on exercise of options  the trading price of our common stock in the public market could be adversely affected 
delaware law and our stockholder rights plan contain anti takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
section of the delaware general corporation law may make the acquisition of simpson manufacturing co  inc and the removal of incumbent officers and directors more difficult by prohibiting stockholders holding or more of our outstanding voting stock from acquiring simpson manufacturing co  inc without the consent of our board of directors for at least three years from the date they first hold or more of the voting stock 
barclay simpson and his affiliates are not subject to this provision of delaware law with respect to their investment in simpson manufacturing co  inc in addition  our stockholder rights plan has significant anti takeover effects by causing substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
we are subject to a number of significant risks that might cause our actual results to vary materially from our plans  targets or projections  including lack of market acceptance of new products  failing to develop new products with significant market potential  increased labor costs  including significant increases in worker s compensation insurance premiums and health care benefits  failing to increase  or even maintain  sales and profits  failing to anticipate  appropriately invest in and effectively manage the human  information technology and logistical resources necessary to support the growth of our business  including managing the costs associated with such resources  failing to integrate  leverage and generate expected rates of return on investments  including expansion of existing businesses and expansion through acquisitions  failing to generate sufficient future positive operating cash flows and  if necessary  secure adequate external financing to fund our growth  and interruptions in service by common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels 
if we change significantly the location  nature or extent of some of our manufacturing operations  we may reduce our net income 
if we decide to change significantly the location  nature or extent of a portion of our manufacturing operations  we may need to record an impairment of our goodwill 
our goodwill totaled million at december  recording an impairment of our goodwill correspondingly reduces our net income 
in  for example  we decided to move part of our canadian manufacturing operations to china in or  and as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment of million  which materially reduced our net income in other changes or events in the future could further impair our recorded goodwill  which could also materially and adversely affect our profitability 
impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or at any time when events occur that could affect the value of our business segments 
to determine whether a goodwill impairment has occurred  we compare fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying value 
significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances  such as significant adverse changes in business climate  adverse actions by regulatory authorities  unanticipated competition  loss of key customers or changes in technology or markets  can require a charge for impairment that can materially and adversely affect our reported net income and our stockholders equity 
for example  in  our annual impairment test resulted in goodwill impairment charge of million associated with assets acquired in england in as part of our uk reporting unit 
our uk reporting unit s carrying value exceeded its fair value  primarily due to reduced future expected net cash flows 
if current adverse conditions in the home building industry  the financial markets or the economy generally should continue longer than we expect  we may need to take further charges for impairment  which we are not now able to estimate  but which may be substantial 
failure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results 
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions  providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the consolidated financial statements  providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization  and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
because of the inherent limitations of internal control  our internal control over financial reporting might not detect or prevent misstatement of our consolidated financial statements 
our growth and entry into new  globally dispersed markets puts significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting 
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud 
failure of our accounting systems could harm our business and financial results 
we have implemented a new commercially available microsoft third party accounting software system  initially focused on replacing our internally developed general ledger and purchasing and payables systems  for use in our operations in the united states  europe and asia 
any errors or defects in  or unavailability of  third party software or our implementation of the systems  could result in errors in our financial statements  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
if we continue to use our other internally developed accounting systems and they are not able to accommodate our future business needs  or if we find that they or any new systems we may implement contain errors or defects  our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our international operations may be materially and adversely affected by factors beyond our control 
economic  social and political conditions  laws  practices and customs vary widely among the countries where we produce or sell our products 
our operations outside of the united states are subject to a number of risks and potential costs  including  for example  lower profit margins  less protection of intellectual property and economic  political and social uncertainty in some countries  especially in china and other emerging markets 
our sales and profits depend  in part  on our ability to develop and implement policies and strategies that effectively anticipate and manage these and other risks in the countries where we do business 
these and other risks may have a material adverse effect on our operations in any particular country and on our business as a whole 
inflation in emerging markets also makes our products more expensive there and increases the market and credit risks to which we are exposed 
our international operations depend on our successful management of our subsidiaries outside of the united states 
we conduct most of our international business through wholly owned subsidiaries 
managing distant subsidiaries and fully integrating them into our business is challenging 
we cannot directly supervise every aspect of the operations of our subsidiaries operating outside the united states 
as a result  we rely on local managers and staff 
cultural factors and language differences can result in misunderstandings among internationally dispersed personnel 
the risk that unauthorized conduct may go undetected may be greater in subsidiaries outside of the united states 
these problems could adversely affect our sales and profits 
our manufacturing facilities in china complicate our inventory management 
we maintain manufacturing capability in various parts of the world  in part to allow us to serve our customers with prompt delivery of needed products 
such customer service is a significant factor in our efforts to compete with larger companies that have greater resources than we have 
we have expanded  substantially  our manufacturing in china 
much of the output of our manufacturing in china is and will be intended for export to other parts of asia and elsewhere 
because of the unusually great distances between our manufacturing facilities in china and the markets to which the products made there will be shipped  we may have difficulty providing adequate service to our customers  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage 
our attempts to provide prompt delivery may necessitate that in china we produce and keep on hand substantially more inventory of finished products than would otherwise be needed 
inventory increases can materially and adversely affect our margins  cash flow and net income 
if we fail to keep pace with advances in our industry or fail to persuade customers to adopt new products we introduce  customers may not buy our products  which would adversely affect our sales and profits 
constant development of new technologies and techniques  frequent new product introductions and strong price competition characterize the construction industry 
the first company to introduce a new product or technique to the market gains a competitive advantage 
our future growth depends  in part  on our ability to develop products that are more effective  safer  or incorporate emerging technologies better than our competitors products 
sales of our existing products may decline rapidly if a competitor were to introduce superior products  or even if we announce a new product of our own 
if we fail to make sufficient investments in research and development or if we focus on technologies that do not lead to better products  our current and planned products could be surpassed by more effective or advanced products 
if we fail to manufacture our products economically and market them successfully  our sales and profits would be materially and adversely affected 
changes in accounting standards could materially and adversely affect our financial results 
the accounting rules applicable to public companies are subject to frequent revision 
future changes in accounting standards  guidance and interpretations could require us to change the way we measure revenue  expense or balance sheet amounts  which could result in material and adverse change to our reported results of operations or financial condition 
climate change could materially and adversely affect our business 
scientific reports indicate that  as a result of human activity temperatures around the world have been increasing and are likely to continue to increase as a result of increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other carbon compounds  the frequency and severity of storms  and flooding  are likely to increase  severe weather is likely to occur in places where the climate has historically been more mild  and average sea levels have risen and are likely to rise more  threatening worldwide coastal development 
we cannot predict the effects that these phenomena may have on our business 
they might  for example depress or reverse economic development  reduce the demand for construction  increase the cost and reduce the availability of fresh water  destroy forests  increasing the cost and reducing the availability of wood products used in construction  increase the cost and reduce the availability of raw materials and energy  increase the cost of capital  increase the cost and reduce the availability of insurance covering damage from natural disasters  lead to claims regarding the content or adequacy of our public disclosures  and lead to new laws and regulations that increase our expenses and reduce our sales 
any of these consequences  and other consequences of climate change that we do not foresee  could materially and adversely affect our sales  profits and financial condition 
we are subject to us and international tax laws that could affect our financial results 
we conduct international operations through our subsidiaries 
tax laws affecting international operations are complex and subject to change 
our income tax liabilities in the different countries where we operate depend in part on internal settlement prices and administrative charges among us and our subsidiaries 
these arrangements require us to make judgments with which tax authorities may disagree 
tax authorities may impose additional tariffs  duties  taxes  penalties and interest on us 
for example  we manufacture steel products in foreign countries for importation into the us and other countries  and government agencies may impose substantial prospective or retroactive tariffs on such products 
transactions that we have arranged in light of current tax rules could have material and adverse consequences if tax rules change  and changes in tax rules or imposition of any new or increased tariffs  duties and taxes could materially and adversely affect our sales  profits and financial condition 
contracts that we file as exhibits to our public reports contain recitals  representations and warranties that may not be factually correct 
any recital  representation  warranty or other statement of purported fact in any contract  agreement or similar instrument that we file as an exhibit to this or any other report may not be true or complete  either at the date of such instrument or at any later time 
even if such statements were accurate when made  they may not be accurate when we file the instrument as an exhibit to any of our reports 
the parties to such instruments did not intend such statements to establish or confirm any facts  but intended such statements to allocate contractual risk between the parties 
such instruments may be subject to standards of materiality that differ from the standards applicable to our reports 
in addition  such statements may have been qualified by schedules and other disclosures that we have not filed with or incorporated by reference into this or any other report or document 
in reviewing any of our reports  you should rely on the text of the report  which we believed was complete and correct in all material respects when we filed the report

the following is a discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the company for the years ended december   and  and of certain factors that may affect the company s prospective financial condition and results of operations 
the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere herein

net sales decreased in from in all regions of the united states  with above average rates of decline in california and the western portions of the country  and net sales to home centers decreased significantly over the same period 
expansion into international markets helped to offset in part the sales decline in the united states over the last three years 
sales outside of the united states have increased  due in part to the acquisitions of certain assets of liebig international ltd  an irish company  heinrich liebig stahld belwerke gmbh  liebig gmbh co 
kg and liebig international verwaltungsgesellschaft gmbh  all german companies  liebig bolts limited  an english company  and liebig international inc  a virginia corporation collectively liebig  in april  ahorn ger te werkzeuge vertriebs gmbh  a german company  and its subsidiaries ahorn upevnovaci technika sro  a czech company  and ahorn pacific fasteners kunshan co  ltd  a chinese company collectively ahorn  in july  and agence internationale commerciale et industrielle  sas  a french company aginco  in april gross profit margin decreased to in from in primarily due to increased costs of steel and other materials  a higher proportion of fixed overhead costs and higher distribution costs  partly offset by reduced labor costs 
in recent years  home center sales have declined  although at a lower rate than the company s consolidated net sales 
a large part of the home center sales was sales to the home depot  which exceeded of the company s consolidated net sales in the years ended december   and  but not in the year ended december  see item a risk factors and note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
consolidation of retailers and distributors has occurred over time 
while the consolidation of these large retailers and distributors provides the company with opportunities for growth  the increasing size and importance of individual customers exposes simpson strong tie to potential over dependence 
the loss of any of the larger home centers and distributors as customers would have a material adverse effect on sst  unless and until either such customers are replaced or sst makes the necessary adjustments if possible to compensate for the loss of business 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  the percentage of net sales of certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations

the company continues to face uncertainty in the cost and availability of steel 
several factors are contributing to this uncertainty 
the price of steel  the company s primary raw material  increased in the second half of the company expects steel prices to continue to increase into as demand returns to the market 
the steel market continues to be dynamic  however  with a high degree of uncertainty about future pricing trends 
if steel prices increase and the company is not able to maintain its prices or increase them sufficiently  the company s margins could deteriorate further

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was in  up from in the effective tax rate is higher than the statutory rate primarily due to the valuation allowances taken on foreign losses  differences between the us statutory tax rate and the local tax rate in countries where the company operates and a reduced benefit from the reduction or loss of enterprise zone tax credits at two of the company s facilities in california

critical accounting policies and estimates the critical policies described below affect the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
if the company s business conditions change or if it uses different assumptions or estimates in the application of these and other accounting policies  the company s future results of operations could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value market 
cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition  as follows raw materials and purchased finished goods principally valued at cost determined on a weighted average basis 
in process products and finished goods cost of direct materials and labor plus attributable overhead based on a normal level of activity 
the company writes the gross value of the inventory down to its net realizable value 
the company estimates net realizable value based on estimated selling price less further costs to completion and disposal 
the company impairs slow moving prod uct by comparing inventories on hand to future projected demand 
obsolete inventory is on hand supply of a product in excess of two years sales of that product or a supply of that product that the company believes is no longer marketable 
the company revalues obsolete inventory as having no net realizable value and impairs its full carrying value 
the company has consistently applied this methodology 
the company believes that this approach is prudent and makes suitable provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory 
when provisions are established  a new cost basis of the inventory is created 
comparable inventory values are as follows in thousands december  gross inventories raw materials in process products finished goods less slow moving  obsolete and net realizable value provisions net inventory valuation activity in the inventory reserve is summarized as follows in thousands years ended december  beginning balance provisions released following disposal of inventory additional provisions made ending balance unexpected change in market demand  building codes or buyer preferences could reduce the rate of inventory turnover and require the company to increase its reserve for obsolescence 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete  net of applicable provision for discounts  returns and incentives  whether actual or estimated based on the company s experience 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the sales agreement or purchase order  ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable 
the company s general shipping terms are fob shipping point  where title is transferred and revenue is recognized when the products are shipped to customers 
when the company sells fob destination point  title is transferred and the company recognizes revenue on delivery or customer acceptance  depending on terms of the sales agreement 
service sales  representing after market repair and maintenance  engineering activities and software sales and service  tho ugh significantly less than of net sales and not material to the consolidated financial statements  are recognized as the services are completed or the software products and services are delivered 
if actual costs of sales returns  incentives and discounts were to significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowance  the company s sales would be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company assesses the collectibility of specific customer accounts that would be considered doubtful based on the customer s financial condition  payment history  credit rating and other factors that the company considers relevant  or accounts that the company assigns for collection 
the company reserves for the portion of those outstanding balances that the company believes it is not likely to collect  based on historical collection experience 
the company also reserves of the amount that it deems potentially uncollectible due to a customer s bankruptcy or deteriorating financial condition 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is summarized as follows in thousands years ended december  beginning balance adjustments  recoveries and write offs increase to bad debt provision ending balance goodwill impairment testing the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the fasb asc requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter for the company and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  or disposition or relocation of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies or a combination of market approaches  if information is readily available  and discounted cash flow methodologies 
this process requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which depends on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for the company s business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of the company s weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those assumed 
the company has allocated goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit or units expected to benefit from the acquisition 
reporting units are generally determined based on product type and country or region of operations 
the impairment charge taken in  which was a result of the company s annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of  was associated with assets that were acquired in england in and was associated with the company s uk reporting unit 
the reporting unit s carrying value exceeded the fair value  primarily due to reduced future expected net cash flows 
the method to determine the fair value of the uk reporting unit was a discounted cash flow model 
in  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to its canadian reporting unit  resulting primarily from decreased expected future cash flows due to the move of production from canada to china 
the method to determine the fair value of the canadian reporting unit was a discounted cash flow model supported by market approaches  which were based on earnings multiples realized by similar public companies and on representative merger and acquisition transactions of a similar nature and industry 
at december   the remaining balances of goodwill of the uk and canadian reporting units were million and million  respectively 
these reporting units are associated with the connector products segment 
effect of new accounting standards on january   the company adopted new or revised guidance in the following fasb asc topics business combinations  intangibles goodwill and other  subsequent events  and generally accepted accounting principles
