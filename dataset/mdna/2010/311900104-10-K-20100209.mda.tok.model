item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
certain tabular information will not foot due to rounding 
business overview fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies 
we operate stores primarily located in north america 
on december   we operated  company owned or leased store locations 
most of our customers are in the manufacturing and construction markets 
the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations 
the construction market includes general  electrical  plumbing  sheet metal  and road contractors 
other users of our products include farmers  truckers  railroads  mining companies  federal  state  and local governmental entities  schools  and certain retail trades 
geographically  our customers are primarily located in north america 

table of contents similar to our first three quarterly reports in  this annual report s discussion contains some additional points not typically covered in our reports in previous years 
we believe these are important aspects that require added emphasis 
as we saw in the previous fifteen months  the weakened economy continues to have a substantial impact on our business 
these impacts continue to negatively affect our sales  particularly related to our industrial production business business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by others and  as the year progressed  our non residential construction business 
to place this in perspective sales to our manufacturing customers historically approximately of sales contracted approximately in the fourth quarter and for the year versus the same periods in this contraction is less severe in the maintenance portion of our manufacturing sales business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing  but more severe in the production business 
our non residential construction business historically to of sales contracted approximately in the fourth quarter and for the year versus the same periods in the remaining business sales to other resellers  government business  transportation warehousing  other industries  and in store retail sales produced better results as a group  but unfortunately  doesn t have enough impact to offset the manufacturing and construction impact 
the annual sales growth contraction compared to sales for the remaining business was as follows sales to other resellers contraction  government business growth  transportation warehousing contraction  all other industries combined growth  and in store retail sales contraction 
on a sequential basis  our daily average sales to our manufacturing customers improved each month since may with the exception of july and december due to the holiday impact versus the previous month 
this trend was the first sequential improvement since september however  this improvement was partially offset by continued weakening in our non residential construction business 
sometimes our comments are an effort to share our perspective regarding the trends with you  our shareholder 
the discussion above is an attempt to provide insight into activities with types of customers and the discussion under the headings financial overview and monthly daily sales change later gives a somewhat mechanical view of our business 
another way to think about our business is to compare our growth during a year to the act of climbing a stairway 
this stairway has several predictable landings ie april  july  and october to december  but generally speaking  climbs from january to october 
the october landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year 
history has identified these landings in our business cycle 
they generally relate to months with impaired business days ie certain holidays 
the first landing centers on easter  which alternates between march and april it was in april in  the second landing centers on july th  and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our construction business and on the christmas new year holidays 
the holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from month to month or because they move around during the week 
the table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales see definition of daily sales later in this report 
the line labeled past is an historical average of the results for the period to we chose this time frame because it had similar characteristics  a weaker industrial economy in north america  and could serve as a benchmark for a possible trend line 
the line is our actual results and the delta line is the difference between the past and

past delta the january figures represent the percentage change from the previous october  whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month 

table of contents in the october to january time frame  our economy dug a big hole  and pulled our sales results from daily average sales growth of in october to a contraction of in january 
the delta  or spread between the benchmark and the actual  in the february to april time frame averaged a negative 
this increased the daily sales contraction to in april 
the delta from may to july was not as significant  averaging a negative  while this period was still painful  it began to show what we believe was the bottom of the drop 
finally  in the period from august to december  the delta improved further  and averaged a positive 
historically  we are hesitant to provide much forward looking commentary as we believe we are better able to provide value to our shareholders by managing the business and not by trying to predict the economy  however  our confidence in our ability to see year over year sales growth in the near future is buoyed by these trends 
during  we attempted to balance long term opportunities for growth with the necessary short term reactions to the current reality 
in this regard  we previously slowed our store openings for to a range of to new stores and we stopped adding any headcount except for store openings and for stores that are growing 
over the last several years  our pathway to profit initiative has slowly altered our cost structure in that a greater portion is now variable versus fixed 
this continues to help us today as we navigate through the current economic environment 
as discussed in our third quarter report  we began to stabilize our store total headcount in that quarter and in october we began the steps to increase our rate of store openings 
assuming our confidence continues to be supported by an economy that is stable  we plan to continue increasing the rate of store openings  as we did in the fourth quarter of  with the goal of resuming our historical rate of openings of to in the second half of this plan allows us to focus on the three drivers of our business average store size  which ultimately drives our level of profitability  store headcount  and store  or unit  growth 
the last two drive our ability to grow our sales long term 
our balance sheet continues to be very strong and our operations have good cash generating characteristics 
during  we tried to manage it well 
during  we generated  or of net earnings of operating cash flow  the comparable figure was  or of net earnings in our first quarter typically has stronger cash flow characteristics due to the timing of tax payments  this benefit reverses itself in the second  third  and fourth quarters as income tax payments go out in april  june  september  and december 
the remaining amounts of cash flow from operating activities are largely linked to the pure dynamics of a distribution business and its strong correlation to working capital 
as we planned  our capital expenditures for were down from this primarily related to the indianapolis  in distribution expansion and to our new distribution center location near dallas  tx 
most of the expenditures for these two locations occurred in and the first half of as indicated in our annual report  we expected our capital expenditures would drop from approximately  in to  in the actual figure came in at  with the difference being driven by lower capital expenditures for computer software and equipment  real estate  and vehicles 
in  we expect our capital expenditures will drop to approximately  again  this reduction is driven by a significant drop in expenditures for the aforementioned indianapolis and dallas facilities 
this reduction will be partially offset by some added spending for computer equipment and vehicles in and some potential real estate purchases for our manufacturing and distribution operations 
the strong free cash flow in operating cash flow less net capital expenditures allowed us to increase our first dividend payment declared january and paid in march by from 
per share in to 
per share in 
this strong free cash flow also allowed us to increase our second dividend payment declared july and paid in august by from 
per share in to 
per share in 
given the economic environment  we are satisfied with our cash flow for as announced on january   our board of directors declared a dividend of 
per share to be paid in february  this represents a increase over our first dividend in 
table of contents financial overview during   and  the weakness of the global industrial environment negatively impacted our business 
the impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years group reflects stores opened in and earlier and opened greater than five years group reflects stores opened in and earlier 
these two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets 
the stores opened greater than two years group reflects stores opened in and earlier represent a consistent same store view of our business 
the net sales change for each of the groups was as follows store age opened greater than years opened greater than years opened greater than years net sales net sales and percentage change in net sales were as follows net sales percentage change the   and percentage change in net sales reflect a weakening economy since late versus a strengthening economy from summer to late in the north american market 
the decrease in related to the general economic weakness in the global marketplace 
the increase in net sales in and came primarily from unit sales growth in existing stores opened more than two years  growth in our newer product lines  and new store openings 
stores opened in contributed approximately  or to net sales 
stores opened in contributed approximately  or to net sales and approximately  or to net sales 
the rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years  and  as stated earlier  the sales of older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores 
monthly daily sales change our business had daily sales changes compared to the comparable month in the preceding year as follows month january february march april may june july august september october november december note daily sales are defined as the sales for a period divided by the number of business days in a period 

table of contents the growth in generally represents a weakening environment which began in late the final three months of continued in the same variable fashion as the previous nine months but showed consistent improvement from the third quarter daily sales growth rate of 
generally speaking  this improvement in late remained in the first nine months of and weakened in the october to december time frame 
the slow down in the final three months of and all of relate to the general economic weakness in the global marketplace 
note see our discussion by customer type and about sequential trends earlier in this report 
impact of fuel prices rising fuel prices negatively impacted and  however  we did feel some relief in the final months of and the first nine months of during the first  second  third  and fourth quarter of  our total vehicle fuel costs averaged approximately million  million  million  and million per month  respectively 
during the first  second  third  and fourth quarter of  our total vehicle fuel costs averaged approximately million  million  million  and million per month  respectively 
the changes resulted from variations in fuel costs  the freight initiative discussed below  a reduction in sales volume  and the increase in the number of vehicles necessary to support sales personnel and to support additional store locations 
these fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles semi tractors  straight trucks  and sprinter trucks which is recorded in cost of goods and the fuel utilized in our store delivery vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses the split in the last several years has been approximately between distribution and store use 
in  we introduced our new freight model as a means to continue to improve our operating performance 
the freight model represents a focused effort to haul a higher percentage of our products utilizing the fastenal trucking network which operates at a substantial savings to external service providers because of our ability to leverage our existing routes and to charge freight more consistently in our various operating units 
this initiative positively impacted our business over the last several years despite the increases in average per gallon fuel costs during several of those years 
the following table indicates changes in average per gallon fuel costs during   and per gallon average quarter st nd rd th diesel fuel gasoline per gallon average quarter st nd rd th diesel fuel gasoline per gallon percentage change quarter st nd rd th diesel fuel gasoline per gallon average quarter st nd rd th diesel fuel gasoline per gallon percentage change quarter st nd rd th diesel fuel gasoline 
table of contents gross profit margins gross profit as a percent of net sales was as follows gross profit margin percentage decreased from to the gross margin change was driven by different factors during versus historically our gross margins have been driven by several factors a focused effort to challenge our sales force to increase the gross margin on business with a lower than acceptable margin  a focused effort to stay ahead of inflationary increases in product cost which can provide short term inflation margin  improvements in our direct sourcing operations  continued focus on our freight initiative discussed earlier  and continued focus on our product availability within our network 
this product availability focus centers on our master stocking hub in indianapolis  indiana  and our efficient ability to pull product from store to store 
however  in  the inflation margin noted in item reversed from an inflation gain to a deflation loss as higher cost product purchased in  which turned through our system slower than anticipated  was sold against deflationary selling prices in and the competitive marketplace caused the margin on recently purchased product to drop due to added pressure on selling prices 
these two issues continued to worsen during the latter half of  with august being the worst month 
the gross margin in was also impacted by reductions in vendor volume allowances due to the reductions in purchase volumes with our vendors relative to the prior year and due to our decision to purposely forego potential volume rebates in an effort to continue to aggressively manage our inventory levels 
we were disappointed by the decrease in gross margins  however  we believe the reasons noted above are short term in nature and we remain confident in our ability to improve gross margins in gross profit margins for increased over the improvement was driven by the five historical factors noted above 
operating and administrative expenses operating and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were as follows operating and administrative expenses in decreased from the decrease was primarily driven by payroll and related costs  which contracted due to reduced headcount and due to decreased incentive compensation due to our sales and gross margin decline and transportation costs  which contracted due to decreasing fuel costs 
as the economy dramatically weakened in october  we took steps to lower our operating and administrative expense growth in subsequent quarters if our sales growth continued to weaken 
we were pleased with our ability to rein in expenses during the fourth quarter of and all of operating expenses in the fourth quarter of decreased from the fourth quarter of operating and administrative expenses in grew over while this rate of growth was greater than our sales growth of  at that time it represented the slowest rate of growth we have achieved in recent history 
the growth was primarily driven by payroll and related costs  which expanded due to headcount growth and increased incentive due to our gross margin improvement  transportation costs  which expanded due to rising fuel costs  and our legal settlement described earlier in this form k 
as indicated above  the economy dramatically weakened in october  therefore  we took steps to lower our operating and administrative expense growth 
we were pleased with our ability to rein in expenses during the fourth quarter of given the increase in personnel and store locations compared to the fourth quarter of operating expenses in the fourth quarter of grew over the fourth quarter of 
table of contents the operating and administrative expenses for include  of compensation expense related to stock options 
during and  this expense was  and  respectively 
the increase from to was driven by stock option grants in april and the options issued in   and vest over a five to eight year period 
we estimate the three option grants  when combined  will result in compensation expense of approximately per month for the next four years  dropping slightly in the remaining period 
no other stock options were outstanding during these periods 
payroll related costs payroll and related costs represented approximately   and of operating and administrative expenses in   and  respectively 
our net payroll cost for decreased approximately from the disparity between the full time equivalent headcount decline noted below from to and the expense decline is driven by several factors contractions in sales commissions earned  contractions in bonuses earned  reductions of hours worked per employee and of temporary labor  and a reduction of the profit sharing contribution earned 
the decrease was partially offset by the increase in stock option expense noted above and the increase in health care costs noted below 
as we have indicated in the past  our regional leaders  district managers  store managers  and other sales personnel are rewarded for  among other things  growth in sales  gross profit dollars  and pre tax earnings 
the negative growth rates of these amounts during the fourth quarter and the year ended december   when compared to the growth rates in the same periods of  drove the contractions noted in   and above 
our net payroll costs for the fourth quarter of decreased approximately over the fourth quarter of our net payroll cost for increased approximately over our net payroll costs for the fourth quarter of increased approximately over the fourth quarter of the disparity between the full time equivalent headcount growth in the fourth quarter of and the expense growth is driven by contractions in the incentive commissions and bonuses earned during the final quarter of in  payroll and related costs decreased at a rate faster than net sales due to a decrease in our gross margin percentage from to see earlier discussion 
in  payroll and related costs grew faster than net sales due to increased incentive plan payouts resulting primarily from increased gross profit dollars for the year 
in  payroll and related costs increased at a rate which was less than the rate of increase in net sales 
effective management of this expense allows us to leverage the sales growth more effectively 
the following sets forth the average number of employees numbers are presented on a full time equivalent basis for each of   and change from to store personnel distribution and manufacturing personnel administrative and sales support personnel total change 
table of contents the rate of decrease in store personnel in was slower than the rate of change in sales due to a increase in the number of store locations  and our attempt to balance selling activities versus cost controls 
the rate of increase in store personnel in was faster than the sales growth rate due to the additional personnel added as part of our pathway to profit initiative discussed below 
the decrease in distribution and manufacturing and administrative and sales support personnel from the beginning of to the end of was amplified by the weak selling environment in  but generally related to the tight management of headcount growth for these personnel since early when we first introduced our pathway to profit initiative discussed elsewhere in this report 
the two year percentage change noted above was included to emphasize the impact of the pathway to profit initiative on the relative changes between the different types of personnel 
two components of employee related costs did increase from to health care costs and stock option expense 
the health care costs for the fourth quarter of increased from the fourth quarter of and from the third quarter of for the year  health care costs increased 
the increase is due to rising health care costs and the increase in the percentage of employees opting for expanded coverage as their spouses have lost their insurance coverage at other employers due to the current economic environment 
our health benefits program is essentially a self insured plan  and as the claim activity escalated during the year  we were caught by surprise in the final four to five months of the year due to the magnitude of the increase 
with the benefit of hindsight  we underestimated three factors the impact of the shift in the mix of our participants noted above  the impact of the gap between the expenses associated with providing cobra benefits versus the funds received from the participants and or the federal government  and the increase in health care utilization when compared to previous years 
we were pleased with our organization s ability to manage payroll and related costs in   and  while also contributing an annual profit sharing amount of approximately  and  in and  respectively  to our employees k plan accounts or registered retirement savings plan accounts in the case of our canadian employees 
unfortunately  our operating results did not allow for a profit sharing contribution in occupancy costs occupancy costs represented approximately   and of operating expenses in   and  respectively 
occupancy expenses grew approximately from to the annual increase in occupancy was driven by a net increase in the number of store locations  which was partially offset by reductions in rent expense at existing stores  by the relocation of approximately of our stores  and by the depreciation impact of our new or expanded facilities in dallas  texas and indianapolis  indiana 
occupancy expenses grew approximately from to in  we were able to leverage our occupancy costs for the first time since earlier in the decade 
occupancy costs in and increased due to a and net increase in the number of store locations in and  respectively  the upgrade of store locations in connection with the store upgrade initiative formerly referred to as csp  and the relocation of existing stores 
during and  we relocated approximately and of our stores  respectively 
transportation costs transportation costs represented approximately   and of operating expenses in   and  respectively 
net transportation costs decreased from to the decrease was primarily driven by lower gasoline prices and by the stabilization in the sales price of our vehicles for sale 
in  transportation was one component of operating and administrative expenses that experienced meaningful de leverage 
our transportation costs grew approximately from to this increase was primarily driven by the increase in fuel costs discussed earlier and by the increase in the number of vehicles needed to support an expanded sales force 
gain loss on sale of property  plant  and equipment the loss on sale of property and equipment for and came primarily from the sale of used vehicles 
the number was partially offset by the gain on the sale of our dallas  texas distribution center 
income taxes incomes taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  were approximately   and for   and  respectively 
this rate fluctuates over time based on the income tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate  the level of profits in those jurisdictions  and changes in tax law and regulations in those jurisdictions 

table of contents net earnings net earnings  net earnings per share eps  percentage change in net earnings  and the percentage change in eps  were as follows dollar amounts net earnings basic eps diluted eps percentage change net earnings basic eps diluted eps during  the net earnings decrease was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors in our gross margin discussion 
during  the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the previously mentioned improvements in gross profit margins and disciplined management of our occupancy expenses 
during  the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the previously mentioned impact of payroll and related costs and the improvements in gross profit margins 
the eps percentage change rate was better than that of net earnings due to the repurchase of shares in   and working capital two components of working capital  accounts receivable and inventories  are highlighted below 
the annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows dollar change accounts receivable inventories annual percentage change accounts receivable inventories these two assets were impacted by our initiatives to improve working capital 
these initiatives include the establishment of a centralized call center to facilitate accounts receivable management this facility became operational early in and the tight management of all inventory amounts not identified as either expected store inventory  new expanded inventory  inventory necessary for upcoming store openings  or inventory necessary for our master stocking hubs 
the accounts receivable decrease of from december to december was the result of a daily sales decrease of and in november and december  respectively 
the accounts receivable increase of from december  to december  relates to a daily sales increase of and in november and december  respectively 
a portion of our inventory procurement has a longer lead time than our ability to foresee sales trends  therefore  the drop in sales growth activity late in the fourth quarter of and during the first quarter of continued to result in inventory consumption that was less than the amount of inbound product  with the exception of march the inventory decrease noted in march continued through most of our inventory dropped approximately   and  during the first  second  and third quarters of  respectively 
the inventory grew by approximately  in the fourth quarter  approximately half of this increase related to our december acquisition of holo krome discussed later and the balance related to an increase in inventory stocking at our distribution centers to support the improving sales trends we have seen since august 
table of contents as we indicated in earlier communications  our goal is to move the ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory annual sales ar i back to a better than a ratio 
on december  and  we had a ratio of and  respectively 
pathway to profit during april  we disclosed our intention to alter the growth drivers of our business 
for most of the last decade  we used store openings as the primary growth driver of our business our historical rate was approximately new stores each year 
as announced in april  we began to add outside sales personnel into existing stores at a faster rate than historical patterns 
we funded this sales force expansion with the occupancy savings generated by opening stores at the rate of to per year we opened approximately  and new stores in   and  respectively  see also our disclosure above regarding the expected rate of store openings 
at the time it was announced our goal with this strategy was four fold to continue growing our business at a similar rate with the new outside sales investment model  to grow the sales of our average store to thousand per month in the five year period from to  to enhance the profitability of the overall business by capturing the natural expense leverage that has historically occurred in our existing stores as their sales grow  and to improve the performance of our business due to the more efficient use of working capital primarily inventory as our average store size increases 
the economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of and continued into caused us to alter the pathway to profit during these changes center on two aspects temporarily slowing store openings to a range of to see earlier comments  and stopping headcount additions except for store openings and for stores that are growing see earlier comments 
we believe this economic setback will impact the timing of when we achieve the thousand per month average by to months 
however  the current economic weakness only serves to strengthen our belief in the pathway to profit 
since first implementing the pathway to profit  we have increased our store count and our store full time equivalent fte head count 
however  the rate of increase in store locations has slowed and fte headcount for all types of personnel has been reduced since the economy weakened late in the percentage change year over year since the fourth quarter of in the number of stores at quarter end and in the average fte per quarter were as follows december september june march december store count growth store personnel fte distribution and manufacturing personnel fte administrative and sales support personnel fte total fte headcount growth while we have reduced our fte headcount at our store locations  much of this relates to a reduction in part time hours worked as our absolute headcount numbers related to store personnel have remained more stable 
we believe this allows us to manage our expense in the short term while maintaining our ability to sell into the marketplace 
the percentage change year over year since the fourth quarter of in the absolute store personnel headcount at quarter end were as follows december september june march december store personnel absolute headcount change 
table of contents since march  the month before announcing the pathway to profit  and december  our absolute headcount and fte headcount have changed as follows absolute change fte change store personnel distribution and manufacturing personnel administrative and sales support personnel total store size and profitability the store groups listed in the table below  when combined with our strategic account stores  represented approximately to of our sales in the fourth quarter of   and strategic account stores  which numbered   and in the fourth quarter of   and  respectively  are stores that are focused on selling to a group of strategic account customers in a limited geographic market 
our remaining sales approximately to in the fourth quarter of   and relate to either our in plant locations  our direct fastenal cold heading business including our new holo krome business discussed under acquisition below  or our direct import business 
our average store  excluding the business not sold through a store  had sales of   and  per month in the fourth quarter of   and  respectively 
the average age  number of stores  and pre tax margin data by store size for the fourth quarter of   and  respectively  were as follows three months ended december  sales per month average age years number of stores percentage of stores pre tax margin percentage to   to   to   to  over  strategic accounts total three months ended december  sales per month average age years number of stores percentage of stores pre tax margin percentage to   to   to   to  over  strategic accounts total 
table of contents three months ended december  sales per month average age years number of stores percentage of stores pre tax margin percentage to   to   to   to  over  strategic accounts total as we indicated earlier in this report  our goal is to increase the sales of our average store to approximately  per month 
this will shift the store mix emphasis from the first three categories to   to  and  to  to the last three categories  to   to  and over  and we believe will allow us to leverage our fixed cost and increase our overall productivity 
note dollar amounts in this section are presented in whole dollars  not thousands 
acquisition on december   we purchased certain assets of a domestic manufacturer of socket products a type of fastener 
the business has an established name  holo krome  and has a good depth of knowledge and skill in its approximate employees 
we believe this business will be a good addition to serving the needs of our customers 
the business did not have a meaningful impact on our financial results there were some balance sheet impacts of the all cash acquisition  as noted in our cash flow statement 
the acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on our overall sales in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows dollars of net earnings the   and increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the continued improvement in accounts receivable and inventory noted in the working capital discussion above 
the percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution center locations was as follows on december store distribution center total new stores open with the standard store model  which consists of a core stocking level of approximately thousand per location 
this inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows dollars of net earnings property and equipment expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows dollars of net earnings the decrease in investing activities from is primarily due to the decrease in property and equipment expenditures 
this was primarily due to the reduction or elimination in of the cost related to the purchase of adjoining property in indianapolis  indiana and the relocation of our dallas  texas distribution center which occurred in  and the expansion of our indianapolis  indiana master distribution center which occurred in and the first half of this decrease was partially offset by an increase in purchase of short term marketable securities in the increase in investing activities is primarily due to the increase in property and equipment expenditures 
this was primarily due to the expansion of our indianapolis  indiana master distribution center  the purchase of adjoining property in indianapolis  indiana and the relocation of our dallas  texas distribution center noted above 
property and equipment expenditures in  and consist of the purchase of software and hardware for fastenal s information processing systems  the addition of certain pickup trucks  the purchase of signage  shelving  and other fixed assets related to store openings  the addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment  the expansion or improvement of certain owned or leased store properties  the expansion of fastenal s distribution trucking fleet  the cost related to the relocation of our new dallas  texas distribution center and  the cost related to the expansion of our indianapolis  indiana master distribution center and  and the cost of a new manufacturing facility in rockford  illinois 
disposals of property and equipment consist of the planned disposition of certain pick up trucks  semi tractors  and trailers in the normal course of business  the disposition of real estate relating to several store locations and  in the case of  the disposal of our former dallas  texas distribution center 
we expect to incur approximately  in total capital expenditures in  consisting of approximately  for manufacturing  warehouse and packaging equipment and facilities   for shelving and related supplies for our store openings and a la carte store expansions   for data processing equipment   for real estate and improvement to store buildings  and  for vehicles 
we have expanded the number of owned store locations over the last several years and expect to purchase additional locations in the future 
as of december   we had no material outstanding commitments for capital expenditures 
we anticipate funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations  from available cash and cash equivalents  and  if necessary  from our borrowing capacity 
in addition to opening new stores in the united states  we plan to continue opening additional stores in our foreign markets

in some actions  the claimants seek damages that could require significant expenditures 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc contingencies  we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other  the minimum amount of the range is accrued 
if a loss is reasonably possible  but not known or probable  and can be reasonably estimated  the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in most cases  significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded 
although we believe we have adequately provided for probably losses from litigation  the ultimate outcome of litigation could be materially difference from reserves recorded
