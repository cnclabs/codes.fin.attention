item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west s consolidated financial statements and aps financial statements and the related notes that appear in item of this report 
for information on the broad factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate  see forward looking statements at the front of this report and risk factors in item a 
overview pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps 
aps is a vertically integrated electric utility that provides retail and wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona  with the major exceptions of about one half of the phoenix metropolitan area  the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona 
aps accounts for substantially all of our revenues and earnings  and is expected to continue to do so 
areas of business focus operational performance and reliability 
nuclear 
palo verde experienced strong performance during  with its three units achieving a combined year end capacity factor of 
with a focus on safely and efficiently generating electricity for the long term  aps applied for twenty year renewals of its operating licenses for each of the three palo verde units  and is making preparations to secure necessary resources to operate the plant during this extended period of time 
palo verde s accomplishments also included the installation of a new reactor vessel head  upgraded equipment and processes designed to substantially reduce the time required to defuel and refuel the reactor during refueling outages  and the successful implementation of a comprehensive improvement plan  which allowed palo verde unit to exit the nrc s enhanced inspection regime column earlier than anticipated  in march of coal and related environmental matters 
aps coal plants  four corners and cholla  achieved net capacity factors of and  respectively  in aps is focused on developing legislation and increased regulation concerning greenhouse gas emissions  and the potential impacts on our coal fleet 
recent concern over climate change and other emission related issues could have a significant impact on our capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes  emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades for these plants 
aps is closely monitoring our long range capital management plans  understanding that the resulting legislation and regulation could impact the economic viability of certain plants  as well as the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any such equipment upgrades 
see business of arizona public service company environmental matters climate change in item and climate change related risks described in item a for additional climate change developments and risks facing aps 

table of contents transmission and delivery 
in the area of transmission and delivery to its customers  aps also ranked favorably during  with top quartile performance for average customer outage time 
during  aps undertook several significant transmission projects  including the morgan to pinnacle peak transmission line scheduled for completion at the end of  and the completion of two switchyards  one of which will support capacity for renewable energy projects 
aps is working closely with regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs resulting from the current focus on renewable energy 
aps is also working to establish and expand smart grid technology throughout its service territory designed to provide a variety of benefits both to aps and its customers 
this technology should allow customers to better monitor their energy use and needs  minimize system outage durations and the number of customers that experience outages  and facilitate cost savings to aps through improved reliability and the automation of certain distribution functions  including remote meter reading and remote connects and disconnects 
renewable energy 
aps is committed to increasing the amount of energy produced by renewable energy resources  which was a significant focus in aps recent rate case settlement described below 
aps and the other parties to the rate case worked with the acc commissioners to address a wide range of customer needs and to secure a clean  sustainable energy future for arizona 
the acc adopted a renewable energy standard several years ago  recognizing the importance of renewable energy to our state 
in the rate case settlement agreement  aps agreed to exceed these standards  committing that of aps resources will come from renewable energy by the year a variety of other provisions in the settlement agreement reinforce aps dedication to renewable energy through initiatives to build a photovoltaic solar plant  install solar rooftop panels on schools and seek an arizona wind generation project 
during  aps filed its annual res implementation plan that included a request for acc approval of the az sun program 
as proposed in its plan  aps would invest an estimated million to develop at least mw of photovoltaic solar plants 
it currently anticipates that this solar capacity would be placed into service in the to timeframe 
the ultimate timing depends on the outcome of current and future procurement processes 
see note for additional details regarding this program  including the estimated timing of the acc s determination on the matter and the related cost recovery 
aps also issued two requests for proposal rfp for renewable resources in early these rfp s are part of the process for procuring the additional renewable resources required under the rate case settlement 
the first rfp is for utility scale solar photovoltaic projects between and mw 
assuming acc approval of the az sun program as proposed  this rfp will serve as the first procurement step for implementing that program 
the second rfp is for wind projects between and mw to be located within arizona 
rate matters 
aps needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain adequate financial health 
aps retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by the ferc 
at the end of  the acc approved a settlement agreement entered into by aps and twenty one of the twenty three other parties to aps general retail rate case  with modifications that did not materially affect the overall economic terms of the agreement 
the rate case settlement should strengthen aps financial condition by allowing for rate stability and a greater level of cost recovery and return on investment 
it also authorizes and requires equity infusions into aps of at least million prior to the end of the settlement demonstrates cooperation among aps  the acc staff  the residential utility consumer office ruco and other intervenors to the rate case  and establishes a future rate case filing plan that allows aps the opportunity to help shape arizona s energy future outside of continual rate cases 
see note for a detailed discussion of the settlement agreement terms and information on aps ferc rates 
aps has several recovery mechanisms in place that provide more timely recovery to aps of its fuel and transmission costs  and costs associated with the promotion and implementation of its energy efficiency  demand side management and renewable energy efforts and customer programs 
these mechanisms are described more fully in note 
table of contents financial strength and flexibility 
despite the volatility and disruption of the credit markets  pinnacle west and aps currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and have been able to access these facilities  ensuring adequate liquidity for each company 
in early february  aps entered into a million revolving credit facility  replacing its million revolving credit facility that would have otherwise terminated in december at that same time  pinnacle west entered into a million revolving credit facility that replaces its million facility that also would have otherwise terminated in december suncor real estate operations 
as a result of the continuing distressed conditions in the real estate markets  during suncor undertook a program to dispose of its homebuilding operations  master planned communities  land parcels  commercial assets and golf courses in order to eliminate its outstanding debt 
this resulted in impairment charges of approximately million  or million after income taxes  for see pinnacle west consolidated liquidity and capital resources other subsidiaries suncor below for a discussion of suncor s outstanding debt and related matters  note for a further discussion of impairment charges and the suncor related risk factor in item a 
subsidiaries 
our other first tier subsidiaries  el dorado and apses  are not expected to have any material impact on our financial results  or to require any material amounts of capital  over the next three years 
key financial drivers in addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above  many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook  including those listed below 
we closely monitor these factors to plan for the company s current needs  and to adjust our expectations  financial budgets and forecasts appropriately 
electric operating revenues 
for the years through  retail electric revenues comprised approximately of our total electric operating revenues 
our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth  variations in weather from period to period  customer mix  average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs  electricity rates and tariffs  the recovery of psa deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms 
off system sales of excess generation output  purchased power and natural gas are included in regulated electricity segment revenues and related fuel and purchased power because they are credited to aps retail customers through the psa 
these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess economic generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions  including competition  demand and prices 
customer and sales growth 
customer growth in aps service territory for the year ended december  was compared with the prior year 
for the three years through  aps customer growth averaged per year 
we currently expect customer growth to average about per year for through due to economic conditions both nationally and in arizona 
retail sales in kilowatt hours  adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations  for declined compared to the prior year  reflecting the poor economic conditions in and the effects of our energy efficiency programs 
for the three years through  aps actual retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours  adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations  grew at an average annual rate of 
we currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours will remain flat on average per year during through  including the effects of aps energy efficiency programs  but excluding the effects of weather variations 
a continuation of the economic downturn  or the failure of the arizona economy to rebound in the near future  could further impact these estimates 
the customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph apply to native load customers 

table of contents actual sales growth  excluding weather related variations  may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors  such as economic conditions  customer growth  usage patterns  impacts of energy efficiency programs and responses to retail price changes 
our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatt hour sales projection attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to million 
weather 
in forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above  we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data 
historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of million 
however  our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to million 
fuel and purchased power costs 
fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes  existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel  our power plant performance  transmission availability or constraints  prevailing market prices  new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas  our hedging program for managing such costs and psa deferrals and the amortization thereof 
operations and maintenance expenses 
operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth  power plant operations  maintenance of utility plant including generation  transmission  and distribution facilities  inflation  outages  higher trending pension and other postretirement benefit costs  renewable energy and demand side management related expenses which are offset by the same amount of regulated electricity segment operating revenues and other factors 
in its recent retail rate case settlement  aps committed to operational expense reductions from through and received approval to defer certain pension and other postretirement benefit cost increases to be incurred in and depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation  transmission  and distribution facilities  and changes in depreciation and amortization rates 
the capital expenditures section below provides information regarding the planned additions to our facilities 
we have also applied to the nrc for renewed operating licenses for each of the palo verde units 
if the nrc grants the extension  we estimate that our annual pretax depreciation expense will decrease by approximately million at the later of the license extension date or january  property taxes 
taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes  which are affected by the value of property in service and under construction  assessment ratios  and tax rates 
the average property tax rate for aps  which currently owns the majority of our property  was of the assessed value for  of the assessed value for and of the assessed value for we expect property taxes to increase as we add new utility plant including new generation  transmission and distribution facilities described below under capital additions and as we improve our existing facilities 

table of contents income taxes 
income taxes are affected by the amount of pre tax book income  income tax rates  and certain non taxable items  such as the allowance for equity funds used during construction 
in addition  income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities 
interest expense 
interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt see note the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures  long term debt maturities  and internally generated cash flow 
capitalized interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction 
we stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 
pinnacle west consolidated results of operations our results of operations  provided below  are based upon our two reportable business segments our regulated electricity segment  which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily electric service to native load customers and related activities and includes electricity generation  transmission and distribution  and our real estate segment  which consists of suncor s real estate development and investment activities

pinnacle west parent company our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our long term debt 
the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  payout ratio trends  free cash flow and financial market conditions

table of contents other subsidiaries suncor suncor s principal loan facility  the suncor secured revolver  is secured primarily by an interest in land  commercial properties  land contracts and homes under construction 
at december   suncor had borrowings of approximately million under the secured revolver see note 
the revolver matured on january  suncor and the agent bank for the secured revolver are discussing an extension of the maturity date to allow time for suncor to continue discussions concerning the potential sale of additional properties 
in addition to the secured revolver  at december   suncor had approximately million of outstanding debt under other credit facilities million of which has matured since december  and remains outstanding see notes and 
suncor intends to apply the proceeds of planned asset sales see note to the repayment of its outstanding debt 
real estate impairment charges recorded throughout see note resulted in violations of certain covenants contained in the suncor secured revolver and suncor s other credit facilities 
the lenders have taken no enforcement action related to the covenant defaults 
if suncor is unable to obtain an extension or renewal of the secured revolver or its other matured debt  or if it is unable to comply with the mandatory repayment and other provisions of any new or modified credit agreements  suncor could be required to immediately repay its outstanding indebtedness under all of its credit facilities as a result of cross default provisions 
such an immediate repayment obligation would have a material adverse impact on suncor s business and financial position and impair its ongoing viability 
suncor cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its lenders or its ability to sell assets for sufficient proceeds to repay its outstanding debt 
suncor s ability to generate sufficient cash from operations while it pursues lender negotiations and further asset sales is uncertain 
neither pinnacle west nor any of its other subsidiaries has guaranteed any suncor indebtedness 
a suncor debt default would not result in a cross default of any of the debt of pinnacle west or any of its other subsidiaries 
while there can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of this matter  pinnacle west does not believe that suncor s inability to obtain waivers or similar relief from suncor s lenders would have a material adverse impact on pinnacle west s cash flows or liquidity 
as of december   suncor could not transfer any cash dividends to pinnacle west as a result of the covenants mentioned above 
the restriction does not materially affect pinnacle west s ability to meet its ongoing capital requirements 
el dorado el dorado expects minimal capital requirements over the next three years and intends to focus on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments 
apses apses expects minimal capital expenditures over the next three years 
debt provisions pinnacle west s and aps debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include debt to capitalization ratios 
certain of aps bank financing arrangements also include an interest coverage test 
pinnacle west and aps comply with these covenants and each anticipates it will continue to meet these and other significant covenant requirements 
for both pinnacle west and aps  these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 
at december   the ratio was approximately for pinnacle west and for aps 
the provisions regarding interest coverage require minimum cash coverage of two times the interest requirements for aps 
the interest coverage was approximately times under aps bank financing agreements as of december  failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which  generally speaking  would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could cross default other debt 
see further discussion of cross default provisions below 

table of contents neither pinnacle west s nor aps financing agreements contain rating triggers that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade 
however  our bank financial agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest costs we pay are determined by our current credit ratings 
all of pinnacle west s loan agreements contain cross default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements

credit ratings the ratings of securities of pinnacle west and aps as of february  are shown below 
the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies  from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained 
there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time 
the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if  in their respective judgments  circumstances so warrant 
any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west s or aps securities and serve to increase the cost of and limit access to capital 
it may also require substantial additional cash or other collateral requirements related to certain derivative instruments  insurance policies  natural gas transportation  fuel supply  and other energy related contracts

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in  aps entered into agreements with three separate vie lessors in order to sell and lease back interests in palo verde unit the leases are accounted for as operating leases 
we are not the primary beneficiary of the palo verde vies and  accordingly  do not consolidate them see note 
aps is exposed to losses under the palo verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of certain events that aps does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur 
under certain circumstances for example  the nrc issuing specified violation orders with respect to palo verde or the occurrence of specified nuclear events  aps would be required to assume the debt associated with the transactions  make specified payments to the equity participants  and take title to the leased unit interests  which  if appropriate  may be required to be written down in value 
if such an event had occurred as of december   aps would have been required to assume approximately million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately million

table of contents critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties  judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 
regulatory accounting regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators  such as the acc and the ferc  to be reflected in our financial statements 
their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already been collected from customers 
management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction 
this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in the state and is subject to change in the future 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings 
we had million of regulatory assets and million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december  included in the balance of regulatory assets at december  is a regulatory asset of million for pension and other postretirement benefits 
this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings 
if these costs are disallowed by the acc  this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings 
see notes and for more information 
pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position 
the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long term  and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary

see note for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

table of contents derivative accounting derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations 
our evaluation of these rules  as they apply to our contracts  determines whether we use accrual accounting for contracts designated as normal or fair value mark to market accounting 
mark to market accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met 
for cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in common stock equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion is recognized in current earnings 
see market risks commodity price risk below for quantitative analysis 
see fair value measurements below for additional information on valuation 
see note for discussion on accounting policies and note for a further discussion on derivative accounting 
fair value measurements we apply recurring fair value measurements to derivative instruments  nuclear decommissioning trusts  certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we use inputs  or assumptions that market participants would use  to determine fair market value  and the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in the fair value hierarchy 
we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment 
our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within the fair value hierarchy 
actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value 
see note for further fair value measurement discussion  note for discussion on accounting policies and note for a further discussion on derivative accounting 
our nuclear decommissioning trusts invest in fixed income securities and equity securities 
the fair values of these securities are based on observable inputs for identical or similar assets 
see note for further discussion of our nuclear decommissioning trusts 
real estate investment impairments we had real estate investments of million and million of home inventory on our consolidated balance sheets at december  for purposes of evaluating impairment  in accordance with guidance on the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  we classify our real estate assets  such as land under development  land held for future development  and commercial property  as held and used 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of real estate assets considered held and used may not be recoverable  we compare the undiscounted cash flows that we estimate will be generated by each asset to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  we adjust the asset to fair value and recognize an impairment charge 
the adjusted value becomes the new book value carrying amount for held and used assets 
we may have real estate assets classified as held and used with fair values that are lower than their carrying amounts  but are not deemed to be impaired because the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying amounts 

table of contents real estate home inventory is considered to be held for sale for the purposes of evaluating impairment 
home inventories are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
fair value less cost to sell is evaluated each period to determine if it has changed 
losses and gains not to exceed any cumulative loss previously recognized are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount 
we determine fair value for our real estate assets primarily based on the future cash flows that we estimate will be generated by each asset discounted for market risk 
our impairment assessments and fair value determinations require significant judgment regarding key assumptions such as future sales prices  future construction and land development costs  future sales timing  and discount rates 
the assumptions are specific to each project and may vary among projects 
the discount rates we used to determine fair values at december  ranged from to 
due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the estimation process  with regard to impairments  it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates 
if conditions in the broader economy or the real estate markets worsen  or as a result of a change in suncor s strategy  we may be required to record additional impairments 
other accounting matters see note for a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards and new standards to be adopted in the future 
in june  the fasb issued amended guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities 
the model for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of a vie has changed significantly under the new guidance 
previously  variable interest holders had to determine whether they had a controlling financial interest in a vie based on a quantitative analysis of the expected gains and or losses of the entity 
the new guidance requires an enterprise with a variable interest in a vie to perform a qualitative assessment in determining whether it has a controlling financial interest in the entity  and if so  whether it is the primary beneficiary 
furthermore  the amended guidance requires companies to continually evaluate vies for consolidation 
this guidance was effective for us on january  we are continuing to evaluate the impact this new guidance may have on our financial statements 
market and credit risks market risks our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates  commodity prices and investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund 
interest rate and equity risk we have exposure to changing interest rates 
changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variable rate debt and the market value of fixed income securities held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund see note 
the nuclear decommissioning trust fund also has risks associated with the changing market value of its investments 
nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices

our risk management committee  consisting of officers and key management personnel  oversees company wide energy risk management activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management policies 
we manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives  including exchange traded futures and options and over the counter forwards  options and swaps 
as part of our risk management program  we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities
