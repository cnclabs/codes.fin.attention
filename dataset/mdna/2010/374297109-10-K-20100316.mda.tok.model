item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general marketing and the marketing leases 
if marketing fails to pay rent  taxes or insurance premiums when due under the marketing leases and the failure is not cured by marketing within a specified time after receipt of notice  we have the right to terminate the marketing leases and to exercise other customary remedies against marketing 
if marketing fails to comply with any other obligation under the master lease after notice and opportunity to cure  we do not have the right to terminate the master lease 
in the event of marketing s default where we do not have the right to terminate the master lease  our available remedies under the master lease are to seek to obtain an injunction or other equitable relief requiring marketing to comply with its obligations under the master lease and to recover damages from marketing resulting from the failure 
if any lease we have with a third party landlord for properties that we lease to marketing is terminated as a result of our default and the default is not caused by marketing  we have agreed to indemnify marketing for its losses with respect to the termination 
marketing has the right of first refusal to purchase any property leased to marketing under the marketing leases that we decide to sell 
we have also agreed to provide limited environmental indemnification to marketing  capped at million  for certain pre existing conditions at six of the terminals we own and lease to marketing 
under the agreement  marketing is obligated to pay the first million of costs and expenses incurred in connection with remediating any pre existing terminal condition  marketing will share equally with us the next million of those costs and expenses and marketing is obligated to pay all additional costs and expenses over million 
we have accrued million as of december  and in connection with this indemnification agreement 
under the master lease  we continue to have additional ongoing environmental remediation obligations at one hundred eighty seven scheduled sites and our agreements with marketing provide that marketing otherwise remains liable for all environmental matters

item legal proceedings the company is engaged in a number of legal proceedings  many of which we consider to be routine and incidental to our business 
the following is a description of material legal proceedings  including those involving private parties and governmental authorities under federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment 
we are vigorously defending all of the legal proceedings involving the company  including each of the legal proceedings matters listed below 
in april  our subsidiary  leemilt s petroleum inc  was named as a defendant  along with amoco oil co  bp corporation north america  citgo petroleum corporation  exxon mobil corp  sunoco  inc  tosco corporation  valero energy inc  and others  in a complaint seeking class action classification  filed by three individuals  on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated  in the new york supreme court in dutchess county  ny  arising out of alleged contamination of ground water with methyl tertiary butyl ether a fuel derived from methanol  commonly referred to as mtbe 
we served an answer to the complaint in which we denied liability and asserted affirmative defenses 
the plaintiffs have not responded to our answer and there has been no activity in the case since it was commenced 
in september  we were notified by the new jersey department of environmental protection the njdep that we may be responsible for damages to natural resources nrds by reason of a petroleum release at a retail motor fuel property formerly operated by us in egg harbor  nj 
we have remediated the resulting contamination at the property in accordance with a plan approved by the njdep and continue required sampling of monitoring wells that were required to be installed 
in addition  we responded to the notice and  in late  we met with the njdep to determine whether  and to what extent  we may be responsible for nrds regarding this property and other properties formerly supplied by us with gasoline in new jersey 
since our meeting with the njdep we have had no communication with the njdep arising from this matter regarding nrds 
in november  we received a demand from the state of new york for reimbursement of cleanup and removal costs claimed to have been incurred by the new york environmental protection and spill compensation fund regarding contamination it alleges emanated from one of our retail motor fuel properties in we responded to the state s demand and denied responsibility for reimbursement of such costs 
in september  the state of new york commenced an action against us and costa gas station  inc  the ingraham bedell corporation  exxon mobil corporation  shell oil company  shell oil products company  motiva enterprises  llc  and related parties  in new york supreme court in albany county seeking recovery of such costs as well as additional costs and future costs for remediation  and interest and penalties 
discovery in this case is ongoing 
in october  the company received a demand from the state of new york to pay the costs allegedly arising from investigation and remediation of petroleum spills that occurred at a property formerly owned by us and taken by eminent domain by the state of new york in no formal legal action has yet been commenced by the state 
in september  we received a directive and notice of violation from the njdep calling for a remedial investigation and cleanup  to be conducted by us and gary and barbara galliker  individually and trading millstone auto service  auto tech  and other named parties  of petroleum related contamination found at a retail motor fuel property 
we did not own or lease this property  but did supply gas to the operator of this property in and we have responded to the njdep  denying liability  and we have also tendered the matter to marketing for defense and indemnification under the reorganization and distribution agreement between getty petroleum corp 
n k a getty properties corp 
and marketing dated as of february  the spin off agreement 
marketing has denied responsibility for this matter 
in november   the njdep issued an administrative order and notice of civil administrative penalty assessment the order and assessment to the company  marketing and gary and barbara galliker  individually and trading as millstone auto service 
both marketing and the company have filed requests for a hearing to contest the allegations of the order and assessment 
the hearing request is still pending 
for additional information regarding marketing and the marketing leases as defined below  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general marketing and the marketing leases 
in november  an action was commenced by the state of new york in the supreme court  albany county  seeking the recovery of costs incurred in remediating alleged petroleum contamination down gradient of a gasoline station formerly owned by us  and gasoline stations that were allegedly owned or operated by other named defendants  including m a realty  inc  gas land petroleum  inc  and mid valley oil company 
the company has tendered the matter to m a realty inc for defense and indemnification as relates to discharges of petroleum that occurred on or after july of at the site which is the subject of allegations against the company 
this site was leased by the company to m a realty inc in and sold to m a realty inc 
in m a realty inc has demanded that the company defend and indemnify m a realty inc 
for contamination at this site as of the company has answered the complaint denying liability and asserting affirmative defenses and cross claims against co defendants 
discovery is ongoing 
mtbe litigation from october through september  we were named as a defendant in lawsuits brought on behalf of private and public water providers and governmental agencies in connecticut  florida  massachusetts  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  pennsylvania  vermont  virginia  and west virginia 
these cases allege various theories of liability due to contamination of groundwater with mtbe as the basis for claims seeking compensatory and punitive damages 
we have settled one case and have been dismissed from five of the cases initially filed against us 
presently  fifty three of these mtbe cases remain pending against us 
each of these cases name as defendants approximately fifty petroleum refiners  manufacturers  distributors and retailers of mtbe  or gasoline containing mtbe  including irving oil corporation  mobil oil corporation  sunoco  inc  texaco  inc  tosco corporation  unocal corporation  valero energy corporation  marathon oil company  shell oil company  giant yorktown  inc  bp amoco chemical company  inc  atlantic richfield company  coastal oil new england  inc  chevron texaco corporation  amerada hess corp  chevron usa  inc  citgo petroleum corporation  conocophillips company  exxon mobil corporation  getty petroleum marketing  inc  and gulf oil limited partnership 
pursuant to consolidation procedures under federal law  most of the mtbe cases originally filed in various state and federal courts were transferred to the united states district court for the southern district of new york for coordinated multi district litigation proceedings 
we are presently named as a defendant in thirty nine out of more than one hundred cases that have been consolidated in this multi district litigation 
we are also named as a defendant in fourteen related mtbe cases pending in the supreme court of new york  nassau county 
the federal district court initially designated three individual cases as focus cases for discovery and trial purposes 
we were a named as a defendant in two of these three initial focus cases 
the two focus cases in which we were a named defendant  brought on behalf of the suffolk county water authority and united water of new york  had been set for trial in september prior to the scheduled trial date  a majority of the primary defendants entered into global settlement agreements which settled one hundred two cases brought by the same law firm on behalf of various plaintiffs 
although we were not a party to these global settlements  the two focus cases in which we were a named defendant were included in these settlements 
as a result of these multi party settlements  the court vacated the september trial date for the two initial focus cases in which we were a named defendant 
a new trial date for these two focus cases has not yet been rescheduled 
we remain a defendant in a total of twenty seven out of the one hundred two individual cases brought by the same firm and previously settled by other named defendants 
should these two focus cases or any of the other twenty five cases represented by this firm proceed to trial  the court has indicated that trials would be scheduled stating in june the court has designated two additional cases as focus cases for discovery and trial purposes 
these cases were brought on behalf of water authorities of the village of hempstead and the village of west hempstead 
these cases are presently scheduled for trial in june we believe that several defendants have settled these two focus cases as part of a multi case settlement comprising a total of twenty five cases brought by the same law firm a different law firm from that indicated above on behalf of various plaintiffs 
we remain a defendant in the village of hempstead and the village of west hempstead focus cases  which are among twenty five total cases brought by this other law firm 
in addition to the above described cases  there is one other mtbe case in the consolidated multi district litigation that is pending against us 
this case is brought by various governmental agencies of the state of new jersey  including the njdep  and names many refiners  manufacturers  distributors and retailers as defendants 
in december  the court designated this case as a focus case 
this case remains in its preliminary stages 
we have tendered defense and indemnification to marketing and its insurers under the spin off agreement and the master lease 
in  we provided litigation reserves of million relating to a majority of the mtbe cases pending against us 
however  we are still unable to estimate our liability for a minority of the cases pending against us 
further  notwithstanding that we have provided a litigation reserve as to certain of these cases  there remains uncertainty as to the accuracy of the allegations in the mtbe cases as they relate to us  our defenses to the claims  our rights to indemnification or contribution from marketing  and the aggregate possible amount of damages for which we may be held liable 
matters related to our newark  new jersey terminal and the lower passaic river in september  we received a directive the directive issued by the njdep under the new jersey spill compensation and control act 
the directive indicated that we are one of approximately sixty six potentially responsible parties for alleged nrds resulting from the discharges of hazardous substances along the lower passaic river the lower passaic river 
other named recipients of the directive are north pastoria environmental corporation  amerada hess corporation  american modern metals corporation  apollo development and land corporation  ashland inc  at t corporation  atlantic richfield assessment company  bayer corporation  benjamin moore company  bristol myers squibb  chemical land holdings  inc  chevron texaco corporation  diamond alkali company  diamond shamrock chemicals company  diamond shamrock corporation  dilorenzo properties company  dilorenzo properties  lp  drum service of newark  inc  lp dupont de nemours and company  eastman kodak company  elf sanofi  sa  fine organics corporation  franklin burlington plastics  inc  franklin plastics corporation  freedom chemical company  hd acquisition corporation  hexcel corporation  hilton davis chemical company  kearny industrial associates  lp  lucent technologies  inc  marshall clark manufacturing corporation  maxus energy corporation  monsanto company  motor carrier services corporation  nappwood land corporation  noveon hilton davis inc  occidental chemical corporation  occidental electro chemicals corporation  occidental petroleum corporation  oxy diamond alkali corporation  pitt consol chemical company  plastics manufacturing corporation  pmc global inc  propane power corporation  public service electric gas company  public service enterprise group  inc  purdue pharma technologies  inc  rtc properties  inc  s a realty corporation  safety kleen envirosystems company  sanofi sa  sdi divestiture corporation  sherwin williams company  smithkline beecham corporation  spartech corporation  stanley works corporation  sterling winthrop  inc  stwb inc  texaco inc  texaco refining and marketing inc  thomasset colors  inc  tierra solution  incorporated  tierra solutions  inc  and wilson five corporation 
the directive provided  among other things  that the recipients thereof must conduct an assessment of the natural resources that have been injured by the discharges into the lower passaic river and must implement interim compensatory restoration for the injured natural resources 
njdep alleges that our liability arises from alleged discharges originating from our newark  new jersey terminal site 
we responded to the directive by asserting that we were not liable 
there has been no material activity and or communications by njdep with respect to the directive since early after its issuance 
effective in june  the united states environmental protection agency epa entered into an administrative order on consent aoc with thirty one parties some of which are also named in the directive who agreed to fund a portion of the costs for epa to perform a remedial investigation and feasibility study ri fs for the lower passaic river 
the ri fs is intended to address the investigation and evaluation of alternative remedial actions with respect to alleged damages to the lower passaic river 
after being notified by the epa that they considered us to be a potentially responsible party  we reserved our defenses to liability  became a party to an amended aoc  and joined the cooperating parties group cpg  which consists of the parties which had executed the initial aoc and other parties including chevron texaco 
pursuant to the amended aoc and subsequent amendments adding additional parties  the cpg has agreed to take over performance of the ri fs from epa 
the ri fs does not resolve liability issues for remedial work or restoration of  or compensation for  natural resource damages to the lower passaic river  which are not known at this time 
as to such matters  separate proceedings or activities are currently ongoing 
in a related action  in december  the state of new jersey brought suit in the superior court of new jersey  law division  against certain parties to the directive  occidental chemical corporation  tierra solutions  inc  maxus energy corporation and related entities which the state alleges are responsible for pollution of the passaic river from a former diamond alkali manufacturing plant and seeking recovery of alleged damages incurred and to be incurred on account of alleged discharges of hazardous substances to the passaic river 
in february  certain of these defendants filed third party complaints against approximately three hundred additional parties  including us as well as the other members of the cpg  seeking contribution for a pro rata share of response costs  cleanup and removal costs  and other damages 
the company has answered the complaint  denying responsibility for any discharges of hazardous substances released into the lower passaic river 
on december   the court entered an order under which a special master is tasked with facilitating discussions for the purpose of designing an alternative dispute resolution process for achieving a global resolution of the action 
the special master and certain party representatives are in the process of developing a potential framework for such an alternative dispute resolution process 
we have made a demand upon chevron texaco for indemnity under certain agreements between the company and chevron texaco that allocate environmental liabilities for the newark terminal site between the parties 
in response  chevron texaco has asserted that the proceedings and claims are still not yet developed enough to determine the extent to which indemnities apply 
the company and chevron texaco are engaged in discussions regarding the company s demands for indemnification  and  to facilitate said discussions  in october  entered into a tolling standstill agreement which tolls all claims by and among the company and chevron texaco that relate to the various lower passaic river matters from may   until either party terminates such tolling standstill agreement 
our ultimate liability  if any  in the pending and possible future proceedings pertaining to the lower passaic river is uncertain and subject to numerous contingencies which cannot be predicted and the outcome of which are not yet known

d the years ended and include income tax benefits recognized due to the elimination of  or reduction in  amounts accrued for uncertain tax positions related to being taxed as a c corp 
prior to our election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit under the federal income tax laws in income taxes have not had a significant impact on our earnings since we first elected to be treated as a reit 
e in addition to measurements defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  our management also focuses on funds from operations ffo and adjusted funds from operations affo to measure our performance 
ffo is generally considered to be an appropriate supplemental non gaap measure of the performance of real estate investment trusts reits 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts as net earnings before depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  gains or losses on dispositions of real estate  including such non ffo items reported in discontinued operations  extraordinary items  and cumulative effect of accounting change 
other reits may use definitions of ffo and or affo that are different than ours and  accordingly  may not be comparable 
we believe that ffo and affo are helpful to investors in measuring our performance because both ffo and affo exclude various items included in gaap net earnings that do not relate to  or are not indicative of  our fundamental operating performance 
ffo excludes various items such as gains or losses from property dispositions and depreciation and amortization of real estate assets 
in our case  however  gaap net earnings and ffo typically include the impact of deferred rental revenue straight line rental revenue  the net amortization of above market and below market leases and income recognized from direct financing leases on its recognition of revenue from rental properties collectively the revenue recognition adjustments  as offset by the impact of related collection reserves 
gaap net earnings and ffo from time to time may also include impairment charges and or income tax benefits 
deferred rental revenue results primarily from fixed rental increases scheduled under certain leases with our tenants 
in accordance with gaap  the aggregate minimum rent due over the current term of these leases are recognized on a straight line or an average basis rather than when the payment is contractually due 
the present value of the difference between the fair market rent and the contractual rent for in place leases at the time properties are acquired is amortized into revenue from rental properties over the remaining lives of the in place leases 
income from direct financing leases is recognized over the lease term using the effective interest method which produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the leased property 
impairment of long lived assets represents charges taken to write down real estate assets to fair value estimated when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable 
in prior periods  income tax benefits have been recognized due to the elimination of  or a net reduction in  amounts accrued for uncertain tax positions related be being taxed as a c corp  rather than as a reit  prior to see note d above 
management pays particular attention to affo  a supplemental non gaap performance measure that we define as ffo less revenue recognition adjustments  impairment charges and income tax benefit 
in management s view  affo provides a more accurate depiction than ffo of our fundamental operating performance related to i the impact of scheduled rent increases from operating leases  ii the rental revenue from acquired in place leases  iii the impact of rent due from direct financing leases  iv our rental operating expenses exclusive of impairment charges  and v our election to be treated as a reit under the federal income tax laws beginning in neither ffo nor affo represent cash generated from operating activities calculated in accordance with gaap and therefore these measures should not be considered an alternative for gaap net earnings or as a measure of liquidity
