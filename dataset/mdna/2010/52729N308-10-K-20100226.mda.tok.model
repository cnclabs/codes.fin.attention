such statements reflect the current views of the company with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those described in this document 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
level communications  inc  through its operating subsidiaries  is primarily engaged in the communications business  with additional operations in coal mining 
communications business the company is a facilities based provider of a broad range of communications services 
revenue for communications services is recognized on a monthly basis as these services are provided 
for contracts involving private line  wavelengths and dark fiber services  level may receive up front payments for services to be delivered for a period of generally up to years 
in these situations  level defers the revenue and amortizes it on a straight line basis to earnings over the term of the contract 
at december   for contracts where up front payments were received for services to be delivered in the future  the company s weighted average remaining contract period was approximately years 
communications revenue consists of core communications services  which includes core network services and wholesale voice services core network services includes revenue from transport  infrastructure  data and local and enterprise voice communication services 
wholesale voice services includes revenue from long distance voice services  including domestic voice termination  international voice termination and toll free services 
other communications services includes revenue from managed modem and its related reciprocal compensation services and sbc contract services  which includes revenue from the sbc master services agreement  which was obtained in the acquisition of wiltel 
the two categories of communications revenue are in different phases of the service life cycle  requiring different levels of investment and focus  and providing different contributions to the company s communications adjusted ebitda 
management of level believes that growth in revenue from its core communications services is critical to the long term success of its communications business 
the company also believes it must continue to effectively manage the positive cash flows from its other communications services 
core communications services includes revenue from core network services and wholesale voice services 
core network services revenue represents higher margin services and wholesale voice services represents lower margin services 
the company believes that trends in its communications business are best gauged by looking at revenue trends in core network services 
the company manages wholesale voice services performance based on gross margin contribution rather than revenue growth 
core network services includes revenue from 
table of contents transport  infrastructure  data and local and enterprise voice communication services 
wholesale voice services includes revenue from long distance voice services  including domestic voice termination  international voice termination and toll free services 
other communications services includes revenue from managed modem and its related reciprocal compensation services and sbc contract services  which includes revenue from the sbc master services agreement  which was obtained in the december acquisition of wiltel 
core communications services the company s transport and infrastructure services include metropolitan and intercity wavelengths  private line  ethernet private line  dark fiber  colocation services  professional services and transoceanic services 
growth in transport and infrastructure revenue is largely dependent on increased demand for bandwidth services and available capital of companies requiring communications capacity for their own use or in providing capacity as a service provider to their customers 
these expenditures may be in the form of monthly payments or up front payments for private line  wavelength or dark fiber services 
the company is focused on providing end to end transport services to its customers to directly connect customer locations with a private network 
pricing for end to end services has been stable 
for metropolitan transport services  prices have been relatively stable 
for intercity transport services  the company continues to experience pricing pressure for point to point locations  particularly in locations where a large number of carriers co locate their facilities 
an increase in demand may be partially offset by declines in unit pricing 
data services primarily include the company s high speed internet access service  dedicated internet access dia service  atm and frame relay services  ip and ethernet virtual private network vpn services  content delivery network cdn services  and vyvx broadcast services 
level s internet access service is a high quality and high speed internet access service offered in a variety of capacities 
the company s vpn services permit businesses of any size to replace multiple networks with a single  cost effective solution that greatly simplifies the converged transmission of voice  video  and data 
this convergence to a single platform can be obtained without sacrificing the quality of service or security levels of traditional atm and frame relay offerings 
vpn services also permit customers to prioritize network application traffic so that high priority applications  such as voice and video  are not compromised in performance by the flow of low priority applications such as email 
the company believes that one of the largest sources of future incremental demand for the company s core communications services will be from customers that are seeking to distribute their feature rich content or video over the internet 
revenue growth in this area is dependent on the continued increase in usage by both enterprises and consumers and the pricing environment 
an increase in the reliability and security of information transmitted over the internet and declines in the cost to transmit data have resulted in increased utilization of e commerce or web based services by businesses 
although the pricing for data services is currently stable  the ip market is generally characterized by price compression and high unit growth rates depending upon the type of service 
the company continued to experience price compression in the high speed ip market in and expects that pricing for its high speed ip services will continue to decline in the company  through its level vyvx business  provides transport services for the audio and video programming of its customers over the company s fiber optic network and via satellite 
it uses the company s fiber optic network to carry live traditional broadcast and cable television events from the site of the event to the network control centers of the broadcasters of the event 
for live events where the location is not known in advance  such as breaking news stories in remote locations  the company provides an integrated satellite and fiber optic network based service to transmit the content to its customers 
most of level vyvx s customers for these services contract for 
table of contents the service on an event by event basis  however  there are some customers who have purchased a dedicated point to point service which enables these customers to transmit programming at any time 
on june   level completed the sale of its vyvx advertising distribution business to dg fastchannel  inc and received gross proceeds at closing of approximately million in cash 
level has retained ownership of vyvx s core broadcast business  including the vyvx services broadcast business content distribution capabilities 
the financial results of the vyvx advertising distribution business are included in the company s consolidated results of operations through the date of sale on june  level recognized a gain on the sale of the vyvx advertising distribution business of million in the gain is presented in the consolidated statements of operations as gain on sale of business groups  net 
the company has developed content distribution services through the acquisition of the content delivery network services business cdn business of savvis  which it purchased in january  and the acquisition of dublin  ireland based servecast ltd 
in july the company believes that the addition of the cdn business with its strong  broad portfolio of patents will help the company secure its commercial efforts in the heavily patented cdn market  in which a number of competitors have significant  patented intellectual property 
level believes that one of the largest sources of future incremental demand for communications services will be derived from customers that are seeking to distribute their feature rich content or video over the internet 
the company s core network services includes local and enterprise voice services 
local voice services are primarily components that enable other service providers to deliver business or consumer ready voice products to their end customers 
enterprise voice services are business grade voice services that the company sells directly to its business customers 
the company offers wholesale voice services that target large and existing markets 
the revenue potential for wholesale voice services is large  however  the pricing and margins are expected to continue to decline over time as a result of the new low cost ip and optical based technologies 
in addition  the market for wholesale voice services is being targeted by many competitors  several of which are larger and have more financial resources than the company 
core communications services market groups in order to serve the changing needs of customers in growing markets and to drive growth across the communications organization  sales efforts for core communications services are also disaggregated into four customer facing market groups as follows the wholesale markets group targets customers that include the largest national and global service providers  including carriers  cable companies  wireless companies  voice service providers  systems integrators and the federal government 
these customers typically integrate level services into their own products and services to offer to their end user customers 
the business markets group targets enterprise customers and regional carriers who value a local  professional sales force 
specific customer markets include medium and large businesses  local and regional carriers  state and local government entities  and higher education institutions and consortia 
the content markets group targets media and content companies with large and growing bandwidth needs 
customers in this market include video distribution companies  providers of gaming  mega portals  software service providers  social networking providers  as well as more traditional media distribution companies such as broadcasters  satellite companies  television networks and sports leagues 

table of contents the european markets group targets large european consumers of bandwidth  including the largest european and international carriers  large system integrators  voice service providers  cable operators  internet service providers  content providers  and government and education sectors 
the company believes that the alignment of core communications services around customer markets allowed it to drive growth while enabling it to better focus on the needs of its customers 
each of these groups is supported by dedicated employees in sales and marketing 
each of these groups is also supported by non dedicated  centralized service or product management and development  corporate marketing  global network services  engineering  information technology  and corporate functions including legal  finance  strategy and human resources 
core communications services revenue from customers targeted by each customer facing market group was as follows year ended december  dollars in millions wholesale markets group business markets group content markets group european markets group total core communications services the classification of customers within each customer facing market group can change based upon sales team assignments  merger and acquisition activity by customers and other factors 
there were no material re classification changes in revenue by market group during the three years ended december  beginning in the first quarter of  level has announced that it will modify its revenue disclosure 
instead of using the customer facing market groups  level will discuss its core network services revenue in terms of wholesale  large enterprise and federal  mid market  and european customers 
wholesale will include revenue from international and domestic carriers  cable companies  wireless companies  voice service providers and the vast majority of former content market group customers 
large enterprise and federal will include fortune and other large enterprises that purchase communications services in a manner similar to carriers  including financial services  healthcare and systems integrators  federal government agencies and academic consortia  plus certain large former content markets group customers 
mid market will include medium enterprises generally outside the fortune  regional service providers  certain academic institutions and some state and local governments 
european is unchanged from the presentation 
the european revenue includes the largest european consumers of bandwidth  including the largest european and international carriers  large system integrators  voice service providers  cable operators  internet service providers  content providers  and government and education sectors 
other communications services the company s other communications services are mature services that are not critical areas of emphasis for the company 
other communications services includes revenue from managed modem 
table of contents and its related reciprocal compensation services and sbc contract services  which includes revenue derived under the sbc master services agreement that was obtained in the wiltel acquisition 
the company and its customers continue to see consumers migrate from narrow band dial up services to higher speed broadband services as the narrow band market matures 
the company expects ongoing declines in other communications revenue similar to what has been experienced over the past several years 
the company receives compensation from other carriers when it terminates traffic originating on those carriers networks 
this reciprocal compensation is based on interconnection agreements with the respective carriers or rates mandated by the fcc 
the company has interconnection agreements in place for the majority of traffic subject to reciprocal compensation 
in addition  a majority of the company s existing reciprocal compensation revenue is associated with agreements that are in effect through or beyond 
the company continues to negotiate new interconnection agreements or amendments to its existing interconnection agreements with local carriers as needed 
the company earns the majority of its reciprocal compensation revenue from providing managed modem services  which are declining 
the company also receives reciprocal compensation from its voice services  which is reported within core network services revenue 
communications business strategy and objectives the company s management continues to review all existing lines of business and service offerings to determine how those lines of business and service offerings enhance the company s focus on delivery of communications services and meet its financial objectives 
to the extent that certain lines of business  business groups or service offerings are not considered to be compatible with the delivery of the company s services or meet its financial objectives  level may exit those lines of business or stop offering those services 
the company is focusing its attention on the following operational and financial objectives increasing sales improving the customer experience to increase customer retention and reducing customer churn  growing core network services revenue  achieving sustainable generation of positive cash flows from operations in excess of capital expenditures  reducing network costs and operating expenses  continuing to show improvements in adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue  continuing to implement its go local metro network strategy  including leveraging its existing network assets to expand its addressable market  localizing certain decision making and interaction with its mid market enterprise customers  completing the integration of acquired businesses  managing wholesale voice services revenue for margin contribution  growing its content delivery network services  and refinancing its future debt maturities 
the company s management believes the introduction of new services or technologies  as well as the further development of existing technologies  may reduce the cost or increase the supply of certain services similar to those provided by level the ability of the company to anticipate  adapt and invest in these technology changes in a timely manner may affect the company s future success 

table of contents the company strategically expanded its presence in metropolitan markets and expanded its offering of services to enterprise customers through its business markets group 
this strategy allowed the company to terminate traffic over its owned facilities rather than paying third parties to terminate the traffic 
the expansion into new metro markets also provided additional opportunities to sell services to bandwidth intensive businesses on the company s national and international networks 
in order to expedite the expansion of its metro business  level acquired progress telecom  icg communications  telcove and looking glass in and broadwing in the first quarter of level also strategically expanded its content delivery network services with the acquisitions of the cdn business in the first quarter of and servecast in the third quarter of level will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and could make additional acquisitions in the future 
the successful integration of acquired businesses into level is important to the success of level the company must continue to identify synergies and integrate acquired networks and support organizations  while maintaining the service quality levels expected by customers to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions 
successful integration of these acquired businesses continues to depend on the company s ability to manage these operations  realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by strengthened service offerings and expanded geographic market coverage  and to eliminate redundant and excess costs to fully realize the expected synergies 
if the company is not able to efficiently and effectively continue to integrate the acquired businesses or operations  the company may experience material negative consequences to its business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company has taken steps to improve its existing processes and systems to reduce service activation times and improve its service management 
the company continues to realize improvements in its service management and believes it has implemented sufficient improvements in service activation capabilities to match installation capacity to customer demand for services 
the company has ongoing process and system development work that is being implemented as part of the integration efforts that have and are expected to further improve the full spectrum of the customer experience  including service activation  service management and customer billing as well as various operational efficiency improvements 
the company completed the foundation of its processes and systems development objectives in and remains focused on auditing and migrating network inventory data from legacy applications to its central applications 
recent changes in the economic environment and uncertainty in the global financial markets have required the company to continue to manage its cost structure and operating expenses carefully and to concentrate its capital expenditures on those technologies and assets that enable the company to further develop its core communications services and replace the decline in revenue and earnings from other communications services 
in addition  the company s operating results and financial condition could be negatively affected  if as a result of economic conditions customers defer or forgo purchases of services  customers are unable to make timely payments  the demand for  and prices of  the company s services are reduced as a result of actions by its competitors or otherwise  key suppliers upon which the company relies are unable to provide the materials needed for its network on a timely basis  or the company s financial counterparties  insurance providers or other contractual counterparties are unable to  or do not meet  their contractual commitments 

table of contents for example  the company s revenue and operating results were negatively affected in and as a result of the recent macroeconomic environment 
in addition to the operational objectives mentioned above  the company has also been focused on improving its liquidity  financial condition  and extending the maturity dates of certain debt 
in the fourth quarter of  level communications  inc issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due  series b  for net proceeds of million 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the company repurchased approximately million aggregate principal amount primarily consisting of convertible notes maturing in  and in the third quarter of  million of outstanding aggregate principal of the company s convertible subordinated notes due matured and was repaid 
in addition  during the third quarter of  the company repurchased approximately million aggregate principal amount of various issues of its convertible debt 
the third quarter debt repurchases consisted of million in maturities and million in maturities 
during the second quarter of  level financing  inc level financing  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  amended and restated its existing senior secured credit facility to increase the borrowings through the creation of a million tranche b term loan that matures on march  with a current interest rate of libor plus per annum  with libor set at a minimum of

during the second quarter of  the company repurchased approximately million aggregate principal amount of various issues of its convertible debt 
the second quarter debt repurchases consisted of million in maturities  million in maturities  million in maturities and million in maturities 
in addition  during the second quarter of  the company redeemed at par million aggregate principal amount in maturities 
the company will continue to look for opportunities to improve its financial position and focus its resources on growing revenue and managing costs for the communications business 
coal mining level  through its two consolidated owned joint venture surface mines  one each in montana and wyoming  sells coal primarily through long term contracts with public utilities 
the long term contracts for the delivery of coal establish the price  volume  and quality requirements of the coal to be delivered 
revenue under these and other contracts is generally recognized when coal is shipped to the customer 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses and related disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the 
table of contents circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while the company has other accounting policies that involve estimates such as the allowance for doubtful accounts  accruals for estimated tax and legal liabilities  cost of revenue valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  and unfavorable contracts recognized in purchase accounting  management has identified the policies below  which require the most significant judgments and estimates to be made in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
revenue revenue for communications services  including transport  infrastructure  data  voice and managed modem  is recognized monthly as the services are provided 
communications services are provided either on a usage basis  which can vary period to period  or at a contractually committed amount 
reciprocal compensation revenue is recognized when an interconnection agreement is in place with another carrier  or if an agreement has expired  when the parties have agreed to continue operating under the previous agreement until a new agreement is negotiated and executed  or at rates mandated by the fcc 
periodically  the company will receive payment for reciprocal compensation services in excess of fcc rates and before an agreement is in place 
these amounts are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets until a final agreement has been reached and the necessary regulatory approvals have been received at which time the reciprocal compensation revenue is recognized 
these amounts were insignificant to the company in  and revenue attributable to leases of dark fiber pursuant to indefeasible rights of use agreements irus that qualified for sales type lease accounting and were entered into prior to june   were recognized at the time of delivery and acceptance of the fiber by the customer 
certain sale and long term iru agreements of dark fiber and capacity entered into after june   are required to be accounted for in the same manner as sales of real estate with property improvements or integral equipment 
this accounting treatment results in the deferral of revenue for the cash that has been received and the recognition of revenue ratably over the term of the agreement generally up to years 
termination revenue is recognized when a customer disconnects service prior to the end of the contract period and for which level had previously received consideration and for which revenue recognition was deferred 
termination revenue is also recognized when customers make termination penalty payments to level to settle contractually committed purchase amounts that the customer no longer expects to meet or when a customer and level renegotiate a contract under which level is no longer obligated to provide product or services for consideration previously received and for which revenue recognition has been deferred 
termination revenue is reported in the same manner as the original product or service provided 
accounting practice and guidance with respect to the accounting treatment of revenue continues to evolve 
any changes in the accounting treatment could affect the manner in which the company accounts for revenue within its communications and coal businesses 
revenue reserves the company establishes appropriate revenue reserves at the time services are rendered based on an analysis of historical credit activity to address  where significant  situations in which collection is not reasonably assured as a result of credit risk  potential billing disputes or other reasons 
the company s significant estimates are based on assumptions and other considerations  including payment history  credit ratings  customer financial performance  history of billing disputes  industry financial performance and aging analysis 

table of contents cost of revenue disputes for communications services the company disputes incorrect billings from its suppliers of network services 
the most prevalent types of disputes include disputes for circuits that are not disconnected by its supplier on a timely basis and usage bills with incorrect or inadequate information 
depending on the type and complexity of the issues involved  it may and often does take several quarters to resolve the disputes 
the company establishes appropriate cost of revenue reserves for disputed supplier billings based on an analysis of its historical experience in resolving disputes with its suppliers 
non cash compensation the company recognizes stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards in accordance with fair value recognition provisions 
under the fair value recognition provisions  the company recognizes stock based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate  recognizing compensation cost for only those awards expected to vest over the requisite service period of the awards 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the company estimates the stock price volatility using a combination of historical and implied volatility as level believes it is consistent with the approach most marketplace participants would consider using all available information to estimate expected volatility 
the company has determined that expected volatility is more reflective of market conditions and provides a more accurate indication of volatility than using solely historical volatility 
in reaching this conclusion  the company has considered many factors including the extent to which its future expectations of volatility over the respective term is likely to differ from historical measures  the absence of actively traded options and the company s ability to review volatility of its publicly traded convertible debt with similar terms and prices to the options the company is valuing 
the company issues outperform stock options in which the value received is based on a formula involving a multiplier related to the level by which the company s common stock outperforms the s p index 
the company utilizes a modified black scholes model due to the additional variables required to calculate the effect of the success multiplier for its outperform stock options  including estimating the expected volatility of the s p index 
as a result of the company s stock price performance  the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding outperform stock options was million as of december  the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and the company uses different assumptions  stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if actual forfeiture rates are materially different from the company s estimate  stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the company has recorded in the current period 
valuation of long lived assets the company performs an assessment of its long lived assets  including finite lived acquisition related intangible assets  for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets or asset groupings may not be recoverable 
this review requires the identification of the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of grouping assets subject to review 
the estimate of undiscounted cash flows includes long term forecasts of revenue growth  gross margins and operating expenses 
all of these items require significant judgment and assumptions 
the impairment analysis of long lived assets also requires the company to make certain subjective assumptions and estimates regarding the expected future use of certain additional conduits and the expected future use of certain empty conduits 
an impairment loss may exist when the estimated 
table of contents undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying amount 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the long lived asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value  based on management s assumptions and projections 
the company conducted a long lived asset impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of and concluded that its long lived assets  including finite lived acquisition related intangible assets  were not impaired 
to the extent that future changes in assumptions and estimates cause a change in estimates of future cash flows that indicate the carrying amount of the company s long lived assets  including finite lived acquisition related intangible assets  may not be recoverable  the company may incur impairment charges in the future to write down the carrying amount of the company s long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
useful lives of long lived assets the company performs periodic internal reviews to determine depreciable lives of its property  plant and equipment 
due to rapid changes in technology and the competitive environment  selecting the estimated economic life of telecommunications property  plant  and equipment requires a significant amount of judgment 
the company s internal reviews take into account input from the company s global network services personnel regarding actual usage  physical wear and tear  replacement history  and assumptions regarding the benefits and costs of implementing new technology that factor in the need to meet the company s financial objectives 
valuation of goodwill and acquired indefinite lived intangible assets the company performs an assessment of its goodwill for impairment annually at the end of the fourth quarter  or more frequently if the company determines that indicators of impairment exist 
the company s impairment review process compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the company s reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill assigned to the communications reportable segment totaled billion at both december  and there was no goodwill assigned to the coal mining reportable segment at december  or if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step must be performed  and the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill must be determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
the company considers the use of multiple valuation techniques in accordance with the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance to estimate the fair value of its reporting units and has consistently applied a market approach as the primary valuation technique as part of its impairment assessment process 
during  the company had also utilized the income approach discounted cash flows as a secondary measurement of fair value  as the company believed the use of another valuation technique should be considered given the circumstances resulting from the difficult economic environment and extreme volatility in the financial markets during the use of the income approach as an additional valuation technique in resulted in a measurement that management believes was equally representative of the fair value of the reporting units obtained using the primary value derived with the market approach 
under the market approach  the company estimates the fair value using an in exchange valuation premise based upon the market capitalization of level using quoted market prices  adds an estimated control premium  and then assigns that fair market value to the reporting units 
the most significant estimates and assumptions utilized in its valuations with the market approach involved estimating an 
table of contents appropriate control premium and allocating the estimated enterprise fair value to each of its reporting units 
the company concluded that using as a control premium would be reasonable in its market approach valuation for purposes of performing its goodwill impairment test based on historical control premiums offered for comparable transactions in the communications industry  the availability of financing  and number of potential buyers 
level allocated the calculated market value using the company s quoted market price valuation to each of its two reporting units based on their relative percentage of adjusted ebitda  as this is a key external and internal valuation metric 
based on the results of the company s market approach valuation  the estimated fair value of the communications reporting unit was well above its carrying value at the date of level s impairment test 
under the income approach  the company calculated the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows which was then compared to the carrying value of invested capital for the communications reporting unit 
the most significant estimates and assumptions utilized in the company s discounted cash flow valuation involved estimating unlevered cash flows  discount rates  period of cash flows and determination of terminal value 
the cash flow forecasts used in the company s discounted cash flow analyses were based upon upside  midpoint and downside scenarios and considered the effects of the continued weakening of the economy in the company utilized a discount rate commensurate with its estimated weighted average cost of capital based on level s target capitalization structure 
the company estimated its cost of debt primarily based on quoted market prices of its publicly traded debt and its cost of equity using historical equity beta  risk free rate of return and a market risk premium 
the company s discount rate increased significantly primarily as a result of pricing in the debt markets in level believed the discount rate utilized in its discounted cash flow analysis to be representative of a market participant rate 
the company calculated the terminal value assuming a constant growth rate based on historical growth rates used in recent valuations of companies acquired by level the present value of level s discounted cash flows was well above the communications reporting unit carrying value of invested capital  which represents the carrying value of the reporting unit plus the carrying value of debt  as the company s discounted cash flow analysis was performed using unlevered cash flows 
as indicated above  the company has considered the use of multiple valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of its reporting units as part of level s impairment assessment process and had utilized the income approach discounted cash flows as a secondary measurement of fair value given the circumstances resulting from the difficult economic environment and extreme volatility in the financial markets during the company conducted its goodwill impairment analysis at the end of the fourth quarter of and concluded that its goodwill was not impaired 
the company also performs an assessment of its indefinite lived acquisition related intangible assets annually at the end of the fourth quarter  or more frequently if the company determines that indicators of impairment exist 
the company s impairment review process compares the fair value of the indefinite lived acquisition related intangible assets to their respective carrying values 
if the fair value of the indefinite lived acquisition related intangible assets exceeds their carrying values  then the indefinite lived acquisition related intangible assets are not impaired 
the company s fair value methodology primarily consists of a discounted cash flow analysis that includes estimates of revenue  costs  growth rates and an appropriate discount rate and market 
table of contents comparable estimates 
these estimates are based on historical data  various internal estimates and management s expectations of future trends 
the company conducted its indefinite lived acquisition related intangible asset impairment analyses at the end of the fourth quarter of and concluded that there was no impairment 
to the extent that future changes in the company s assumptions and estimates cause a change in the related fair value estimates that indicate the carrying amount of the company s goodwill and indefinite lived acquisition related intangible assets may not be recoverable  the company may incur impairment charges in the future to write down the carrying amount of the company s goodwill and indefinite lived acquisition related intangible assets to their estimated fair value 
derivative financial instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rate movements 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to decrease the volatility of its earnings and cash flows affected by changes in the underlying rates 
the company has designated its interest rate swap agreements as a cash flow hedge 
in a cash flow hedge  a borrower of variable interest debt agrees with another party to make fixed payments equivalent to paying fixed rate interest on debt in exchange for receiving payments from the other party equivalent to receiving variable rate interest on debt  the effect of which is to eliminate some portion of variability in the borrower s overall cash flows 
the company has designated these derivatives as a cash flow hedge on the date on which level entered into the derivative instrument 
the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are reflected in other comprehensive income loss due to the fact that the interest rate swap agreements are designated as an effective cash flow hedge 
the company then reclassifies these amounts into earnings as the underlying hedged item affects earnings 
in addition  if there are any changes in the fair value of the derivative arising from ineffectiveness of the cash flow hedging relationship  the company recognizes those amounts immediately in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company evaluates quarterly whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item or whether its initial assumption of no ineffectiveness is still valid 
if the company determines that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge  a derivative has ceased to be a highly effective hedge or its assumption of no ineffectiveness is no longer valid  then the company discontinues hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively 
the company also has equity conversion rights associated with debt instruments  which are considered derivative instruments as of december  and the derivative instruments had to be classified as a liability during and the change in fair value of any derivatives that are not designated as hedges are immediately recorded in earnings 
gains from these derivative instruments were million in  and zero in and the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
the company is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non performance by counterparties 
the counterparties to any of the financial derivatives the company enters into are major institutions with investment grade credit ratings 
the company evaluates counterparty credit risk before entering into any hedge transaction  and continues to closely monitor the financial market and the risk that it s counterparties will default on their obligations 
this credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains  if any  in such contracts  should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted 
asset retirement obligations the company s asset retirement obligations consist of legal requirements to remove certain of its network infrastructure at the expiration of the underlying right of way row term  restoration requirements for leased facilities and reclamation requirements in the coal mining business to 
table of contents remediate previously mined properties 
the initial and subsequent measurement of the company s asset retirement obligations require the company to make significant estimates regarding the eventual costs and probability or likelihood that the company will be required to remove certain of its network infrastructure  restore certain of its leased properties and remediate certain of its previously mined properties 
in addition  the company must estimate the periods over which these costs will be incurred and present value the total of such costs using the company s estimate of its credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
the company periodically evaluates its asset retirement obligations to determine if the amount and timing of its cash flow estimates continue to be appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
as a result of indicators suggesting that the estimated cash flows underlying the company s row asset retirement obligations were too high  the company revised its assessment during the fourth quarter of network infrastructure relocations indicated that the company is not being required to physically remove its underground network infrastructure at rates consistent with the company s previous estimates 
other internal and external information corroborated these lower rates 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  the company revised its probability assessment related to its requirement to physically remove its underground network infrastructure at the end of the underlying row terms  which caused a significant reduction to the related estimated cash flows that the company believes will be required to settle its row asset retirement obligations 
the company reduced its asset retirement obligation liability accordingly during the fourth quarter of as part of the row asset retirement obligation change in estimate  the company determined that certain of its asset retirement obligations for acquired entities should have been higher at the acquisition date 
as a result  the company increased goodwill by approximately million as of december  the company also determined that its estimates of restoration costs for its leased facility asset retirement obligations were too high based on current costs to restore 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  the company reduced its estimates of the cash flows that it believes will be required to settle its leased facility asset retirement obligations at the end of the respective lease terms  which resulted in a reduction to the company s asset retirement obligation liability 
as a result of the aforementioned revisions in the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for asset retirement obligations  the company reduced its asset retirement obligation liability by million with an offsetting reduction to property  plant and equipment of million  general and administrative expenses of million  depreciation and amortization of million and an increase to goodwill of million in the company reduced property  plant and equipment to the extent of the carrying amount of the related long lived asset initially recorded when the asset retirement obligation liability was established 
the remaining amount of the reduction to the asset retirement obligation was recorded as a reduction to depreciation expense  to the extent of historical depreciation of the related long lived asset  and selling  general and administrative expense 
there were no significant changes made to the company s assumptions or estimates used in determining the asset retirement obligations in recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued revised guidance on business combinations  which replaces the existing guidance on business combinations 
the revised guidance retains the underlying concepts of the existing guidance in that an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value on the acquisition date 
the revised guidance changes the accounting treatment for certain specific acquisition related items to 
table of contents require expensing acquisition related costs as incurred  expensing changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date  valuing noncontrolling interests at fair value at the acquisition date  generally expensing restructuring costs associated with an acquired business  capitalizing in process research and development assets acquired  and measuring acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination at fair value on the acquisition date as opposed to the announcement date 
the revised guidance also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
the revised guidance is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  the effect of adopting this guidance on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition will be largely dependent on the size and nature of any business combinations completed on or after january  in april  the fasb issued additional guidance to address application issues on initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting  and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
this guidance is effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  the effect of adopting this guidance on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition will be largely dependent on the size and nature of any business combinations completed on or after january  in october  the fasb issued a new accounting standard that provides revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
specifically  the new standard requires an entity to allocate consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in the absence of the vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling prices  consideration must be allocated to the deliverables based on management s best estimate of the selling prices 
in addition  the new standard eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation 
this guidance is generally expected to result in revenue recognition for more delivered elements than under the current rules 
level is required to adopt this guidance prospectively for new or materially modified agreements as of january  the company is evaluating the effect of this guidance  but does not expect adoption to have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard that changes the consolidation rules as they relate to variable interest entities 
the new standard makes significant changes to the model for determining who should consolidate a variable interest entity  and also addresses how often this assessment should be performed 
the standard is effective for level effective january  the company is currently evaluating the effect of this guidance  but would not expect it to have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition

other communications services includes revenue from managed modem and its related reciprocal compensation services and sbc contract services  which includes revenue from the sbc master services agreement  which was obtained in the december acquisition of wiltel 

table of contents communications revenue attributable to each of these services is as follows year ended december  dollars in millions core communications services core network services wholesale voice services total core communications services other communications services total communications services revenue communications revenue decreased in compared to contributing to this decline in communications revenue was a decrease in core communications services revenue  which included declines in the company s core network services and wholesale voice services revenue  and is generally the result of macroeconomic conditions driving increased customer monthly recurring revenue churn  usage revenue declines  customers delaying the purchase of communications services  customers self serving and optimizing their own networks for communications services and the lag effect of prior customer experience issues  particularly for mid market enterprise customers 
the company experienced declines within core network services in compared to  including transport  vyvx broadcast data services  local voice and enterprise voice services 
the decrease in transport revenue is primarily the result of macroeconomic conditions causing customers to optimize their own networks as opposed to utilizing the company s network and delays in customer sales cycles 
the decrease in vyvx broadcast data services is primarily the result of macroeconomic conditions causing lower usage as customers generally cut back on the number of broadcasting events they covered 
the decrease in local voice and enterprise voice services is primarily the result of macroeconomic conditions causing lower voice usage 
in addition  revenue associated with the vyvx advertising distribution business declined in compared to as  on june   the company completed the sale of the vyvx advertising distribution business and therefore did not record any vyvx advertising distribution revenue subsequent to the date of sale 
revenue attributable to the vyvx advertising distribution business was million in partially offsetting the decreases in transport  vyvx broadcast data services  vyvx advertising distribution services and local voice and enterprise voice revenue were increases in infrastructure revenue in compared to the company continues to experience favorable demand for infrastructure services for complex nationwide solutions and colocation capacity in large markets 
the decrease in wholesale voice services revenue is primarily attributable to a decrease in domestic and international voice termination services  which was caused by price declines and lower usage 
partially offsetting the decrease in domestic and international voice termination revenue was an increase in toll free revenue due to higher traffic attributable to conferencing provider customers 
the company continues to concentrate its sales efforts on maintaining incremental gross margins in the range for these services 
the company may experience volatility in revenue as a result of this strategy 
other communications services revenue declined to million in from million in the decrease is primarily the result of an expected decline related to sbc contract services and a decline in managed modem revenue as a result of the continued migration from narrow band dial up services to higher speed broadband services by end user customers  especially in large metropolitan areas 
in addition  the company renewed contracts with certain of its managed modem customers during the year at reduced prices 
the company expects managed modem revenue to continue to decline in the future due to an increase in the number of subscribers migrating to broadband services 

table of contents also contributing to the decrease in other communications revenue was lower sbc contract services revenue as a result of the migration of the sbc traffic to the at t network and the satisfaction by sbc of its gross margin commitment under the sbc master services agreement in the first half of during the second quarter of  the gross margin commitment on the sbc master services agreement was satisfied  however at t  inc at t  which merged with sbc in  continues to purchase services from level under the sbc master services agreement as it continues to migrate the services provided under the agreement to its own network facilities 
the sbc master services agreement was an agreement between sbc services inc and wiltel and was obtained in the wiltel acquisition 
reciprocal compensation revenue from managed modem services also declined in compared to as a result of the continuing decline in demand for managed modem services 
the company has historically earned the majority of its reciprocal compensation revenue from managed modem services  although the company continues to generate a portion of its reciprocal compensation revenue from voice services  which is reported within core network services revenue 
to the extent the company is unable to sign new interconnection agreements or signs new agreements containing lower rates  or there is a significant decline in the company s managed modem dial up business  or fcc or state regulations change such that carriers are not required to compensate other carriers for terminating isp bound traffic  reciprocal compensation revenue may experience further declines over time 
coal mining revenue decreased to million in from million in primarily as a result of a long term supply contract that enabled a customer to buyout future coal purchase commitments with the company in the first quarter of the company did not have any further obligations with respect to future coal commitments under the contract  and therefore recognized the transaction as revenue in the first quarter of also contributing to the decrease are the lower contractual selling prices with customers based on their purchasing volumes 
partially offsetting this decrease is a customer buyout of future coal purchase commitments under its contract which was completed and recognized in cost of revenue for the communications business includes leased capacity  right of way costs  access charges  satellite transponder lease costs  and other third party costs directly attributable to the network  but excludes depreciation and amortization and related impairment expenses 
prior to the sale of the vyvx advertising distribution business  the company included in communications cost of revenue package delivery costs and the blank tape media costs associated with this business 
cost of revenue for the communications business  as a percentage of communications revenue  was in compared to in the decrease in communications cost of revenue as a percentage of communications revenue is the result of the company deriving synergies from acquisitions which eliminate duplicate network costs 
in addition  the continued reduction in sbc contract services revenue has improved communications cost of revenue as a percentage of communications revenue  as the gross margins for sbc contract services revenue are lower than the gross margins for core communications services revenue 
partially offsetting this downward trend in communications cost of revenue as a percentage of communications revenue have been increases in wholesale voice services revenue as a percentage of total communications revenue and lower managed modem revenue 
the incremental gross margins for wholesale voice services revenue are in the range versus an range for core network services revenue  and the gross margin for managed modem revenue is generally higher than for core network services revenue 
cost of revenue as a percentage of communications revenue could increase in periods in which revenue volumes are lower as fixed costs would become dilutive to gross margin 
coal mining cost of revenue decreased to million in from million in coal mining cost of revenue approximated of coal mining revenue in compared to in 
table of contents this increase in coal mining cost of revenue as a percentage of coal mining revenue is the result of the buyout by a coal customer of future coal purchase commitments resulting in the recognition of revenue with no associated costs in depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced depreciation expense associated with shorter lived fixed assets becoming fully depreciated 
also contributing to the decrease was a reduction in amortization expense on intangible assets due to the disposal of million of carrying value of amortizable intangible assets in the vyvx advertising distribution sale and certain of the company s amortizable intangible assets becoming fully amortized in selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries  wages and related benefits including non cash  stock based compensation expenses  property taxes  travel  insurance  rent  contract maintenance  advertising  accretion expense on asset retirement obligations and other administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include certain network related expenses such as network facility rent  utilities and maintenance costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to billion in from billion in the decreases are primarily attributable to a reduction in employee compensation and related costs due to a lower average headcount  which decreased approximately in compared to also contributing to the reduction in employee compensation and related costs were lower bonus expenses  as a result of the reduction in the company s revenue and adjusted ebitda performance 
offsetting the decrease in the change in selling  general and administrative expenses is an million benefit that was the result of a revision in the company s estimate of its asset retirement obligations liability in the fourth quarter of the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was also the result of synergies that have been achieved due to acquisition integration efforts and the company s focus on reducing operating expenses  which resulted in decreases in professional fees and vendor services  and network related administrative expenses 
also contributing to the decrease is a reduction in the accretion on asset retirement obligations in compared to as a result of the reduction in the estimate of the asset retirement obligation recorded on december  included in selling  general and administrative expenses in was million of non cash  stock based compensation expenses related to grants of outperform stock options and restricted stock units and restricted stock shares 
this compares to million of non cash  stock based compensation expenses recognized in this decrease in non cash  stock based compensation expense is primarily due to lower headcount  higher estimated forfeiture rates given the company s continued organizational structure optimization efforts and a reduction in the company s k stock based matching contribution  as effective march   the company matches of employee contributions up to of eligible earnings or applicable regulatory limits 
prior to march   the company matched of employee contributions up to of eligible earnings or applicable regulatory limits 
restructuring charges decreased to million in from million in primarily as a result of the timing of the company s workforce reduction activities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more details 
the company may experience further restructuring charges in as it continues to optimize its cost structure if revenue performance does not improve 
adjusted ebitda  as defined by the company  is net income loss from the consolidated statements of operations before income taxes  total other income expense  non cash impairment charges included within restructuring charges  depreciation and amortization and non cash stock compensation expense included within selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents adjusted ebitda is not a measurement under gaap and may not be used in the same way by other companies 
management believes that adjusted ebitda is an important part of the company s internal reporting and is a key measure used by management to evaluate profitability and operating performance of the company and to make resource allocation decisions 
management believes such measurement is especially important in a capital intensive industry such as telecommunications 
management also uses adjusted ebitda to compare the company s performance to that of its competitors and to eliminate certain non cash and non operating items in order to consistently measure from period to period its ability to fund capital expenditures  fund growth  service debt and determine bonuses 
adjusted ebitda excludes non cash impairment charges and non cash stock compensation expense because of the non cash nature of these items 
adjusted ebitda also excludes interest income  interest expense  gain on extinguishment of debt  net and income taxes because these items are associated with the company s capitalization and tax structures 
adjusted ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expense because these non cash expenses reflect the effect of capital investments which management believes should be evaluated through cash flow measures 
adjusted ebitda excludes net other income expense because these items are not related to the primary operations of the company 
there are limitations to using non gaap financial measures  including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from the company s calculations 
additionally  this financial measure does not include certain significant items such as interest income  interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment charges  non cash stock compensation expense  gain on extinguishment of debt  net and other income expense  net 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda for each of the company s reportable operating segments 
adjusted ebitda for the communications business was million in compared to billion in the decrease in adjusted ebitda for the communications business is primarily attributable to a reduction in communications revenue partially offset by the benefits of continued operating expense reductions 
interest income decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the average return on the company s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and securities balances  partially offset by an increase in the average invested balance during as compared to the average invested balance during the company invests its funds primarily in government and government agency securities  money market funds and commercial paper depending on liquidity requirements

the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate instruments at december   was approximately 
in march  level financing  inc  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  entered into two interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest payments on billion notional amount of floating rate debt 
the two interest rate swap agreements are with different counterparties and are for million each
