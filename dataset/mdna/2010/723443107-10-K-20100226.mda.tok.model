our company pinnacle airlines corp 
was incorporated in as a delaware corporation 
as of december   we had two reportable segments consisting of pinnacle and colgan 
information on our segments operating revenues  operating income  total assets  and other financial measures can be found in note  segment reporting  in item of this form k 
pinnacle operates an all regional jet fleet  and provides regional airline capacity to delta at its hub airports in atlanta  detroit  memphis  and minneapolis st 
paul 
at december   pinnacle operated canadair regional jet crj aircraft under delta brands with approximately daily departures to cities in states and three canadian provinces 
pinnacle also operated a fleet of crj aircraft as a delta connection carrier with approximately daily departures to cities in states  belize  mexico  canada and the us virgin islands 
item business our company continued colgan operates an all turboprop fleet under a regional airline capacity purchase agreement cpa with continental  and under revenue pro rate agreements with continental  united and us airways 
colgan s operations are focused primarily in the northeastern united states and in texas 
as of december   colgan offered within its pro rate operations daily departures to cities in ten states and the district of columbia 
colgan operated saab aircraft as continental connection from continental s hub airport in houston  saab aircraft as united express at washington dulles  and ten saab aircraft as us airways express  at new york laguardia and boston  under revenue pro rate agreements 
colgan operated bombardier q aircraft providing daily departures to cities in states  the district of columbia and two canadian provinces as continental connection at continental s global hub at newark liberty international airport 
operating platforms regional jet operation pinnacle serves as our platform for regional jet operations 
pinnacle operates regional jets under two cpas with delta 
our jet fleet consists of seat crj aircraft and seat crj aircraft operating in the delta network 
our business strategy is to provide our major airline partners with safe  highly reliable and cost efficient operations that distinguish us from our competitors 
we are focused on providing excellent customer service and providing a safe and high quality travel experience 
pinnacle s unit cost continues to be competitive in the regional airline industry 
turboprop operation colgan serves as our platform for turboprop operations  providing a similar level of safe  reliable  and cost efficient operations for our partners 
colgan operates the seat q turboprop aircraft under a cpa with continental 
the q regional aircraft offers superior operating performance at a lower cost than similarly sized regional jets 
colgan also operates under revenue pro rate agreements with continental  united  and us airways  utilizing the saab aircraft  a seat turboprop aircraft 
competition and economic conditions the airline industry is highly competitive 
pinnacle and colgan compete principally with other code sharing regional airlines 
in addition  through its revenue pro rate agreements  colgan competes in certain markets with regional airlines operating without code share agreements  as well as low cost carriers and major airlines 
our primary competitors among regional airlines with capacity purchase arrangements include comair  inc comair  compass airlines  inc 
compass  and mesaba aviation  inc mesaba all of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of delta  air wisconsin airlines corporation  american eagle holding corporation amr eagle a wholly owned subsidiary of amr corporation  expressjet holdings  inc expressjet  horizon air industries  inc horizon a wholly owned subsidiary of alaska air group inc  mesa air group  inc 
mesa  republic airways holdings inc republic  skywest  inc 
skywest  and trans states airlines  inc the principal competitive factors for regional airlines with capacity purchase agreements include the overall cost of the agreement  customer service  aircraft types  and operating performance 
many of the regional airlines competing for capacity purchase arrangements are larger  and may have greater financial and other resources than pinnacle and colgan 
additionally  regional carriers owned by major airlines  such as amr eagle  comair  horizon  and mesaba  may have access to greater resources at the parent level than pinnacle and colgan  and may have enhanced competitive advantages because they are subsidiaries of major airlines 
item business competition and economic conditions continued our competition within our pro rate operations includes other domestic regional airlines and  to a certain extent  major and low cost domestic carriers that maintain operations in the markets that we serve 
the principal competitive factors we experience with respect to our pro rate flying include fare pricing  customer service  routes served  flight schedules  aircraft types and relationships with major partners 
moreover  competitors may easily shift capacity to enter our pro rate markets and to offer discounted fares 
the airline industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only nominal incremental costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats 
the airline industry is highly sensitive to general economic conditions  in large part due to the discretionary nature of a substantial percentage of both business and leisure travel 
many airlines have historically reported lower earnings or substantial losses during periods of economic recession  heavy fare discounting  high fuel costs and other disadvantageous environments 
in the past  economic downturns combined with competitive pressures have contributed to a number of reorganizations  bankruptcies  liquidations and business combinations among major and regional carriers 
we are somewhat insulated from the effect of economic downturns by the fact that most of our operations are conducted under capacity purchase agreements 
nonetheless  to the extent that our partners experience financial difficulties  they may seek ways to amend the terms of our capacity purchase agreements in a way that negatively affects our financial results 
additionally  colgan s pro rate operations  which operate similarly to an independent airline  are more directly affected by changes in the economy 
industry overview the airline industry in the united states has traditionally been dominated by several major airlines  including american airlines  inc  continental  delta  us airways and united 
low cost carriers  such as southwest airlines co 
southwest  jetblue airways corporation jetblue  frontier airlines  inc frontier and airtran airways  inc airtran  generally offer fewer premium services to travelers and have lower cost structures than major airlines  which permits them to offer flights to and from many of the same markets as the major airlines  but at lower prices 
low cost carriers typically fly direct flights with limited service to smaller cities  concentrating on higher demand routes to and from major population bases 
regional airlines  such as expressjet  mesa and skywest  typically operate smaller aircraft on lower volume routes than major and low cost carriers 
several regional airlines  including amr eagle  comair  compass  horizon  and mesaba  are wholly owned subsidiaries of major airlines 
in contrast to low cost carriers  regional airlines generally do not seek to establish an independent route system to compete with the major airlines 
rather  regional airlines typically enter into relationships with one or more major airlines  pursuant to which the regional airline agrees to use its smaller  lower cost aircraft to carry passengers ticketed by the major airline between a hub of the major airline and a smaller outlying city 
in exchange for such services  the major airline pays the regional airline either a fixed flight fee  termed capacity purchase or fixed fee flights  or the regional airline receives a percentage of applicable ticket revenues  termed pro rate or revenue sharing flights 
the growth in the number of passengers using regional airlines and the revenues of regional airlines during the last decade is attributable primarily to the introduction of regional jets and their popularity with major airlines 
major airlines sought to add regional jets in many markets to replace smaller turboprop aircraft and slightly larger narrowbody jets 
by adding regional jets  hub and spoke carriers were able to increase the scope of their network by serving markets that could not be supported by a narrowbody aircraft  reduce the operating cost in markets previously supported by narrowbody jets  and increase the level of passenger service in smaller markets previously serviced with turboprop aircraft 
item business industry overview continued key to this strategy was the ability to outsource regional jet operations to regional airlines through the use of capacity purchase arrangements 
regional airlines tend to have a more favorable cost structure and leaner corporate structure than many major airlines 
in addition  the complexities of multiple fleet types at an airline can increase costs because of the need to maintain multiple aircraft maintenance functions and multiple flight crew training functions 
by outsourcing regional jet operations to regional airlines  major airlines can reduce the number of aircraft types in their operating fleet while still enjoying the flexibility and revenue production that regional jets provide to their passenger network 
however  several major airlines have publicly indicated that their committed supply of regional airline capacity is larger than they desire given current market conditions 
regional airlines generally enter into code share agreements with major airlines  pursuant to which the regional airline is authorized to use the major airline s two letter flight designator codes to identify the regional airline s flights and fares in the central reservation systems  to paint its aircraft with the colors and or logos of its code share partner and to market and advertise its status as a carrier for the code share partner 
for example  pinnacle flies out of detroit  minneapolis st 
paul  memphis  and atlanta under delta brands 
colgan operates as continental connection out of newark and houston  united express out of washington dulles  and us airways express with significant operations at boston and new york laguardia 
in addition  the major airline generally provides services such as reservations  ticketing  ground support and gate access to the regional airline  and both partners often coordinate marketing  advertising and other promotional efforts 
in exchange  the regional airline provides a designated number of low capacity usually between and seats flights between larger airports served by the major airline and surrounding cities  usually in lower volume markets 
our operating contracts our operating contracts fall primarily into two categories cpas and revenue pro rate agreements 
the following table presents for the year ended december  the percentage of our regional airline services revenue derived under each contract type and by code share partner percentage of regional airline service revenue pro rate agreements source of revenue capacity purchase agreements standard modified total delta continental united us airways essential air service total capacity purchase agreements 
our preferred contractual relationships with major airlines are structured as capacity purchase arrangements 
under cpas  our major airline partners purchase our flying capacity by paying pre determined rates for specified flying  regardless of the number of passengers on board or the amount of revenue collected from passengers 
these arrangements typically include incentive payments that are paid if we meet certain operational performance measures 
additionally  certain operating costs such as fuel  aviation insurance premiums  and ground handling are reimbursed or provided directly by the partner  which eliminates our risk associated with a change in the price of these goods or services 
we believe the capacity purchase model reduces our financial risk and enables us to focus on operating our business with the highest standards  while maximizing the efficiencies of the business that we provide to our partners 
therefore  we are focused on growing the percentage of our revenue derived from these types of agreements by working to structure new business with capacity purchase terms 
item business our operating contracts continued pinnacle s amended and restated airline services agreement the crj asa pertaining to its crj operations and its delta connection agreement pertaining to its crj operations crj dca are both structured as cpas 
in addition  colgan s q operations for continental are under a cpa the continental cpa 
under our cpas  most costs we incur are classified as one of the following reimbursed those costs that are reimbursed to the full extent of the actual cost  plus any applicable margin 
rate based we receive payments for each block hour and departure we provide and based upon the number of aircraft in our fleet 
these payments are designed to cover all of our expenses incurred with respect to the cpa that are not covered by the reimbursement payments  including overhead costs  but we assume the risk that our underlying costs for these activities differ from the assumptions used to negotiate the rates 
excluded services that are provided by or paid for directly by the code share partner 
these costs do not appear on our financial statements 
the following is a summary of the treatment of certain costs under our three cpas 
continental cpa crj dca crj asa aircraft ownership rate based reimbursed reimbursed aviation insurance reimbursed reimbursed reimbursed commissions and passenger distribution costs excluded excluded excluded facility rentals excluded excluded rate based fuel excluded excluded excluded ground handling excluded excluded rate based heavy maintenance rate based reimbursed reimbursed labor costs rate based rate based rate based landing fees station costs reimbursed reimbursed rate based line maintenance rate based rate based rate based non aircraft depreciation rate based rate based rate based other g a and training rate based rate based rate based property taxes rate based reimbursed reimbursed reimbursement of these costs are both subject to a cap and adjusted downward should actual expenses incurred be less than the payments received 
aircraft ownership reimbursements under the crj dca are based on principal and interest payments on debt associated with each aircraft 
ground handling and airport facilities are provided free of charge unless our partner asks us to perform ground handling in a station 
in these instances  we are compensated based upon negotiated ground handling rates 
landing fees that we incur in detroit are reimbursed directly 
all other landing fees in our crj operation are rate based 
in addition  in certain cities under our crj asa  delta provides or arranges for ground handling services on our behalf 
our costs for these ground handling services  which include most other facility costs  are capped under the crj asa 
item business our operating contracts continued revenue pro rate agreements 
in addition to the continental cpa  colgan operates under contracts structured as revenue pro rate code share agreements  which allow for colgan to market its operations under its partners brands 
under these agreements  colgan generally manages its own inventory of unsold capacity and sets fare levels in the local markets that it serves 
colgan retains all of the revenue for passenger flying within colgan s local markets and not connecting to its partners flights 
for connecting passengers  the passenger fare is pro rated between colgan and its major airline partner  generally based on the distance traveled by the passenger on each segment of the passenger s trip or on a comparison of unrestricted local fares within each segment 
under these agreements  colgan bears the risk associated with fares  passenger demand  and competition within its markets 
colgan incurs all of the costs associated with operating these flights  including those costs typically reimbursed or paid directly by the major airline under a capacity purchase agreement 
in some instances  colgan has the ability to earn incentive based revenue should it achieve specified performance metrics 
colgan s revenue pro rate agreement with continental is a modified pro rate agreement in that it also contains a connecting passenger incentive designed to maintain a base level of revenue in the houston markets that colgan serves 
the connect incentive can be a payment from or a payment to continental  depending on certain variables such as load factors  and is designed to create a more stable revenue level in these markets than could otherwise be supported under a traditional revenue pro rate agreement 
the connect incentives rates are adjusted twice a year for changes in fuel prices and certain station passenger related costs 
colgan s revenue pro rate agreement with united is also a modified pro rate agreement in that it includes a fixed connecting passenger incentive payment designed to subsidize some of the markets that colgan operates in as united express 
these markets would not be profitable on a stand alone basis without the connecting passenger incentive 
the incentive amount is fixed for the three year term of the agreement and may only be adjusted upon the concurrence of both colgan and united 
colgan has the ability to exit these markets to the extent that the markets can no longer be operated profitably with the fixed connecting passenger incentive payment 
in addition to operating its flights under revenue pro rate code share agreements  colgan also operates some flights within its revenue pro rate networks under essential air service eas contracts with the department of transportation dot 
the eas program provides a federal government subsidy within certain small markets that could not otherwise sustain commercial air service because of limited passenger demand 
pinnacle s agreements with major airlines crj airline services agreement pinnacle provides regional jet service to delta operating seat crj aircraft under the crj asa 
at the end of its term in  the crj asa automatically extends for additional five year periods unless delta provides notice to us two years prior to the termination date that it does not plan to extend the term 
in addition to the rate based and reimbursed payments previously detailed  our crj asa with delta provides for margin payments 
the current rate based payments will be in effect subject to indexed annual inflation adjustments through the end of  when a negotiated rate reset will occur  which is designed to adjust our rate based compensation to cover our actual costs at that time 
we receive a monthly margin payment based on the payments described above calculated to achieve a target operating margin of 
delta does not guarantee pinnacle s minimum operating margin  although we are subject to a margin ceiling above the target operating margin 
if pinnacle s actual operating margin related to its operations under the crj asa for any year exceeds the target operating margin but is less than  pinnacle will make a year end adjustment payment to delta in an amount equal to half of the excess above 
if pinnacle s actual operating margin for any year exceeds  pinnacle will pay delta all of the excess above 
margin calculations under the crj asa exclude amounts recognized as deferred asa revenue  which is discussed in detail in note  code share agreements  in item of this form k 
item business pinnacle s agreements with major airlines continued the crj asa provides that we will be required to negotiate with delta an adjustment to our rates to the extent that we establish operations with another major airline 
under the crj asa  upon reaching a certain level of operations outside of our crj asa  and to the extent that we have realized operating cost efficiencies from combining overhead in such outside operations  we will negotiate a rate reduction to the fixed payment that we receive under our crj asa related to our overhead 
we have discussed our current level of operations outside the crj asa with delta  and in early  we reached a tentative agreement to provide for a prospective rate reduction of million in and million in  and million in under this provision of the crj asa 
we do not expect this provision to result in further adjustments to our contract billings prior to our rate reset effective at the end of to the extent that pinnacle operates regional jets on behalf of another major airline  delta may remove one aircraft for every two aircraft that pinnacle operates for another partner above an initial base of regional jets 
delta may remove no more than aircraft subject to this option and no more than five aircraft in any month period 
delta may only exercise this option if the removed aircraft are not operated by or on behalf of delta after their removal 
delta may terminate the crj asa at any time for cause 
delta may also terminate the agreement at any time upon our bankruptcy or for any breach of the agreement by us that continues uncured for more than days after we receive notice of the breach 
however  in the case of a non monetary default  delta may not terminate the agreement if the default would take more than days to cure and we are diligently attempting to cure the default 
in addition  both delta and we are entitled to seek an injunction and specific performance for a breach of the agreement 
in general  we have agreed to indemnify delta and delta has agreed to indemnify us for any damages caused by any breaches of our respective obligations under the crj asa or caused by our respective actions or inaction under the crj asa 
we recently reached a tentative agreement with delta entered to resolve various other issues related to the crj asa 
these issues and their resolution are discussed in greater detail in note  code share agreements  in item of this form k 
crj delta connection agreement crj dca pinnacle provides regional jet service to delta operating seat crj aircraft under the crj dca 
the crj dca provides that pinnacle operate crj aircraft under a capacity purchase agreement 
the crj dca allows delta the option to add an additional seven crj aircraft to the fleet 
the crj dca provides for delta to pay pre set rates based on the capacity we provide to delta 
we are responsible for the costs of flight crews  maintenance  dispatch  aircraft ownership and general and administrative costs 
in addition  delta reimburses us for certain pass through costs  including landing fees  most station related costs to the extent that we incur them and aircraft hull and general liability insurance 
in most instances  delta will provide fuel and ground handling services free of charge 
we earn incentive payments calculated as a percentage of the payments received from delta if we meet certain performance targets 
the crj dca also provides for reimbursements to delta annually to the extent that our actual pre tax margin on our delta connection operations exceeds certain thresholds 
the crj dca terminates for each aircraft upon the tenth anniversary of the in service date of such aircraft 
upon the sixth anniversary of the agreement date  which is april   either party has the right under the crj dca to remove from the terms of the agreement up to of the crj aircraft each year thereafter 
item business pinnacle s agreements with major airlines continued to the extent that either party materially breaches the crj dca and such breach remains uncured for a period of days  the non breaching party may terminate the agreement 
in addition  delta may temporarily suspend or terminate the crj dca in the event of certain force majeure events that prevent either party from performing its obligations under the crj dca 
delta may also terminate the crj dca upon certain corporate transactions such as a merger or change of control involving the company  our failure to maintain a certain level of safety  our failure to maintain certain specified operational performance standards  our failure to adhere to various governmental operating regulations  our failure to maintain certain certifications and authorities  a material breach by us of our purchase agreement for our crj aircraft with the manufacturer  or our failure to maintain specified levels of insurance 
delta may also terminate the crj dca if pinnacle commences operating a fleet type that causes delta to be in violation of the collective bargaining agreement with its pilots 
colgan s agreements with major airlines continental connection capacity purchase agreement continental cpa colgan operates seat q turboprop regional aircraft predominantly out of continental s hub at newark liberty international airport 
colgan entered into the ten year continental cpa on february   which terminates for each aircraft upon the tenth anniversary of the in service date of such aircraft 
operations began on february   and we currently operate q aircraft under the continental cpa 
in early  we amended the continental cpa to add an additional q aircraft  which are expected to deliver between august and april the continental cpa provides that we are compensated at pre set rates for the capacity that we provide to continental 
we are responsible for our own expenses associated with flight crews  maintenance  dispatch  aircraft ownership and general and administrative costs 
in addition  continental reimburses us without a markup for certain reconciled costs  such as landing fees  most station related costs not otherwise provided by continental or its designee  aircraft hull and passenger liability insurance provided that our insurance rates do not exceed those typically found at other continental regional airline partners and passenger related costs 
continental will also provide to colgan at no charge fuel and ground handling services at its stations 
continental may request that we provide ground handling for our flights at certain stations  in which case  we will be compensated at a predetermined rate for these ground handling services 
the continental cpa also provides for the ability to earn additional incentive based revenue based upon achieving operational and financial performance targets 
the continental cpa provides for a rate reduction to continental to the extent that we begin operating q aircraft for another major airline 
the rate reduction is designed to share the overhead burden associated with the q aircraft across all of our potential q operations and is only applicable for the first aircraft that we add with another airline 
continental may immediately terminate the continental cpa following the occurrence of any event that constitutes cause 
to the extent that either party materially breaches the continental cpa and such breach remains uncured for a period of days  the non breaching party may terminate the agreement 
continental may also terminate the cpa upon certain corporate transactions such as a merger or change of control involving the company  our failure to maintain a certain level of safety  our failure to maintain certain specified operational performance standards  or our failure to maintain various governmental certifications and to comply with various governmental operating regulations and authorities 
item business colgan s agreements with major airlines continued continental connection pro rate agreement we operate saab aircraft based in houston  texas under a code share agreement with continental the continental agreement 
colgan entered into the continental agreement in january for a term of five years 
the continental agreement is structured as a modified pro rate agreement for which we receive all of the fares associated with local passengers and an allocated portion of the connecting passengers fares 
we pay all of the costs of operating the flights  including sales and distribution costs 
however  we also receive connect incentive payments from continental for passengers connecting from colgan operated flights to any flights operated by continental or its other code share partners at houston george bush intercontinental airport 
the connect incentive payments are designed to maintain a base level of profitability in the markets that we fly out of houston  and can result in a payment to us or from us depending on our passenger load factor in these markets 
the connect incentives are modified every six months to adjust for prospective modifications in fuel prices and certain station expenses 
we are currently in discussions with continental about extending and or modifying this agreement beyond its initial five year term  which ends in the second quarter of us airways express agreement we operate ten saab aircraft under a code share agreement with us airways the us airways agreement 
colgan entered into the us airways agreement in to provide passenger service and cargo service under the name us airways express 
the us airways agreement provides us use of the us airways flight designator code to identify flights and fares in computer reservations systems  permits use of logos  service marks  aircraft paint schemes  and uniforms similar to those used by us airways and coordinated scheduling and joint advertising 
the us airways agreement is structured as a revenue pro rate agreement for which we receive all of the fares associated with our local passengers and an allocated portion of connecting passengers fares 
we pay all of the costs of operating the flights  including sales and distribution costs 
we control all scheduling  inventory and pricing for each local market we serve 
the current three year us airways agreement became effective on october  under terms similar to the agreement 
since the end of the three year term in  the us airways agreement continues to automatically extend for multiple six month periods until either party provides notice to terminate 
united express agreement in october  colgan entered into a code share agreement with united to provide services as a united express carrier the united express agreement 
the united express agreement was amended and restated effective november  and expires on november  colgan currently operates saab aircraft under the name united express 
the united express agreement is structured as a modified pro rate agreement for which we receive all of the fares associated with local passengers and an allocated portion of the connecting passengers fares 
in addition  united pays us a set passenger connect incentive fee for certain of the markets that we operate under the united express agreement 
the passenger connect incentive may only be adjusted during the three year term by mutual consent of the parties 
we have the right  however  to cease serving certain of these markets to the extent that our operations are not profitable 
we pay all of the costs of operating the flights  including sales and distribution costs 
we jointly coordinate with united all scheduling  inventory and pricing for each local market we serve 
item business employees as of december   we had  employees 
flight attendants and ground operations agents included and part time employees  respectively 
the part time employees work varying amounts of time  but typically work half time or less 
the follow table details the number of employees by company and by group employee group pinnacle airlines corp 
pinnacle airlines  inc colgan air  inc total pilots flight attendants ground operations personnel mechanics and other maintenance personnel dispatchers and crew resource personnel management and support personnel total labor costs are a significant component of airline expenses and can substantially affect our results 
approximately and of pinnacle airlines  inc and colgan air  inc 
employees  respectively  are represented by unions 
the following table reflects our principal collective bargaining agreements and their respective amendable dates employee group employees represented representing union contract amendable date pinnacle s pilots air line pilots association april  colgan s pilots air line pilots association pending pinnacle s flight attendants united steel workers of america february  colgan s flight attendants united steel workers of america april  pinnacle s ground operations agents united steel workers of america march  pinnacle s flight dispatchers transport workers union of america december  initial contract negotiations commenced in october and are ongoing 
the colgan flight attendant agreement with the united steel workers of america is amendable on april  with the exception of a wage only review  which could occur in april the company is currently in negotiations with the united steel workers of america in advance of the amendable date the railway labor act  which governs labor relations for unions representing airline employees  contains detailed provisions that must be exhausted before work stoppage can occur once a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable 
item business employees continued the collective bargaining agreement between pinnacle and the air line pilots association alpa became amendable in april pinnacle has been actively negotiating with alpa since that time 
in august  pinnacle filed for mediation with the national mediation board 
since then  pinnacle has met with the federal mediator assigned to its case and with alpa 
on august   pinnacle and alpa reached a tentative agreement to amend the collective bargaining agreement 
the tentative agreement contained substantial wage rate increases and a proposed million signing bonus for pinnacle s pilots 
however  on september   pinnacle s pilots voted against ratification of the tentative agreement 
the national mediation board will determine when the parties will resume negotiations 
aircraft maintenance using a combination of faa certified maintenance vendors and our own personnel and facilities  we maintain our aircraft on a scheduled and as needed basis 
we perform preventive maintenance and inspect our engines and airframes in accordance with our faa approved maintenance policies and procedures 
the maintenance performed on our aircraft can be divided into three general categories line maintenance  heavy maintenance checks  and engine and component overhaul and repair 
line maintenance consists of routine daily and weekly scheduled maintenance inspections on our aircraft  including pre flight  daily  weekly and overnight checks and any diagnostic and routine repairs 
pinnacle contracts with an affiliate of the original equipment manufacturer of its crj s to perform certain routine heavy maintenance checks on its aircraft 
pinnacle also contracts with a third party to perform engine overhauls on its crj fleet 
these maintenance checks are regularly performed on a schedule approved by the manufacturer and the faa 
in general  both the crj and crj aircraft do not require their first heavy maintenance checks until they have flown approximately  hours 
the average age of the crj and crj regional jets in our fleet as of december  was approximately years and years  respectively 
colgan performs its own heavy maintenance airframe checks for its saab fleet at its maintenance facility in houston  texas  and occasionally contracts with third party vendors for heavy maintenance airframe checks on an as needed basis 
colgan contracts with third parties to perform engine overhauls and propeller maintenance on its saab fleet 
colgan plans to use a combination of internal and third party resources to complete heavy maintenance requirements on its q fleet 
in general  the q aircraft do not require their first heavy maintenance checks until they have flown approximately  hours 
the average age of the q aircraft in our fleet as of december  was approximately years 
component overhaul and repair involves sending parts  such as engines  landing gear and avionics to a third party  faa approved maintenance facility 
we are party to maintenance agreements with various vendors covering our aircraft engines  avionics  auxiliary power units and brakes 
training pinnacle performs the majority of its flight personnel training in memphis  tennessee both at its corporate education center and the simulator center operated by flightsafety international 
flightsafety international  at pinnacle s request  provides some overflow training at various other simulator centers throughout the us and canada 
the memphis simulator center currently includes three crj full motion simulators 
under pinnacle s agreement with flightsafety international  pinnacle has first priority on all of the simulator time available in the memphis center 
instructors used in the memphis center are typically pinnacle employees who are either professional instructors or trained line pilot instructors 
colgan s flight personnel are trained at various simulator centers throughout the us and canada under a contract with flightsafety international 
instructors that conduct the training are typically professional instructors or trained line pilot instructors 
recurrent ground training takes place near the colgan hubs including newark  new jersey  washington  dc and houston  texas 
upgrade training of colgan flight personnel is performed at its corporate education center in memphis  tennessee 
item business training continued we provide both internal and outside training for our maintenance personnel 
to maximize value for the company and to ensure our employees receive the highest quality training available  we take advantage of manufacturers training programs offered  particularly when acquiring new aircraft 
we employ professional instructors to conduct training of mechanics  flight attendants and ground operations personnel in memphis and manassas 
safety we are committed to the safety and security of our passengers and employees 
our most important guiding principle is never compromise safety 
for example  pinnacle led the way in the regional airline industry by being one of the first regional airlines to implement the flight operational quality assurance foqa program 
we are currently in the processing of implementing foqa at colgan 
foqa programs involve the collection and analysis of data recorded during flight to improve the safety of flight operations  air traffic control procedures  and airport and aircraft design and maintenance 
in addition  we have implemented the faa s aviation safety action program asap 
asap s focus is to encourage voluntary reporting of safety issues and events that come to the attention of employees of certain certificate holders 
we also maintain a line observation safety audit losa program to obtain a self evaluation of safety procedures that are invaluable in assessing opportunities for enhancing safety in flight operations 
insurance we currently maintain insurance policies with necessary coverage levels for aviation liability  which covers public liability  passenger liability  hangar keepers liability  baggage and cargo liability and property damage liability  war risk  which covers losses arising from acts of war  terrorism or confiscation  hull insurance  which covers loss or damage to our flight equipment  directors and officers insurance  property and casualty insurance for our facilities and ground equipment  and workers compensation insurance 
we were given the option under the air transportation safety and stabilization act  signed into law on september   to purchase certain third party war risk liability insurance from the us government on an interim basis at rates that are more favorable than those available from the private market 
as provided under this act  we have purchased from the faa this war risk liability insurance  which is currently set to expire on august  we expect to renew the policy upon its expiration 
regulations our subsidiaries operate under air carrier certificates issued by the faa and certificates of convenience and necessity issued by the dot 
the dot may alter  amend  modify or suspend these authorizations if the dot determines that we are no longer fit to continue operations 
the faa may suspend or revoke the air carrier certificate of one of our subsidiaries if the subsidiary fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the certificates 
the dot has established regulations affecting the operations and service of the airlines in many areas  including consumer protection  non discrimination against disabled passengers  minimum insurance levels and others 
failure to comply with faa or dot regulations can result in civil penalties  revocation of the right to operate or criminal sanctions 
faa regulations are primarily in the areas of flight operations  maintenance  ground facilities  transportation of hazardous materials and other technical matters 
the faa requires each airline to obtain approval to operate at specific airports using specified equipment 
under faa regulations and with faa approval  our subsidiaries have established a maintenance program for each type of aircraft they operate that provides for the ongoing maintenance of these aircraft  ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls 
as of december   we had no unresolved significant violations 
item business seasonality as with most airlines  we are subject to seasonality  though seasonality has historically had a lesser effect on our capacity purchase operations than it has on our pro rate operations 
mainline carriers use capacity purchase agreements because these arrangements allow them to expand their operations at lower fixed costs by using a regional s lower cost structure for operating aircraft 
because regional aircraft have lower fixed and variable costs than larger aircraft  mainline carriers tend to maintain regional aircraft utilization during seasons of reduced demand 
conversely  our financial results can be materially affected by the level of passenger demand for our services operated under pro rate agreements  under which we more directly bear the risk of decreased demand for our services 
our results can materially vary due to seasonality and cyclicality 
for example  colgan has historically reported significant losses or significantly lower income during the first and fourth quarters of each year when demand for air travel is generally lower  and higher income during the second and third quarters of each year when demand for air travel increases

item a 
risk factors risks related to our financial condition a 
the global financial crisis could affect our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 
while over the past several months the financial and credit markets have begun to stabilize  certain components of the capital markets remain illiquid and the availability of credit constrained 
our prospective access to the capital markets to raise capital may be restricted  which could affect our ability to meet our obligations  our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions and our ability to grow our operations either through expansions of our existing agreements or the addition of new agreements 
additionally  while we currently have no outstanding hedges  the credit crisis could affect future hedging contracts if counterparties are forced to file for bankruptcy or are otherwise unable to perform their obligations 
b 
our fleet expansion program will require a significant increase in our leverage and the related cash outflows 
our recent growth strategy has required significant amounts of capital to acquire crj and q regional aircraft 
as a result  we have significantly increased our total debt obligations and our leverage over the past three years 
during the year ended december   our mandatory debt service payments totaled approximately million  and we expect this amount to increase through april as we acquire and finance additional q aircraft 
see related risk factor a for additional information related to credit availability 
there can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient cash flow or liquidity to enable us to obtain the necessary aircraft acquisition financing for future growth  or to make required debt service payments related to our existing obligations 
if we default under our loan  lease or aircraft purchase agreements  the lender lessor manufacturer has available extensive remedies  including  without limitation  repossession of the respective aircraft and other assets 
even if we meet all required debt  lease  and purchase obligations  the size of these long term obligations could negatively affect our financial condition  results of operations and the price of our common stock in many ways  including increasing the cost  or limiting the availability of  additional financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes  limiting the ways in which we can use our cash flow  much of which may have to be used to satisfy debt and lease obligations  and adversely affecting our ability to respond to changing business or economic conditions or continue our growth strategy 
if we need additional capital and cannot obtain such capital on acceptable terms  or at all  we may be unable to realize our current plans or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities and could be required to slow or stop our growth 
c 
we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations  and if our technology fails  our business may be adversely affected 
our subsidiaries systems operations control centers  which oversee daily flight operations  are dependent on a number of technology systems to operate effectively 
large scale interruption in technology infrastructure that we depend on  such as power  telecommunications or the internet  could cause a substantial disruption in our operations  which could lead to poor operating performance  loss of regional airline services revenue  and financial penalties under our operating contracts 
in some instances  if the disruption to our operations was severe  our major airline partners could have the right to terminate our operating contracts 
item a 
risk factors risks related to our code share agreements d 
there are long term risks related to supply and demand of regional aircraft associated with our regional airline services strategy 
many of our major airline partners have publicly indicated that their committed supply of regional airline capacity is larger than they desire given current market conditions 
specifically  they cite an oversupply of seat regional jets under contractual commitments with regional airlines 
delta in particular has indicated that it plans to reduce both the number of seat regional jets within its network and the number of regional airlines with which it contracts 
there are currently more than seat aircraft within the delta connection system  more than any other major carrier worldwide 
in addition to reducing the number of seat jets under contract  major airlines have reduced the utilization of regional aircraft  thereby reducing the revenue paid to regional airlines under capacity purchase agreements 
the utilization by delta of our seat crj aircraft decreased by in this decrease had a negative impact on our regional airline services revenue and profitability 
mesa airlines  one of our regional airline competitors  recently filed for chapter bankruptcy reorganization 
this was caused in large part by a significant number of regional aircraft that it owns or leases but that are no longer committed to fly under an agreement with a major airline partner 
as major airlines seek to reduce the number of seat aircraft within their networks  other regional airlines may also be forced to restructure their operations 
in an environment where the supply of regional aircraft exceeds the demand from our major airline partners  our competitors may price their regional airline products below cost or otherwise compete aggressively to retain business 
in addition  regional airlines with more financial resources may make loans or pay financial incentives to retain or increase business with major airlines 
for example  skywest airlines recently extended loans of up to million to united in exchange for an extension on the term of some of its regional airline services agreements with united 
regional airlines with more financial resources may also acquire or merge with other regional airlines in an attempt to mitigate any reductions of regional airline services with their major airline partners 
we have fewer financial resources than many of our competitors  and therefore we may be at a competitive disadvantage as we compete for new business opportunities 
additionally  while our crj asa with delta contractually extends through december   delta may still seek to reduce our level of operations  either through reduced utilization of our fleet or through attempted reductions in the number of aircraft that we operate 
oversupply of regional aircraft may also lead to reductions of service under our operating agreements with our other partners 
these reductions in service may lead to reduced profitability and we may be forced to sell  sublease  or otherwise reduce the number of aircraft that we own or lease 
e 
we are highly dependent upon our regional airline services agreements with delta 
we are highly dependent on delta  our largest customer 
our code share agreements with delta generate approximately of our consolidated regional airline service revenue  and nearly of our operating fleet is utilized by delta 
in addition  our entire fleet of crj aircraft is subleased from delta under leases that terminate if our airline services agreement with delta terminates 
we would be significantly negatively affected should one of our code share agreements with delta be terminated  and we likely would be unable to find an immediate source of revenue or earnings to offset such a loss 
we may be unable to enter into substitute code share arrangements  and any such arrangements we might secure may not be as favorable to us as our current agreements 
operating as an independent airline is a departure from our business strategy and would require considerable time and resources 
item a 
risk factors risks related to our code share agreements continued our code share agreements with delta and our other partners include various minimum operating performance requirements  which if we fail to meet  provide the partner with the ability to terminate the agreement with little or no notice requirement 
certain conditions that are beyond our control  such as weather  may negatively affect our performance such that we may fall below the minimum operating requirements 
for example  in june  delta gave notice to pinnacle that it intended to terminate pinnacle s crj dca  citing failure to meet on time performance requirements in the crj dca 
we disputed delta s right to terminate the crj dca  and we subsequently agreed with delta to continue operating under the crj dca 
although we were successful in this instance in keeping our crj dca intact with delta  a future attempt by delta or an attempt by another of our partners to terminate one of our code share agreements resulting from our failure to meet our minimum operating performance requirements would  if successful  have a material negative impact on our financial performance and liquidity 
we are also currently in discussion with delta to resolve certain significant disputed contractual matters  as discussed in note  code share agreements with partners  in item of this form k 
these unresolved disputes  or future disagreements over interpretation of our code share agreements  may result in materially unfavorable adjustments to our revenue and profitability related to our delta code share operations 
f 
we are highly dependent upon the services provided by our major airline partners 
we are highly dependent upon delta and continental  our capacity purchase agreements partners  for the services they provide to support our current operations 
for example  we currently use or rely upon delta s  continental s and to a lesser degree our pro rate partners systems  facilities and services to support a significant portion of our operations  including airport and terminal facilities and operations  information technology support  ticketing and reservations  scheduling  dispatching  fuel purchasing and ground handling services 
were we to lose any of our operations with these partners  particularly related to our crj dca and continental cpa agreements with delta and continental  respectively  for which we bear the ownership risks associated with the aircraft  we would need to replace all of the services mentioned above and make the other arrangements necessary to fly as an independent airline or otherwise find a suitable use for the aircraft 
g 
the rate based revenues we receive under our capacity purchase code share agreements may be less than the controllable costs we incur 
under our capacity purchase code share agreements with delta and continental  the major airline bears the risk related to the cost of certain reimbursable expenses that they are contractually required to repay in full to us 
with respect to other costs  often called rate based  our code share partner is obligated to pay to us amounts at predetermined rates based on the level of capacity that we generate for them 
if our controllable costs exceed our rate based revenue  our financial results will be adversely affected 
for example  certain crj maintenance expenses are intended to be covered by our rate based revenue 
as our crj fleet ages  the maintenance costs required to support the fleet are increasing  which places additional pressure on our profitability 
during the year ended december   approximately of our total costs were pass through costs and approximately of our costs were controllable costs related to our rate based revenue 
h 
our ability to operate profitably under colgan s pro rate code share agreements is heavily dependent on the price of aircraft fuel 
recent volatility in the price of fuel presents a market uncertainty and could have a significant negative impact on our operating results 
under our pro rate code share agreements  we bear the risk associated with fares  passenger demand  and competition within each market 
similarly  we also incur all of the costs associated with operating these flights  including those costs typically reimbursed or paid directly by the major airline under a capacity purchase agreement 
for example  colgan s pro rate agreements expose colgan to fuel price volatility 
in recent times  fuel prices have been extremely volatile  increasing by over or decreasing by over over a period of just a few months 
our ability to offset increases in the price of fuel by raising fares or surcharges may be limited  primarily because of reduced demand for air travel and competitiveness of the airline industry 
to the extent that we incur expenses that exceed the revenue we receive from passenger fares and incentive based revenue  our financial results will be negatively affected 
item a 
risk factors risks related to our code share agreements continued i 
we are at risk of adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving our aircraft 
while we believe the insurance we carry to cover losses arising from an aircraft crash or other accident is adequate to cover such losses  any accident involving an aircraft that we operate for one of our code share partners could create a public perception that our aircraft or operations are not safe or reliable 
such a perception could harm our reputation  result in the loss of existing business with our code share partners  result in an inability to win new business and harm our profitability 
for a description of the colgan flight accident in which all people aboard and an individual on the ground died  see legal proceedings in item of this form k 
j 
changes in government regulations imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 
airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements that involve significant compliance costs 
in the last several years  congress has passed laws  and the dot  faa and the tsa have issued regulations relating to the operation of airlines that have required significant expenditures 
we expect to continue to incur expenses in connection with complying with government regulations 
the faa is currently drafting new requirements  and depending on whether the final rules incorporate significant changes to crew rest requirements  our cost structure could be adversely affected 
we cannot predict the effect that these and other laws or regulations enacted in the future will have on our business 
risks related to our labor costs and collective bargaining agreements k 
increases in our labor costs  which constitute a substantial portion of our total operating costs  may directly affect our earnings 
labor costs are not directly reimbursed by any of our code share partners 
rather  compensation for these costs is intended to be covered by the payments based on pre set rates for block hours  departures and fixed costs 
labor costs constitute a significant portion  ranging from to  of our total operating costs 
pressure to increase these costs beyond standard industry wages  and therefore beyond the limits intended to be covered by the fixed payments we receive from our code share partners  is increased by the high degree of unionization of our workforce 
as of december   of our employees were unionized 
additionally  the new terms of a revised collective bargaining agreement with our pilots at pinnacle and a new collective bargaining agreement with our pilots at colgan will materially increase our salaries  wages and benefits costs 
pinnacle s pilots are currently paid at rates less than the industry average for similarly sized aircraft  and an amended collective bargaining agreement with alpa is expected to contain higher rates of pay for pinnacle s pilots 
in addition  while we have not offered retroactive compensation to pinnacle s pilots during the negotiation process  an amended collective bargaining agreement may contain a material signing bonus 
an increase in our labor costs over standard industry wages could result in a material reduction to our earnings  and could affect our future prospects for additional business opportunities 
l 
strikes or labor disputes with our employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could result in the termination  or a significant reduction of the benefit  of our code share agreements 
if we are unable to reach collective bargaining agreements upon their initial or amendable dates with any of our unionized work groups in accordance with the railway labor act  we may be subject to work interruptions  work stoppages  or a fleet size reduction 
work stoppages may adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations and fulfill our obligations under our code share agreements 
several of our code share agreements  including our continental cpa  our crj dca  and our crj asa  contain provisions granting our partners the right to terminate our agreements in the event of a work stoppage or labor strike 
additionally  our crj asa contains a provision allowing delta to reduce the size of our crj fleet in the event of a work stoppage or labor strike 
item a 
risk factors risks related to our labor costs and collective bargaining agreements continued our collective bargaining agreement with the air line pilots association  the union representing pinnacle s pilots  became amendable on april  in september  the pilots voted against the ratification of a tentative agreement to amend the collective bargaining agreement 
while our future negotiations with alpa will be conducted under the oversight of the national mediation board  as a result of their vote against the tentative agreement  we are unable to predict when an agreement could be reached 
consequently  we remain at risk of a strike by our pilots should the national mediation board release our pilots from the negotiations and should we fail to obtain an agreement with alpa before the parties are legally entitled to self help under the railway labor act 
m 
if we are unable to attract and retain key employees  our business could be harmed 
we compete against the other major and regional us airlines for pilots  mechanics and other employee groups essential for providing airlines services 
several of the other airlines offer wage and benefit packages that exceed ours 
we may be required to increase wages and or benefits in order to attract and retain qualified employees or risk considerable turnover  which could negatively affect our ability to provide a quality product to our customers and therefore negatively affect our relationship with our customers 
similarly  as we further expand our q operations for continental  our need for qualified pilots  mechanics and other airline specific employees increases 
for example  pinnacle s ongoing negotiation with alpa for an amended collective bargaining agreement may complicate our ability to both attract and retain pilots  one of our key employee groups 
if we are unable to hire  train and retain qualified pilots we would be unable to efficiently run our operations and our competitive ability would be impaired 
our business could be harmed and revenue reduced if  due to a shortage of pilots  we are forced to cancel flights and forego earning incentive based revenue under our code share agreements

partially offsetting these improvements was a decline in unit revenue in colgan s pro rate operations  and increased labor and maintenance costs throughout our operations 
our net income in is also substantially increased as a result of our settlement with the internal revenue service related to their review of our tax filings for   and we recorded a nonrecurring increase in net income of million from this settlement 
in addition to improvements in our operating and net income  we completed a number of transactions during to increase our liquidity in advance of the date that holders of our remaining outstanding senior convertible notes the notes could require us to repurchase them 
holders of the notes had an option on february  the put date to require us to repurchase the then outstanding notes for the par amount plus accrued interest 
because of this impending obligation in february  during we focused on increasing our liquidity and reducing the amount of the notes outstanding through secondary market repurchases 
during the third quarter of  we completed a million term loan collateralized by our spare rotable and expendable aircraft parts inventory and certain spare engines the spare parts loan 
in addition  we entered into a settlement agreement the ars settlement with the financial institution that sold us our portfolio of auction rate securities ars 
the ars settlement increased our cash balance by approximately million 
as a result of these transactions and positive operating cash flow of million during  we substantially increased our liquidity position 
we used this increase in liquidity to repurchase million par amount of the notes in the first quarter of and approximately million par amount of the notes during the third quarter of approximately million par amount of the notes remained outstanding as of december  in addition  we received a federal income tax refund in late february totaling approximately million related to our federal income tax return 
receipt of this refund further enhanced our liquidity position 
in january  we completed a million short term credit facility collateralized by our federal income tax receivable 
this facility was designed to increase our working capital until we received our tax refund 
we repaid the facility in late february upon receipt of our tax refund 
finally  in january  we modified a financial covenant to maintain a certain level of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents contained in our spare parts loan to lower the minimum requirement to million for the first quarter of for additional information regarding this minimum cash requirement test  please refer to note of our consolidated financial statements  which are contained in item of this form k 
as a result of these accomplishments  we had sufficient resources to repay the remaining outstanding million par amount of notes on the put date and meet our minimum cash requirement test 
as of february   and after repurchase of the notes  we had consolidated unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  and we believe our liquidity will be adequate to fund our operations and meet our financial covenants for the foreseeable future 
there are several open disputed contractual issues  primarily related to our crj asa  between delta and us 
some of these issues date back to  and we have been in discussions with delta since that time in an attempt to reach resolution 
the current status of each issue is discussed in greater detail below 
first  delta has challenged a one time adjustment to our block hour  cycle and fixed payment rates under our crj asa that was to become effective january  niether party has ever applied a rate increase or rate decrease related to this provision under the crj asa  and we have received payments from delta since as if there were no adjustment under this provision of the crj asa 
based on the objection notice we received from delta in  the impact of delta s assertion could be a cumulative adjustment of as much as million for through  and a rate decrease of approximately million annually until the next contractually scheduled rate adjustment on january  we believe the rate adjustment  were it applicable  would result in an increase in our rates 
the parties have agreed to arbitrate this dispute if we are unable to successfully resolve this matter through further negotiation 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook continued second  during  delta also disputed its obligation to fully reimburse us for aviation insurance premiums related to our delta connection operations 
during the second quarter of  delta requested that we exit the delta aviation insurance program and independently source our own aviation insurance 
effective july   we obtained our own independent insurance program at a cost significantly higher than what we were allocated by delta under the delta insurance program 
delta has asserted that it is not obligated to reimburse the full costs of aviation insurance obtained under our independent insurance program related to our delta connection operations 
since july  delta has failed to reimburse us for million of aviation insurance premiums related to our delta connection operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that we did not meet the accounting standards to recognize future unreimbursed insurance premiums as revenue until we reach conclusion of this matter with delta  and we did not recognize million of unreimbursed insurance costs 
we firmly believe that our operating agreements with delta require full reimbursement of our actual aviation insurance premiums related to delta connection operations  and we are evaluating our potential remedies related to this dispute 
we continue to discuss this matter with delta  and we believe that the parties will resolve this issue in the near future 
to the extent that we are unable to successfully resolve this matter through discussion  we may be forced to take legal action to protect our contractual rights under our agreements with delta 
additionally  during delta asserted that it may materially alter the payments related to the ground handling of our flights in the majority of the airports where we operate under our crj asa  resulting in a decrease in our annual operating income of approximately million subject to fluctuation based on changes in the level of our operations and the cities where we fly under the crj asa 
in august  delta began to apply its interpretation of ground handling to the monthly payments that pinnacle received  resulting in a net reduction of payments to pinnacle of approximately million for august through december in addition  delta asserted that pinnacle owed delta a retroactive payment related to this ground handling issue of approximately million 
in early  in connection with the tentative settlement of several items  we tentatively agreed to accept delta s treatment of ground handling costs without any retroactive application prior to august  we expect this change to reduce our operating income by approximately million in in connection with the resolution of our ground handling dispute  we also tentatively agreed to stipulate the amount owed to delta under a provision of the crj asa associated with the sharing of pinnacle s overhead upon the establishment of a certain level of operations outside of the crj asa 
under our tentative agreement  delta will receive a rate reduction of million for and million for  and million for to satisfy this provision 
the parties also tentatively settled an outstanding dispute related to the change in aircraft livery of pinnacle s crj fleet by delta agreeing to reimburse us for these costs 
finally  as part of the tentative agreement  delta agreed to modify the payment terms of some of our airport related costs under certain circumstances  which will provide us some limited protection in the event that delta asks us to operate in different markets in the future 
these matters  as well as resolution of our ground handling issue noted above  are subject to the execution of a binding written agreement  which the parties are in the process of preparing  however  no assurances can be given that additional modification to these and other arrangements will not occur in order to settle these matters with delta 
our pro rate operations  which account for approximately of our consolidated revenue  are susceptible to changes in passenger demand and fuel price volatility 
we took a number of steps during late and early to eliminate unprofitable markets  reduce costs  and increase revenue in our remaining pro rate markets 
these steps and lower fuel prices have returned our pro rate operations to profitability during however  the airline industry is experiencing the effects of the current recessionary environment in the united states 
industry passenger revenue declined dramatically during  and our pro rate operations were negatively affected by this drop 
while industry analysts forecast a recovery in passenger demand during  we cannot predict whether there will be an increase in fares associated with our pro rate operations in in addition  in connection with the us airways announcement of proposed reductions in service at laguardia  we discontinued our pro rate operations at laguardia in early january  reducing our operations under our us airways agreement by four aircraft 
we are currently evaluating other markets and may enter new markets later in if we do not identify profitable replacement markets for these aircraft  then our pro rate revenue and profitability in will be materially affected by this reduction 
further  our pro rate operations are still susceptible to seasonal demand fluctuations  with passenger demand materially weaker during the fourth and first quarter of each year as compared to the seasonally high demand we typically experience in the second and third quarters of each year 
similar to prior years  we do not expect to earn a significant amount of operating income from our pro rate operations during the first quarter of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook continued during the fourth quarter of  we relocated colgan s headquarters from manassas  virginia to memphis  tennessee 
we believe that relocating colgan s leadership team and system operations control center to our corporate headquarters will enhance the financial and operational performance of colgan long term due to a lower cost of living and the sharing of operational and safety best practices between pinnacle and colgan 
in addition  we are negotiating with state and local authorities to obtain certain long term incentives that will help offset the cost of relocating colgan s headquarters 
we incurred approximately million of costs associated with this move during  and expect to incur additional costs of approximately million during the first quarter of pinnacle has been involved in negotiations with the air line pilots association alpa since april  when the collective bargaining agreement between the two parties became amendable 
on august   pinnacle and alpa reached a tentative agreement to amend the collective bargaining agreement 
however  pinnacle s pilots did not ratify the tentative agreement 
the national mediation board now controls the timing of further negotiations with alpa  and we do not yet have information as to when further negotiations will take place 
the failed tentative agreement provided for an increase in compensation for pinnacle s pilots to the industry average  which is consistent with our company wide philosophy of industry average pay and benefits 
in addition  the failed tentative agreement called for a one time signing bonus of approximately million 
while we cannot predict what the terms of a new tentative agreement will contain  we do expect any new tentative agreement to substantially increase pinnacle s salaries  wages and benefits costs 
colgan s pilots also elected representation by alpa in late  and we recently began negotiations with alpa 
it is too early in the negotiation process for us to predict the timing or impact of a new collective bargaining agreement with alpa covering colgan s pilots 
throughout we have been positioning ourselves for additional profitable growth opportunities in and beyond 
in early we agreed with continental to expand our continental cpa by acquiring q aircraft from august through april we also acquired an additional q options from the aircraft manufacturer  thereby increasing the total remaining number of our q options to these options  if exercised  provide for the delivery of qs in and the remaining in the q aircraft has become a very competitive product within the regional airline industry 
the purchase price of the q is significantly less than that of comparably sized regional jets  and the q uses up to less fuel 
as a result  we can offer our airline partners a large  passenger friendly regional aircraft with a lower operating cost than that of similarly sized regional jets 
in addition to growing colgan with the q aircraft  we are positioning ourselves to capitalize on long term opportunities to increase the number of regional jets that we operate at pinnacle 
capacity purchase agreements for over seat regional jet aircraft at our competitors are set to expire between now and while many of these regional jets will likely no longer operate within the networks of the major us airlines  we believe some of these contracts will be renewed or offered to other regional airlines and some will be replaced with larger regional jets 
we intend to actively compete to obtain profitable regional jet flying during this period of transition within the industry  and we believe our history of strong operating performance with a competitive cost structure will position us to succeed 
our capacity purchase contracts do not begin to expire until december item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following represents our results of operations  by segment and consolidated  for the year ended december  a discussion of our results of operations as compared to the same periods in and follows

these items cumulatively reduced operating income by million for the year ended december  during  we recorded a net nonoperating gain of million million net of tax primarily related to the sale of our auction rate securities ars portfolio 
our net income for also includes net nonoperating gains of million associated with the repurchase of certain indebtedness in the first quarter of and hedge losses associated with one q aircraft that was destroyed 
our net income for the year ended december  was also increased by million related to our settlement with the internal revenue service on its examination of our federal tax returns for the tax years through item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated and segmented results of operations continued during  we recorded charges of million million net of tax related to the impairment of colgan s goodwill and certain charges necessary to retire several of colgan s aircraft associated with its pro rate operations 
in addition  during  we recorded an impairment charge of million million net of tax to write down the value of our portfolio of auction rate securities to fair value 
operating revenues operating revenue of million for the year ended december  decreased million  or  compared to changes in our capacity purchase related operating revenue are primarily caused by changes in our operating fleet size and aircraft utilization 
changes in our pro rate related operating revenue are primarily caused by a reduction in the scope of our pro rate operations that we undertook in the fall of  and by changes in the average load factor  average passenger fare  and average incentive payments we receive from our partners and under our essential air service agreements 
these changes are discussed in greater detail within our segmented results of operations 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased by million  or  as compared to  primarily due to the decrease in fuel expense and gallons consumed at our colgan subsidiary  along with the impairment of colgan s goodwill and other intangible assets during this change and others are discussed in greater detail within our segmented results of operations 
nonoperating expense net nonoperating expense of million for the year ended december  decreased by approximately million as compared to the decrease is primarily related to the previously discussed million net investment gain  as compared to the million ars impairment charge recorded during interest expense increased slightly  primarily related to the addition of crj and q aircraft to our fleet throughout  offset by the reversal of interest on tax reserves  as previously discussed  and by a reduction in interest expense on our senior convertible notes as a result of the repurchase and retirement of the majority of those obligations during the overall decrease was offset by a decrease in interest income of million due to the decrease in interest rates on our ars portfolio  as well as the sale of our ars portfolio in august income tax expense for the year ended december   we recorded income tax expense of million 
as previously discussed  we recently reached settlement with the irs regarding our examination for tax years through the irs had proposed a number of adjustments to our returns totaling approximately million of additional tax  plus accrued interest and penalties on these proposed adjustments 
we agreed to pay approximately million of additional income tax and accrued interest in settlement of all open tax matters for the years examined 
as a result  we recorded a reduction to income tax expense of million to reduce our accrued income tax reserves pursuant to the settlement 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated and segmented results of operations continued compared to operating revenue operating revenue of million for the year ended december  increased million  or  over the year ended december  this increase was primarily related to an increase in our capacity purchase revenue 
during  we added q aircraft and crj aircraft  including seven crj aircraft owned by delta and operated by us on a temporary basis  to our operating fleet 
this was partially offset by a decrease in the average number of crj aircraft we operate under our crj asa 
our pro rate revenue increased slightly as a result of a increase in average fare  offset by an decrease in passengers 
these changes are discussed in greater detail within our segmented results of operations 
operating expenses operating expenses increased by million  or  during the year ended december   primarily due to increases in block hours and departures associated with the growth in our operating fleet 
in addition  operating expenses increased as a result of increased fuel prices related to our pro rate operations  increased depreciation expense following the addition of our recently purchased crj and q aircraft  increased unreimbursed maintenance costs incurred on our aging crj fleet  impairment charges primarily related to colgan s goodwill  colgan s lease return costs  and increased compensation expense resulting from the addition of employees to support the growth of our business 
these changes are discussed in greater detail within our segmented results of operations 
nonoperating expense net nonoperating expense of million for the year ended december  increased by approximately million over net nonoperating expense of million during this increase is attributable to the million increase in interest expense  primarily related to the financing of the crj and q aircraft  the majority of which were delivered and financed during interest income decreased by million  due to a lower average invested balance throughout as compared to in addition  we recorded a million impairment charge related to the decline in the fair values of our ars portfolio 
net nonoperating expense for the year ended december  was affected by a million loss related to the sale of our remaining northwest unsecured claim 
income tax expense for the year ended december   our income tax expense decreased by million  primarily related to the decrease in pre tax income as compared to partially offsetting the decline of income tax expense is the valuation allowance we recorded against the tax benefit related to the million ars impairment charge 
this valuation allowance was recorded because the loss cannot offset ordinary income  and we expect no capital gains during the carryforward period of this loss

delta asserted that it has the right under the crj asa to reduce both the revenue we receive and the cost we pay for ground handling services in certain cities where delta or its designee provides ground handling services to us 
during  delta began to compensate us according to its interpretation of the crj asa 
as a result  the revenue we received for the year ended december   related to certain ground handling services was reduced by approximately million  and our related ground handling costs were reduced by million  with the resulting net effect of a reduction of operating income of approximately million 
lastly  a change in other reimbursable expenses caused revenue to increase by million  for the year ended december   as compared to pursuant to the terms of our crj asa with delta  we are reimbursed with margin for certain operational costs 
these costs include certain maintenance costs  aircraft rentals  passenger liability and hull insurance  property taxes  fuel  ground handling at crj asa service cities  and landing fees at detroit metropolitan wayne county airport dtw 
to the extent that these reimbursable costs increase or decline  we experience a corresponding increase or decline in revenue 
revenue from reimbursable expenses increased by million related to heavy maintenance checks  million related to increased deicing expense  million related to increased insurance expenses  and million related to other maintenance expense 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million related to reduced property taxes  million related to reduced engine maintenance expense  and million related to reduced aircraft rental expense

our reimbursable expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  causing decreases in revenue of 
partially offsetting this decrease is a increase in crj asa revenue for the year ended december  related to the annual inflation index adjustment in our crj block hour and departure asa rates 
revenue earned under our crj dca was approximately million for the year ended december  as of december   we operated crj aircraft under our crj dca  seven of which were operated on a short term basis until the company s seven remaining permanent aircraft entered service

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated and segmented results of operations continued other revenue other revenue decreased million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to this decrease is primarily related to a decrease in the amount of ground handling we provided to third party vendors  including northwest  during pinnacle operating expenses years ended december  change change operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits aircraft rentals ground handling services aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs other rentals and landing fees commissions and passenger related expense depreciation and amortization other total operating expenses operating income operating margin pts 
pts 
compared to salaries  wages and benefits increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to this increase is largely attributable to rising health care and insurance costs  which increased approximately million in  as compared to wages increased slightly  as wage rates increased for existing employees  while headcount decreased  primarily related to reductions in ground handling personnel in stations where we performed our own ground handling functions under the crj asa 
the reduction in ground handling personnel occurred as a result of delta reassigning ground handling functions to itself or its designees 
wage rate increases were also offset by a million reduction in the matching contribution of pinnacle s non pilot k plan 
during  the matching contribution was temporarily suspended 
aircraft rental expense decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to this decrease relates to a decrease of in the average number of crj aircraft  which are leased from delta  operated during as compared to as previously discussed  aircraft rentals are reimbursable expenses under our crj asa  and as a result of the fewer average number of crj aircraft in our fleet  revenue under our crj asa decreased by million for the year ended december  ground handling services decreased by million  or  during the year ended december   as compared to although this change is nominal  there were large changes in the mix of reimbursed and unreimbursed ground handling expense 
these changes caused significant decreases in regional airlines services revenue 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated and segmented results of operations continued aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to this increase is attributable to additional maintenance related to the aging of our crj fleet as the majority of our crj aircraft are no longer covered under warranty 
we are also incurring additional maintenance expense on our crj fleet for specific maintenance programs and upgrades recommended by the manufacturer associated with engine fan blade replacement and adjustments to the motor controlling deployment of the wing flaps 
commissions and passenger related expense decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to this is primarily related to the decrease in the number of airport locations we staff under our crj asa 
as a result  we do not incur the same level of passenger related expenses  as these costs are included in the ground handing rates that we pay delta or its designated ground handler 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this is primarily related to depreciation on our fleet of crj aircraft  the majority of which were added to our fleet throughout other expense decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to effective july   we are no longer participating in delta s insurance program 
the rates for our new coverage are significantly higher than those of our previous coverage  which caused an increase in insurance expense of million 
these insurance costs are reimbursed with margin by delta 
offsetting this increase is a decrease in other expenses primarily related to decreases in costs related to crew training and other crew related expenses 
as previously discussed  we are experiencing low levels of attrition within our flight crews and are not currently hiring or training new crew members and as a result  flight crew related costs and training decreased by million for the year ended december  in addition  property tax expense decreased by million due to a reduced assessment in the state of tennessee 
property tax is also reimbursed with margin by delta 
the remainder of the decrease is attributable to the fleet expansion expenses we incurred in as we were bringing the crj operations online  a decrease in professional services costs related to our new systems implementation project in  and a decrease in station related costs as several stations formerly operated by pinnacle are now operated by delta or its designees 
compared to salaries  wages and benefits increased by million and for the year ended december   as compared to these increases were due primarily to the increase in the average number of employees  coupled with wage rate and benefit increases for existing employees 
the increase in the number of employees is related to our planned increases to support our new crj dca operations 
additionally  due to a significant decline in pilot attrition in  we experienced an accumulation of additional flight crews above the target level necessary for our operations 
because our agreements with flight crew employees include a guaranteed minimum number of paid hours  we have experienced a decline in pilot and flight attendant productivity as we pay salaries and wages in excess of the actual hours worked such that those employees are paid the guaranteed minimum 
to address the accumulation of excess flight crews  we have suspended our recruiting efforts until attrition allows our staff levels to return to target levels 
also contributing to an increase in salaries  wages and benefits is a million  or  increase in our health insurance costs as a result of an increase in average employee claims 
aircraft rentals expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december  as compared to this decrease from to relates primarily to the fewer average number of crj aircraft  which are leased from delta 
as previously discussed  aircraft rentals are reimbursable expenses under our crj asa  and as a result of the fewer average number of crj aircraft in our fleet  revenue under our crj asa decreased by million for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated and segmented results of operations continued ground handling services decreased million  or  during the year ended december  as compared to ground handling expenses decreased by million  or  due to the decrease in crj departures 
offsetting this decrease is a million increase in deicing expense primarily related to severe weather during under our crj asa  deicing expenses are reimbursable costs  and as such  increased our crj asa revenue by million for the year ended december  aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expenses increased by million and for the year ended december  as compared to underlying this small change are more significant changes in the mix of reimbursed and unreimbursed maintenance costs on the crj aircraft 
to the extent that we experience an increase in unreimbursed maintenance costs  we receive no additional revenue to offset the increases 
for the year ended december   reimbursable maintenance expenses decreased by million  whereas non reimbursable maintenance expenses increased by million 
the million reduction in reimbursed expenses results in a corresponding million decline in our crj asa revenue as we also earn margin on the expenses 
these non reimbursable increases are attributable to additional maintenance related to the aging of our crj fleet 
other rentals and landing fees increased million  or  during the year ended december  as compared to these increases primarily relate to rate increases for landing fees in certain markets  the most significant increase being at dtw  which increased million 
pursuant to the terms of our crj asa with delta  dtw landings fees are reimbursable under our crj asa  and thus caused increases of million in revenue under our crj asa for the year ended december  the additional increase is related to landing fees associated with our crj dca operations 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million for the year ended december  this is primarily related to million of depreciation on crj aircraft added during other expense increased by million  or  for the year ended december  this increase primarily relates to increased pilot training and crew travel expenses related to our new operations with delta

net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december  this included a federal income tax refund of approximately million that we received on april  we do not anticipate making federal income tax payments in due to the accelerated depreciation recognized for tax purposes related to our newly acquired crj and q aircraft  and we received a federal tax refund of approximately million in late february related to the tax year 
contractual obligations 
the following chart details our debt and lease obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period thereafter total senior convertible notes debt interest payments on debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations during  we repurchased  par amount of our  senior convertible notes due the remaining notes were repurchased in february as of february   no par amount of notes remain outstanding 
the amounts noted above for operating leases include  of obligations for crj aircraft leased from delta 
we are reimbursed by delta in full for crj aircraft rental expense under the crj asa 
for a more detailed discussion of operating leases  refer to note in item of this form k 
the table above excludes an approximate million accident liability related to flight  recorded in other liabilities  as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  in item of this form k 
this liability is offset in its entirety by a receivable  recorded in other assets  which the company expects to receive from insurance carriers as claims are resolved 
on january   we entered into a short term loan agreement with a bank for million the bridge loan 
the bridge loan was secured by our federal income tax refund and had an effective interest rate of  and matures on april  the bridge loan was designed to temporarily provide us with additional working capital until we received our federal income tax refund 
we repaid the bridge loan in full upon receipt of our federal income tax refund in late february in august  we entered into a purchase and release agreement the ars settlement agreement with the financial institution that originally sold us the ars portfolio 
pursuant to the terms of the ars settlement agreement  the institution purchased our ars portfolio at a discount to par plus accrued interest 
in addition  the institution granted us three year options to repurchase all or a portion of the ars from the institution at the same discount to par that the institution paid to us under the ars settlement agreement the ars call options 
we used the majority of the proceeds to repay a margin loan facility that the institution had previously provided to us in response to the failure of the ars market the credit facility 
after repayment of the credit facility  we received approximately million from the ars settlement 
our ars call options were valued at million at december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources continued in july  we completed a three year term loan financing for million the spare parts loan 
the spare parts loan is secured by our pool of spare repairable  rotable and expendable parts and certain aircraft engines 
the interest rate for the spare parts loan is a variable rate  which is indexed to libor subject to a floor and was as of december  the spare parts loan requires that we maintain a minimum liquidity level at the end of every month and at specified times preceding the maturity date or call date of certain other indebtedness 
the spare parts loan also has standard provisions relating to our obligation to timely repay the indebtedness and maintenance of the collateral base relative to the outstanding principal amount of the borrowing 
on january   we amended the spare parts loan to reduce the required minimum liquidity level on four specific dates during the first quarter of amounts outstanding under the spare parts loan were million as of december  in february  we issued million principal amount of our senior convertible notes due the notes bear interest at the rate of per year  payable in cash semiannually in arrears on february and august of each year 
the notes are convertible into a combination of cash and common stock at a conversion price of approximately 
the notes are convertible in any quarter subsequent to a quarter in which the closing price of our common stock exceeds for of the last trading days 
this condition was not met during the year ended december   and consequently the notes were not convertible by the holders during or the first quarter of while they were still outstanding 
on february   the holders of the notes exercised their option to require us to purchase all of the remaining outstanding notes for cash at a purchase price equal to of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
as a result  the entire remaining carrying amount of the notes is classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  on february   we repurchased the remaining outstanding notes 
in february  we entered into a purchase agreement for up to firm and option q aircraft with bombardier  inc under the agreement  we were obligated to purchase a minimum of q regional aircraft  which we satisfied during in january  we modified the purchase agreement to exercise our right to purchase the remaining ten firm q aircraft and five of the option q aircraft  which will be delivered between august and april we also secured additional options to acquire q aircraft that would be delivered in upon completion of this amendment  we now have optional rights to acquire a total of q aircraft  of which would deliver in and of which would deliver in in april  delta assigned to us its rights to purchase crj aircraft from bombardier  inc as of december   we had accepted delivery of all of these aircraft 
under the crj dca  delta has the right to require us to purchase and operate an additional seven crj aircraft 
we are required to make pre delivery payments to bombardier for the firm q aircraft that we have on order 
these payments began in january and will continue through october approximately of the remaining pre delivery payments to be made in will be financed under a pre delivery payment financing facility provided by export development canada edc 
the remaining or approximately million will be funded through our internal capital resources 
this unfinanced portion of our pre delivery payment requirements is scheduled to be paid in the second quarter of the interest rate associated with this pre delivery payment facility is indexed to libor  and was as of december  the outstanding balance of these borrowings as of december  was million 
as each aircraft is delivered to us  we repay the associated borrowings 
upon delivery of our crj and q aircraft  we obtained long term financing  ranging from to years  for of the aircraft purchase price  the balance of which was million at december  we have also obtained a commitment from edc to finance of the purchase price of the q aircraft on order upon the delivery of each aircraft 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources continued additionally  during  we reached a settlement agreement with the internal revenue service the service concerning their examination of our federal income tax returns for   and the service had initially proposed a number of adjustments to the company s returns totaling approximately million of additional tax  plus accrued interest and penalties on these proposed adjustments 
we agreed to pay approximately million of additional income tax and accrued interest in settlement of all open tax matters for these years 
we paid this settlement amount during the second quarter of with this agreement  the service completed its examination of our federal tax filings for  and operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  this is primarily attributable to the approximately million tax refund we received in april  and due to approximately million in cash generated from our operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  this was due primarily to the million in hedge related payments made during  offset by cash primarily generated from regional airline service operations of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  this was due primarily to the approximately million of proceeds received from the assignment of our northwest claims 
in january  we assigned an aggregate of approximately million of our million stipulated unsecured claim against northwest to several third parties for aggregate proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses 
in june  we assigned the remaining million of our claim for proceeds of million 
the majority of these claim proceeds were recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
our claim assignment proceeds were offset by income tax payments associated with the claim assignments of million 
in addition  our recurring airlines operations provided operating cash flow of approximately million 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
this was primarily attributable to proceeds received from certain ars redemptions at par by the issuers  proceeds from the ars settlement  and net proceeds from exercises of a portion of the ars call options totaling million 
in addition  we received net insurance proceeds of million 
these amounts were offset by million in cash purchases of property and equipment 
we expect non aircraft cash capital expenditures for to be approximately to million 
we expect to fund the non aircraft capital expenditures with existing cash resources and cash flows generated from our operations 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
this was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the sale of ars of million  offset by million in net cash purchases of property and equipment  primarily consisting of flight equipment 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
this was primarily attributable to net purchases of short term investments in marketable debt securities of million  million in pre delivery payments for the q and crj aircraft and net purchases of property and equipment of million  primarily consisting of the unfinanced portion of aircraft purchases 
in addition  the acquisition of colgan decreased cash by million  net of cash acquired 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
this was primarily related to million used to repurchase a portion of the company s notes  million repaid on credit facilities and million of principal payments on other debt obligations 
these debt payments were offset by the million proceeds received related to the spare parts loan 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
during  we received million in debt proceeds  primarily related to the million credit facility 
this was offset by million of principal payments on debt obligations  million used to repurchase our series a preferred shares from northwest  and million used in other financing activities 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources continued cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
during  we received million in debt proceeds  primarily related to the pre delivery payment financing facilities for our q and crj aircraft 
this was offset by million of principal payments on debt obligations 
in addition  we purchased million of treasury shares as part of our share repurchase program 
guarantees and indemnifications 
we had million and million invested in demand deposit accounts and in other similar instruments at december  and  respectively 
these deposit accounts are used as collateral for standby letter of credit facilities that we maintain for various vendors 
as of december  and  we had million and million of standby letters of credit outstanding  respectively 
we are party to numerous contracts and real estate leases in which it is common for us to agree to indemnify third parties for tort liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the contract or occupancy of the leased premises 
in some cases  this indemnity extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties  but usually excludes any liabilities caused by their gross negligence or willful misconduct 
additionally  we typically indemnify the lessors and related third parties for any environmental liability that arises out of or relates to our leased premises 
in our aircraft lease agreements  we typically indemnify the prime lessor  financing parties  trustees acting on their behalf and other related parties against liabilities that arise from the manufacture  design  ownership  financing  use  operation and maintenance of the aircraft and for tort liability  whether or not these liabilities arise out of or relate to the negligence of these indemnified parties  except for their gross negligence or willful misconduct 
we expect that we would be covered by insurance subject to deductibles for most tort liabilities and related indemnities described above with respect to real estate we lease and aircraft we operate 
we do not expect the potential amount of future payments under the foregoing indemnities and agreements to be material 
off balance sheet arrangements 
none of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
we are responsible for all maintenance  insurance and other costs associated with these leased assets  however  the lease agreements do not include a residual value guarantee  fixed price purchase option or other similar guarantees 
we have no other material off balance sheet arrangements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant accounting policies and critical estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the sec has defined critical accounting policies as those policies that are most important to the preparation of financial statements and require management s subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition nature of estimates required passenger and ground handling revenues are recognized when service is provided 
under our contract and pro rate flying agreements with our code share partners  revenue is considered earned when the flight is completed 
additionally  our operating agreements include the ability to earn incentive revenue 
the calculation of these revenues involves the use of estimates that can be subject to differing analysis of the related operating metrics or interpretation of the related contractual provisions 
in some instances  uncertainty exists as to the party responsible for causing a negative effect on the relevant operating metric 
our revenues could be affected by several factors  including changes to the code share agreements  contract modifications resulting from contract renegotiations and our ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements 
also  in the event we have a reimbursement dispute with a major partner at a quarterly or annual financial statement date due to matters such as differing interpretations of the underlying operating agreement  we evaluate the dispute under our established revenue recognition criteria and  provided the revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize revenue for that period based on our estimate of the resolution of the dispute 
accordingly  we are required to exercise judgment and use assumptions in the application of our revenue recognition policy 
assumptions and approach used our operating revenues are calculated based on our interpretation of the underlying code share agreements and our analysis of the related operating metrics 
effect if different assumptions used while in practice these kinds of discrepancies are typically quickly resolved with our partners usually within the following month  should our interpretation of the agreement or analysis of the relevant operating metrics differ materially from those of our code share partners and our interpretations fail to prevail  our revenue could be materially understated or overstated 
for example and as previously discussed in the overview portion of this item  we are currently in discussions with delta regarding certain disputed contractual items in both our asa and dca 
one of these issues  for example  includes delta s challenge to our interpretation of a one time adjustment to our block hour  cycle and fixed payment rates that was to become effective january  based on the objection notice we received from delta in  the impact of delta s assertion could be a cumulative adjustment of as much as million from through  and a rate decrease of approximately million annually until the next contractually scheduled rate adjustment on january  fair value of investments nature of estimates required our investment portfolio previously consisted primarily of ars 
during  we reached an agreement to sell our portfolio of ars to the financial institution that had originally sold the ars to us 
the ars settlement provides that for a period of three years from the date of the ars settlement  we shall have the right to repurchase all or a portion of the ars at the same discount to par the bank paid to us under the ars settlement 
we determined the fair value of the ars call options to be million at december  the ars call options are classified as investments on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  as described in note of item of this form k  we have categorized the fair value for these assets as level financial instruments  which are those with little to no observable inputs or market data  which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions to use in the determination of fair value 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant accounting policies and critical estimates continued assumptions and approach used we determined the fair value of our ars call options utilizing the assistance of a third party valuation specialist 
for each of our ars call options  a discounted cash flow dcf analysis was prepared to determine the estimated fair value as of december  the model considered potential changes in yields for securities with similar characteristics to the underlying ars and evaluated possible future refinancing opportunities for the issuers of the ars 
the likelihood of future refinancing opportunities was determined based upon a comparison of projected rates to be paid by issuers assuming auctions continue to fail versus projected rates under various refinancing scenarios  based upon different assumptions about the path of future interest rates 
the analysis then assessed the likelihood that the options would be exercisable as a result of the underlying ars being redeemed or traded in a secondary market at an amount greater than the exercise price prior to the end of the option term 
based on the results of this assessment  we record any change in the fair values of the ars call options as a mark to market adjustment in the statement of operations 
effect if different assumptions used had we used different dcf assumptions  particularly with respect to the projected path of future yields on the underlying ars portfolio or similar securities  the value of the ars call options could have been materially different than the value recorded at year end 
goodwill and other long lived assets goodwill nature of estimates required we perform an impairment test of our pinnacle reporting unit on an annual basis and  if certain events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss may have been incurred  on an interim basis 
the scheduled annual impairment test date for our goodwill is october factors considered important when determining the impairment of goodwill include items affecting the cash flows of the reporting segment  significant changes in the underlying business strategy or operational environment  material ongoing industry or economic trends  or other factors 
any changes in the key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities could result in an impairment charge 
at october   we performed the annual required impairment test of our goodwill 
the test resulted in no impairment charge 
assumptions and approach used our cash flow estimates are based on our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
our determination of a reporting unit s fair value is based upon our perspective of industry trends  market rates and market transactions 
other assumptions include the appropriate discount rate  which represents our weighted average cost of capital 
factors indicating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of our common stock and declines in our current or projected future net income 
effect if different assumptions used if the results of these evaluations determined that impairment has occurred  an impairment charge could affect earnings by as much as the carrying value 
as of december   we had approximately million in goodwill 
if the current economic market conditions further decline and if there is a prolonged period of weakness in the business environment and airline sector  our businesses may be adversely affected  which could result in future impairment of our goodwill 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant accounting policies and critical estimates continued long lived assets nature of estimates required our long lived assets consist of property and equipment and intangible assets 
approximately of our total assets are invested in property and equipment  which will continue to increase as we acquire additional aircraft to support our capacity purchase agreements with continental 
we capitalize only those costs that meet the definition of capital assets under accounting standards 
accordingly  repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset or are not part of the cost of acquiring the asset are expensed as incurred 
the depreciation of our property and equipment over their estimated useful lives and the determination of any salvage values requires management to make judgments about future events 
assumptions and approach used in accounting for long lived assets including intangible assets with definite lives  we must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
because we utilize most of our property and equipment over relatively long periods  we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset 
in addition to considering our planned use of long lived assets  when necessary  such as when making estimates related to our new aircraft for which there is little historical data available  we engage airline industry specialists to assist with the determination of relevant estimates 
when appropriate  we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset s  a significant change in the long lived asset s physical condition  and cash flows associated with the use of the long lived asset 
the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value 
when considering whether or not impairment of long lived assets exists  we group similar assets together at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and compare the undiscounted cash flows for the entire group of assets to the carrying value of the same group of assets 
asset groupings are typically done at the fleet or contract level 
we have not experienced any significant impairment of assets to be held and used 
however  from time to time we make decisions to remove certain long lived assets from service based on projections of reduced capacity needs  and those decisions may result in an impairment charge 
there were no material asset impairment charges recognized in  or effect if different assumptions used periodic re evaluations  which can be significant  could be caused by changes to our maintenance program  changes in the utilization of the aircraft  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used similar aircraft 
generally  these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense  as required by accounting standards and  ultimately  the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
any impairment charge could affect earnings by as much as the carrying values of the assets 
spare parts and supplies nature of estimates required inventories  expendable parts and maintenance supplies relating to flight equipment are carried at cost and are expensed when the inventory is used 
a fleet retirement reserve is provided over the remaining estimated useful life of the related aircraft equipment  for spare parts expected to be on hand at the date the aircraft are retired from service  plus allowances for spare parts currently identified as obsolete or excess 
we will continue to modify these estimates as our fleet ages 
the adequacy of our fleet retirement reserve requires a high degree of judgment 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant accounting policies and critical estimates continued assumptions and approach used our fleet retirement reserve related to inventory is provided over the remaining useful life of the related aircraft  plus allowance for spare parts currently identified as excess 
part of the calculation for this reserve is based on historical experience 
in addition  we may reserve for additional amounts when we deem parts as excess inventory 
effect if different assumptions used as of december   our fleet retirement reserve related to our spare parts and supplies was approximately million 
if we increase the reserve by  the impact on pre tax income is immaterial 
in addition to the estimates discussed above  we have made certain other estimates that  while not involving the same degree of judgment  are important to understanding our financial statements 
we continually evaluate our accounting policies and the estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
our estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect our best judgment after giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
management has discussed the development of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented above relating to them 
for more information  see note in item of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk because the majority of our contracts are capacity purchase agreements  our exposure to market risks such as commodity price risk eg  aircraft fuel prices is primarily limited to our pro rate operations  which comprise of our consolidated revenues 
with our acquisition of colgan and our contracts with delta and continental that include the purchase of aircraft  we are exposed to commodity price and interest rate risks as discussed below 
commodity price risk our pro rate operations include exposure to certain market risks primarily related to aircraft fuel  which recently has been extremely volatile 
aviation fuel expense is a significant expense for any air carrier  and even marginal changes in the cost of fuel greatly affect a carrier s profitability 
standard industry contracts do not generally provide protection against fuel price increases  nor do they ensure availability of supply 
while our capacity purchase agreements require that fuel be provided to us at no cost  thereby reducing our overall exposure to fuel price fluctuations  our pro rate code share agreements with continental  us airways  and united expose us to fuel price risk 
slightly offsetting our fuel risk  our agreement with continental provides for an adjustment to the pro rate revenue we receive from continental based on projected changes in fuel prices 
for the projected annualized fuel consumption related to these agreements  each ten percent change in the price of jet fuel amounts to an approximate million change in annual fuel costs 
interest rate risk aircraft financing 
we are exposed to interest rate risk from the time of entering into purchase commitments until the delivery of aircraft  at which time we receive permanent  fixed rate financing for each aircraft 
in january  we entered into a purchase agreement for firm q aircraft with bombardier  which will be delivered between august and april should interest rates change by basis points before we take delivery  and assuming that we do not hedge the anticipated debt on the remaining q aircraft  aggregate interest expense in the first year of financing would change by approximately million 
investment income 
our earnings are affected by fluctuations in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on the amount of interest income we earn from our investments  which primarily consist of taxable money market securities 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments to protect against the effects of changes in interest rates on our interest income 
based on our current balance of taxable money market securities  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in annual investment income of approximately million
