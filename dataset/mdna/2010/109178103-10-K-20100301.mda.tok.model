b the standardized measure for our proved reserves at december   was million 
see reconciliation of standardized measure to pre tax pv for a definition of pre tax pv and a reconciliation of our standardized measure to our pre tax pv value 
the prices used to calculate this measure were per barrel of oil and per mmbtu of natural gas 
these prices represent the average prices per barrel of oil and per mmbtu of natural gas at the beginning of each month in the month period prior to the end of the reporting period 
these prices were adjusted to reflect applicable transportation and quality differentials on a well by well basis to arrive at realized sales prices used to estimate our reserves at this date 
c boe is defined as one barrel of oil equivalent determined using the ratio of six mcf of natural gas to one bbl of crude oil  condensate or natural gas liquids 
d average daily production volumes calculated based on day year 
includes approximately  barrels of oil produced in the williston basin during and recorded as inventory at year end ending inventory at year end and was not material 
adjusting the production volumes for amounts included in inventory would result in average daily sales volumes in the rocky mountains and in total of  and  barrels of oil equivalent  respectively 
rocky mountains province we regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our activities to areas that may offer attractive exploration and development potential 
in late  we began accumulating acreage in the williston basin located in north dakota and montana and in early entered into a joint venture agreement in the powder river basin located in wyoming 
during  we invested approximately million in drilling  land and seismic in the williston basin 
during  we spud gross wells in the williston basin  with wells completing and three wells drilling at year end 
in  we did not allocate any capital spending to the powder river basin 
overview of williston basin the williston basin is spread across north dakota  montana and parts of southern canada with the united states portion of the basin encompassing approximately  square miles 
the basin produces oil and gas from numerous producing horizons including  but not limited to  the bakken  three forks and red river formations  which are currently our primary objectives 

table of contents the bakken is an unconventional oil shale play at depths of approximately  to  feet that is primarily exploited via horizontal drilling and advanced completion techniques 
advanced completion techniques include the use of swell packers and multi stage fracture stimulations  which help to fracture the shales and increase oil flow to the well bore 
to date  much of the bakken drilling in north dakota has occurred east of the nesson anticline in and around mountrail county  with additional activity south of the nesson anticline in dunn county 
in the second half of  activity accelerated west of the nesson anticline in williams and mckenzie counties  north dakota 
the three forks is an unconventional carbonate play that lies just below the bakken 
similar to the bakken  the three forks is primarily exploited using horizontal drilling and advanced completion techniques 
drilling in the three forks began in mid and a number of operators  including us  are targeting this objective 
drilling in this objective is early  but initial results appear to indicate that the three forks is a separate reservoir from the bakken  which increases our exposure to oil reserves in the basin 
over time  further drilling of both bakken and three forks wells in the same sections will help to delineate whether the bakken and three forks are separate reservoirs 
the red river is a conventional oil resource at a depth of approximately  feet 
the red river is exploited via vertical well bores with minimal completion procedures 
targets are identified using a proprietary d seismic attribute analysis 
since late  we have drilled and completed three red river discoveries in sheridan county  montana 
overview of williston basin acreage position our acreage position in the williston basin is comprised of approximately  net acres 
approximately  net acres is east of the nesson anticline in mountrail county  north dakota and adjoining counties to the north  south and east 
acreage east of the nesson anticline includes approximately  net acres in our parshall austin sanish project area in mountrail county where drilling activities are typically operated by others and we therefore participate in wells in a non operated role 
acreage east of the nesson anticline also incorporates approximately  net acres in our ross project area in mountrail county where we both operate and participate in non operated north dakota wells 
currently  we anticipate drilling operated gross wells net in and around our mountrail county  north dakota acreage position in approximately  net areas is west of the nesson anticline in williams and mckenzie counties  north dakota in our rough rider project area 
acreage in our rough rider project area is subject to the drilling participation agreement outlined below 
typically  because of our higher working interests in spacing units  we operate wells in our rough rider area but to a lesser degree will also participate in wells in a non operated role 
currently  we anticipate drilling operated gross wells net in our rough rider project area in the remaining  net acres is located in eastern montana in roosevelt and sheridan counties in our ghost rider project area 
activity in montana has been limited but towards the end of other operators began drilling and or permitting wells in the area 
currently  we anticipate drilling one operated gross well net on our montana acreage in to test the prospectivity of the bakken  as well as other conventional or unconventional producing horizons 
overview of rough rider drilling participation agreement in late august  we entered into a drilling participation agreement in our rough rider project area in order to accelerate operations and address near term state lease expirations 
the initial group of six wells under the agreement has been drilled 
in each of the initial six wells  we have retained of our original working interest and will back in for of our counterparty s interest in the combined six well group after combined payout defined as the point in time when the cumulative net receipts from the initial wells equals or exceeds all expenditures for such wells 
our counterparty had the option to participate in an additional nine wells 
in december our counterparty elected to participate in the next group of four wells and in january  our counterparty elected to participate in the final group of five wells 
we have elected to retain our maximum interest of of our original working interest in the additional nine wells 
further  we will have the option to keep up to of our original working interest in all subsequent in fill development wells in all drilling units

during  we anticipate spending approximately million to drill and complete gross net operated wells and net non operated wells in the williston basin 
additionally  we anticipate spending approximately million on land and seismic 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital commitments overview of capital activity 
onshore gulf coast province our onshore gulf coast province is a high potential  multi pay province that lends itself to d seismic exploration due to its substantial structural and stratigraphic complexity 
we believe our established d seismic exploration approach  combined with our exploration staff s extensive experience and accumulated knowledge base in the onshore gulf coast province  provides us with significant competitive advantages 
key operating trends within this province include the vicksburg trend in brooks county  texas  the miocene and upper oligocene trends in southern louisiana and the frio trend in and around matagorda county  texas 

table of contents during  activity in the onshore gulf coast province was significantly reduced due to depressed natural gas prices and our allocation of capital to the williston basin 
during the year  we completed one gross well net in one attempt for a completion rate of 
in  we spent million on drilling  land and seismic in our onshore gulf coast province 
our capital expenditures were allocated to southern louisiana  to the frio and to the vicksburg 
for  we currently plan to spend million in our onshore gulf coast province 
approximately million of this spending has been allocated to drilling  with the remaining million allocated to land and seismic activities 
we anticipate that approximately of the drilling  land and seismic will be allocated to the vicksburg trend with the remaining allocated to other areas in the province 
vicksburg trend our vicksburg activity is focused principally in brooks county  texas  in our home run  triple crowne  and floyd fields 
we discovered these fields in  and  respectively 
since  we have drilled vicksburg wells and we have completed of those wells 
we believe we have a multi year inventory of proved  probable and possible drilling locations in our home run  triple crown and floyd fields 
in  we spent approximately million establishing production from zones that were classified as proved developed not producing at year end in  we anticipate drilling one operated gross net well in the vicksburg trend in the first half of depending upon both favorable natural gas prices and service costs 
southern louisiana trend in southern louisiana  we have utilized our geophysical  geological and operational expertise to explore for hydrocarbon bearing miocene and oligocene reservoirs 
these reservoirs are generally on trend with the texas gulf coast frio and are therefore logical extensions of our drilling activities 
in december  we entered into a joint venture to operate the drilling of at least five prospects over the subsequent months  earning a working interest 
in february  the remaining joint venture well  the chandeleur sound sl  was brought on line at an initial production rate of approximately mmcfe per day 
we maintain a working interest in the well 
during  we spent million in southern louisiana primarily to complete wells in progress at year end in  we have no current plans to drill in southern louisiana 
frio trend during  we drilled one operated gross well net in matagorda county  texas 
the gs harrison unit was completed in march and was production tested at an early rate of mmcfe per day from the lowest feet of pay 
in  we have no current plans to drill in the frio trend 
anadarko basin province the anadarko basin is located in the texas panhandle and western oklahoma 
we believe this prolific natural gas producing province offers a combination of relatively lower risk exploration and development opportunities in shallower horizons  as well as higher risk  but higher reserve potential opportunities in the deeper sections that have been relatively under explored 
the stratigraphic and structural objectives in the anadarko basin can provide excellent targets for d seismic imaging 
in addition  drilling economics in the anadarko basin are enhanced by the multi pay nature of many of the prospects  with secondary or tertiary targets serving as either incremental value or as alternatives if the primary target zone is not productive 
our recent activity has been focused primarily in the hunton  springer channel  springer bar and granite wash trends 

table of contents in  we received proceeds of million related to the sale of mineral interests 
because of the sale  we spent a million in the anadarko basin during in  we have no current plans to drill in the anadarko basin 
west texas and other province the permian basin of west texas and eastern new mexico is a predominantly oil producing province with generally longer life reserves than that of our onshore gulf coast 
our drilling activity in our west texas province has been focused primarily in various carbonate reservoirs  including the canyon reef and fusselman formations of the horseshoe atoll trend  the canyon reef of the eastern shelf  the wolfcamp and devonian section of new mexico  and the mississippian reef of the hardeman basin  at depths ranging from  to  feet 
during  we completed one gross well in two attempts for a completion rate and spent a total of million on drilling  land and seismic 
we anticipate spending million to drill gross net wells in west texas in title to properties we believe we have satisfactory title  in all material respects  to substantially all of our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry 
our properties are subject to royalty interests  standard liens incident to operating agreements  liens for current taxes and other burdens  which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect the value of such properties 
substantially all of our proved oil and natural gas properties are pledged as collateral for borrowings under our senior credit facility

the preparation of our reserve report is outlined in our sarbanes oxley act section internal control procedures 
our procedures require that our reserve report is prepared by a registered independent engineering firm at the end of every year based on information provided by our reservoir engineering department 
our reservoir engineering department accumulates historical production data for our wells  calculates historical lease operating expenses and differentials  updates working interests and net revenue interests  obtains updated authorizations for expenditure from our operational engineering department and obtains logs  d seismic and other geological and geophysical information from our geological and geophysical department 
this data is forwarded to cawley  gillespie associates  inc cga  our registered independent petroleum consultants 

table of contents cga prepares a report of our estimated proved reserves in their entirety based on the information provided to them 
cga is a texas registered engineering firm f

todd brooker  vice president 
mr 
brooker is a state of texas licensed professional engineer license 
see exhibit report of cawley  gillespie associates  inc in accordance with applicable requirements of the securities and exchange commission sec  estimates of our net proved reserves and future net revenues are made using average prices at the beginning of each month in the month period prior to the date of such reserve estimates and are held constant throughout the life of the properties except to the extent a contract specifically provides for escalation 
estimated quantities of net proved reserves and future net revenues therefrom are affected by oil and natural gas prices  which have fluctuated widely in recent years 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies new accounting pronouncements 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their estimated values  including many factors beyond our control 
the reserve data set forth in the cga report represents only estimates 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geologic interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates of different engineers  including those used by us  may vary 
in addition  estimates of reserves are subject to revision based upon actual production  results of future development and exploration activities  prevailing oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and other factors 
the revisions may be material 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered and are highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based 
our estimated net proved reserves  included in our sec filings  have not been filed with or included in reports to any other federal agency 
see item a 
risk factors although our oil and natural gas reserve data is independently estimated  these estimates may still prove to be inaccurate 
estimates with respect to net proved reserves that may be developed and produced in the future are often based upon volumetric calculations and upon analogy to similar types of reserves rather than actual production history 
estimates based on these methods are generally less reliable than those based on actual production history 
subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production history will result in variations in the estimated reserves that may be substantial 
proved undeveloped reserves our total proved undeveloped pud reserves as of december  were mmboe 
pud reserves represented of our total proved reserves in versus in the increase in our pud reserves as a percentage of our total proved reserves was attributable to the application of advanced drilling and completion techniques  improved oil prices  reduced service costs and the modernization of sec reserve reporting rules 
the application of advance drilling and completion techniques  which incorporates drilling long laterals and completing wells with swell packers and between and fracture stimulation stages in  appears to have enhanced our estimated ultimate recoveries eurs and thereby improved our rates of return 
during  we applied these advanced drilling and completion techniques to areas that had previously experienced minimal drilling activity and drilled apparently economic wells 
in these areas  we were able to increase our level of pud reserves 
oil prices used in our year end reserve report increased relative to during  service costs decreased approximately as the pace of drilling activity in the united states decreased due to the economic crisis  resulting recession and scarcity of available capital 
enhanced oil prices and reduced service costs improved our rates of return and allowed us to book pud reserves in previously uneconomic locations 
enhanced oil prices also typically lengthens the time that a well can be economically produced and therefore increases the amount of economically recoverable reserves over the life of the well 

table of contents the modernization of sec oil and gas reporting rules also enhanced our level of pud reserves 
effective with years ending on or after december   the sec modernized its rules with respect to oil and gas reserves for the first time since the new rules increased the number of offsetting pud locations we were able to book in unconventional resource plays such as the williston basin from two in to four in the increased number of offsetting locations we are able to book allowed us to increase our level of pud reserves and  therefore  also increased our level of total proved reserves 
approximately mmboe in reserves were booked at year end related to the sec rules changes 
partially offsetting the above pud reserve increases  we eliminated multiple pud reserve locations in areas that we currently do not anticipate drilling within the next five years 
the pud reserve locations that we eliminated were primarily natural gas drilling locations in areas outside of our core williston basin and south texas acreage positions and totaled mmboe 
our pud reserves also decreased due to the drilling of gross pud wells net during during the year  we spent approximately million dollars converting mmboe from pud to proved developed producing reserves 
reconciliation of standardized measure to pre tax pv pre tax pv is the estimated present value of the future net revenues from our proved oil and natural gas reserves before income taxes discounted using a discount rate 
pre tax pv is considered a non gaap financial measure under sec regulations because it does not include the effects of future income taxes  as is required in computing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
we believe that pre tax pv is an important measure that can be used to evaluate the relative significance of our oil and natural gas properties and that pre tax pv is widely used by securities analysts and investors when evaluating oil and natural gas companies 
because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid  the use of a pre tax measure provides greater comparability of assets when evaluating companies 
we believe that most other companies in the oil and natural gas industry calculate pre tax pv on the same basis 
pre tax pv is computed on the same basis as the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows but without deducting income taxes 
the table below provides a reconciliation of our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows to our pre tax pv value in millions 
at december  standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows add present value of future income tax discounted at pre tax pv
