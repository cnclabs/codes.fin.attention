item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the discussion under selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under the caption risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview cytrx corporation we are a biopharmaceutical research and development company engaged in the development of high value human therapeutics  specializing in oncology 
our drug development pipeline includes clinical development of three product candidates for cancer indications  including three planned phase clinical trials for inno as a treatment for pancreatic cancer  gastric stomach cancer and soft tissue sarcomas  two phase proof of concept clinical trials with bafetinib in patients with high risk b cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia  or b cll  and patients with glioblastoma multiforme  and a registration study of tamibarotene for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia  or apl 
in addition to our core oncology programs  we are developing two drug candidates based on our molecular chaperone regulation technology  which aim to repair or degrade mis folded proteins associated with disease 
apart from our drug development programs  we currently maintain a equity interest in our former subsidiary  rxi 
in order to fund our business and operations  we have relied primarily upon sales of our equity securities  including proceeds received upon the exercise of options and warrants  and sales of our shares of rxi common stock 
we also have received limited payments from our strategic partners and licensees 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  marketable securities of million and held  shares of restricted common stock of rxi with a market value of million based upon the closing price of the rxi common stock on that date 
on july   we raised approximately million  net of fees and expenses  in a registered direct offering  and on september   we raised approximately million  net of fees  from the sale of  shares of our common stock of rxi 
management believes that our current cash on hand  together with our marketable securities and proceeds from possible future sales of rxi common stock  will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
the estimate is based  in part  upon our currently projected expenditures for of approximately million unaudited  which includes approximately million unaudited for our clinical programs for inno  approximately million unaudited for our clinical programs for bafetinib  approximately million unaudited for our clinical program for tamibarotene  approximately million unaudited for our activities for arimoclomol  approximately million unaudited for general operation of its clinical programs  and approximately million unaudited for other general and administrative expenses 
these projected expenditures are also based upon numerous other assumptions and subject to many uncertainties  and actual expenditures may be significantly different from these projections 
we will be required to obtain additional funding in order to execute our long term business plans  although we do not currently have commitments from any third parties to provide us with capital 
the fair value of common stock investment in rxi is subject to market fluctuations that could impact the amount of cash we generate from the sale of rxi shares in the future 
we cannot assure that additional funding will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if we fail to obtain additional funding when needed  we may not be able to execute our business plans and our business may suffer  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our separation from rxi pharmaceuticals corporation rxi pharmaceuticals corporation was founded in april by us and four researchers in the field of rnai  including dr 
craig mello  recipient of the nobel prize for medicine for his co discovery of rnai 
rnai is a naturally occurring mechanism for the regulation of gene expression that has the potential to selectively inhibit the activity of any human gene 
in january  we transferred to rxi substantially all of our rnai related technologies and assets  and rxi began operating on a stand alone basis for the purpose of accelerating the discovery of rnai therapeutics previously sponsored by us 
rxi s initial focus is on developing rnai based product candidates for treating neurological and metabolic disorders and cancer 
until early  we owned approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock of rxi and our financial statements  including our financial statements as of and for the year ended december   included the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of rxi 
on february   our board of directors declared a dividend of one share of rxi common stock for each approximately shares of our common stock held by such stockholders  which was paid on march  and which reduced our ownership of rxi shares to less than 
for periods beginning with the first quarter of  we began to account for our investment in rxi using the equity method  under which we record only our pro rata share of the financial results of rxi as equity in loss of unconsolidated subsidiary on our statements of operations 
because a portion of rxi s financial results for and all of rxi s financial results for were not recorded by us under the equity method  our results of operations for the year ended december  are not directly comparable to results of operations for the same periods in prior years 
research and development expenditures for research and development activities related to continuing operations were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  or approximately  and  respectively  of our total expenses 
research and development expenses are further discussed below under critical accounting policies and estimates and results of operations 
our currently projected expenditures for include approximately million for our clinical programs for inno  approximately million for our clinical programs for bafetinib  approximately million for our clinical program for tamibarotene  approximately million for our activities for arimoclomol  and approximately million for general operation of our clinical programs 
the actual cost of our clinical programs could differ significantly from our current projections due to any additional requirements or delays imposed by the fda in connection with our planned trials  or if actual costs are higher than current management estimates for other reasons  including complications with manufacturing 
in the event that actual costs of our clinical program  or any of our other ongoing research activities  are significantly higher than our current estimates  we may be required to significantly modify our planned level of operations 
there is a risk that any drug discovery and development program may not produce revenue because of the risks inherent in drug discovery and development 
the successful development of any product candidate is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from any product candidate  due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of our ability to advance product candidates into pre clinical and clinical trials  the scope  rate and progress of our pre clinical trials and other research and development activities  the scope  rate of progress and cost of any clinical trials we commence  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
any failure to complete any stage of the development of our products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  stock options  impairment of long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  accrued liabilities and certain expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note of the notes to financial statements included in this annual report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue consists of license fees from strategic alliances with pharmaceutical companies as well as service and grant revenues 
service revenue consists of contract research and laboratory consulting 
grant revenues consist of government and private grants 
monies received for license fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
milestone payments will be recognized upon achievement of themilestone as long as the milestone is deemed substantive and we have no other performance obligations related to the milestone and collectability is reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt  or recognized upon termination of the agreement and all related obligations 
deferred revenue represents amounts received prior to revenue recognition 
revenues from contract research  government grants  and consulting fees are recognized over the respective contract periods as the services are performed  provided there is persuasive evidence or an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
once all conditions of the grant are met and no contingencies remain outstanding  the revenue is recognized as grant fee revenue and an earned but unbilled revenue receivable is recorded 
in august  we received approximately million in proceeds from the privately funded als charitable remainder trust alscrt in exchange for the commitment to continue research and development of arimoclomol and other potential treatments for als and a one percent royalty in the worldwide sales of arimoclomol 
we accounted for the transaction under asc previously statement of financial accounting standards no 
 research and development arrangements 
accordingly  we recorded the value received under the arrangement as deferred service revenue and recognize service revenue  using the proportional performance method of revenue recognition  on a dollar for dollar basis for each dollar of expense incurred for the research and development of arimoclomol and other potential als treatments 
in august  we were released from all restrictions on the use of any proceeds previously paid to us in connection with the arrangement 
as a result  we recognized in the third quarter million of service revenue representing the remaining deferred revenue and previously un recognized portion of the value received in the transaction with alscrt 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized approximately million and million  respectively  of service revenue related to this transaction 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for direct and overhead related research expenses and are expensed as incurred 
costs to acquire technologies  including licenses  that are utilized in research and development and that have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred 
technology developed for use in its products is expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses  which are included in research and development expenses  include obligations resulting from the company s contracts with various clinical research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for its product candidates 
we recognize expenses for these activities based on a variety of factors  including actual and estimated labor hours  clinical site initiation activities  patient enrollment rates  estimates of external costs and other activity based factors 
we believe that this method best approximates the efforts expended on a clinical trial with the expenses we record 
we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
if our estimates are incorrect  clinical trial expenses recorded in any particular period could vary 
stock based compensation our stock based employee compensation plans are described in note of the notes to our financial statements 
we have adopted the provisions of asc previously sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and non employees 
for stock options and stock warrants paid in consideration of services rendered by non employees  we recognize compensation expense in accordance with the requirements of asc previously sfas no 
r  asc previously emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services and asc previously eitf  accounting recognition for certain transactions involving equity instruments granted to other than employees  as amended 
non employee option grants that do not vest immediately upon grant are recorded as an expense over the vesting period 
at the end of each financial reporting period prior to performance  the value of these options  as calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  is determined  and compensation expense recognized or recovered during the period is adjusted accordingly 
since the fair market value of options granted to non employees is subject to change in the future  the amount of the future compensation expense is subject to adjustment until the common stock options or warrants are fully vested 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  for impairment on an annual basis  as of december  or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of such assets below their carrying values 
an impairment loss would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods 
if our estimates used in the determination of either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods are not accurate as compared to actual future results  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
the fixed assets  from our san diego laboratory and our molecular library  available for sale were re allocated from equipment and furnishings to assets held for sale and were written down to their estimated net realizable value as of september  net income loss per share basic net income loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
diluted net income loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common share and common share equivalents outstanding 
common share equivalents that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future  and that were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share  totaled approximately million shares  million shares and million shares at december   and  respectively 
as a result of our march  distribution by our stockholders of approximately of the outstanding shares of rxi  we recorded a deemed dividend of approximately  the deemed dividend was reflected as an adjustment to net loss for the first quarter of to arrive at net loss applicable to common stockholders on the consolidated statement of operations and for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per shares 
quarterly financial data the following table sets forth unaudited consolidated statements of operations data for each quarter during our most recent two fiscal years 
this quarterly information has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements and  in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods covered 
the quarterly financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
quarters ended march june september december in thousands  except per share data total revenues net income loss net income loss applicable to common stockholders basic and diluted income loss per share applicable to common stock total revenues net loss deemed dividend for anti dilution adjustments made to outstanding common stock warrants net loss applicable to common stockholders basic and diluted loss per share applicable to common stock quarterly and yearly loss per share amounts are computed independently of each other 
therefore  the sum of the per share amounts for the quarters may not equal the per share amounts for the year 
in and we incurred million and million  respectively  in employee non cash compensation expenses 
in connection with our adjustment to the exercise terms of certain outstanding warrants to purchase common stock on march   we recorded deemed dividends of  these deemed dividends are reflected as an adjustment to net loss for the first quarter of to arrive at net loss applicable to common stockholders on the consolidated statement of operations and for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per shares 
liquidity and capital resources general in order to fund our business and operations  we have relied primarily upon sales of our equity securities  including proceeds received upon the exercise of options and warrants  and sales of our shares of rxi common stock 
we also have received limited payments from our strategic partners and licensees 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  marketable securities of million and held  shares of restricted common stock of rxi with a market value of million based upon the closing price of the rxi common stock on that date 
on july   we raised approximately million  net of fees and expenses  in a registered direct offering  and on september   we raised approximately million  net of fees  from the sale of  shares of our common stock of rxi 
management believes that our current cash on hand  together with our marketable securities and proceeds from possible future sales of rxi common stock  will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
the estimate is based  in part  upon our currently projected expenditures for of approximately million unaudited  which includes approximately million unaudited for our clinical programs for inno  approximately million unaudited for our clinical programs for bafetinib  approximately million unaudited for our clinical program for tamibarotene  approximately million unaudited for our activities for arimoclomol  approximately million unaudited for general operation of its clinical programs  and approximately million unaudited for other general and administrative expenses 
these projected expenditures are also based upon numerous other assumptions and subject to many uncertainties  and actual expenditures may be significantly different from these projections 
we will be required to obtain additional funding in order to execute our long term business plans  although we do not currently have commitments from any third parties to provide us with capital 
the fair value of common stock investment in rxi is subject to market fluctuations that could impact the amount of cash we generate from the sale of rxi shares in the future 
we cannot assure that additional funding will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if we fail to obtain additional funding when needed  we may not be able to execute our business plans and our business may suffer  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if we obtain marketing approval as currently planned and successfully commercialize our product candidates  we anticipate it will take a minimum of three years  and possibly longer  for us to generate significant recurring revenue  and we will be dependent on future financing until such time  if ever  as we can generate significant recurring revenue 
our ability to raise capital has been materially and adversely affected by the continuing poor economy 
despite the recovery in the us financial markets in  the market remains severely depressed for private investment in public equities  or pipes  transactions on which we have relied for raising needed capital 
these conditions also may materially and adversely affect the market for our rxi shares 
we have no commitments from third parties to provide us with any additional financing  and we may not be able to obtain future financing on favorable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain adequate financing would adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to stockholders may result and new investors could have rights superior to holders of the shares issued in this offering 
in addition  debt financing  if available  may include restrictive covenants 
if adequate funds are not available to us  we may have to liquidate some or all of our assets or to delay or reduce the scope of or eliminate some portion or all of our development programs or clinical trials 
we also may have to license to other companies our product candidates or technologies that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves 
discussion of operating  investing and financing activities net loss for the year ended december  was million  and cash used for operating activities for that period was million 
the net loss for the year reflects million of revenue recognized under the agreement with alscrt  and million for stock option and warrant expense 
net loss for the year ended december  was million  and cash used for operating activities for that period was million 
the net loss for the year reflects million of revenue recognized under the agreement with alscrt  a expense of million related to the acquisition of innovive s in process research and development  a loss of million in our equity in rxi  and million for stock option and warrant expense 
net loss for the year ended december  was million  and cash used for operating activities for that period was million 
the net loss for the year reflects million of revenue recognized under the agreement with alscrt and million for stock option and warrant expense 
for the year ended december   million was used in investing activities 
this included million used to purchase marketable securities  which was partially offset by proceeds of million from the sale of  of our shares of common stock rxi 
for the year ended december   million was used in investing activities including million of rxi funds resulting from converting marketable securities to cash equivalents that is not available to us due to the deconsolidation 
the total cash outlay to acquire innovive totaled million  which related primarily to the payment of innovive s accounts payable 
the other million was used for the purchase of equipment and furnishings  primarily associated with equipping the san diego laboratory 
for the year ended december   million was used in investing activities 
of this amount  million was used by rxi for the purchase of marketable securities 
the other million was used for the purchase of equipment and furnishings primarily associated with equipping our san diego laboratory

cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
during  we received million from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
during  we raised million in a private placement of our common stock and an additional million from the exercise of previously outstanding stock options and warrants 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
contractual obligations we acquire assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development 
milestone payments may be required  contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg  approval of the product for marketing by a regulatory agency 
if required by the arrangement  we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained 
because of the contingent nature of these payments  they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 
these arrangements may be material individually  and in the event that milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same period  the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period 
in addition  these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product  which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments  however  we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives 
our current contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in thousands operating leases employment agreements subtotal research and development total and thereafter total operating leases are primarily facility lease related obligations  as well as equipment and software lease obligations with third party vendors 
we are entitled to receive future rental income under subleases in place which would be offset against future operating lease obligations as follows  in   in and  in employment agreements include management contracts  which have been revised from time to time  provide for minimum salary levels  adjusted annually at the discretion of our compensation committee  as well as for minimum bonuses that are payable 
research and development obligations relate primarily to clinical trials 
most of these purchase obligations are cancelable 
we apply the disclosure provisions of asc formerly fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of other  to our contractual guarantees and indemnities 
we have provided contractual indemnities to investors and other parties against possible losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties in connection with various types of third party claims  as well as indemnities to our officers and directors against third party claims arising from the services they provide to us 
to date  we have not incurred material costs as a result of these indemnities  and we do not expect to incur material costs in the future  further  we maintain insurance to cover certain losses arising from these indemnities 
accordingly  we have not accrued any liabilities in our consolidated financial statements related to these indemnities 
net operating loss carryforwards at december   we had united states federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to offset against future taxable income  which expire in through approximately million of our federal net operating loss carryforwards are limited in their availability to million annually 
management currently believes that the remaining million in federal net operating loss carryforwards  and the million in state net operating loss carryforwards as of december   are unrestricted 
however  management is reviewing its recent equity transactions to determine if they may have resulted in any further restrictions on the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we also had research and development and alternative minimum tax credits for federal and state purposes of approximately million and  respectively  available for offset against future income taxes  which expire in through based on an assessment of all available evidence including  but not limited to  our limited operating history in our core business and lack of profitability  uncertainties of the commercial viability of its technology  the impact of government regulation and healthcare reform initiatives  and other risks normally associated with biotechnology companies  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that these net operating loss carryforwards and credits will not be realized and  as a result  a deferred tax valuation allowance has been recorded against these assets 
results of operations we incurred a net loss of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during fiscal  we recognized million in service revenues relating to our million sale to the alscrt of a one percent royalty interest in the worldwide sales of arimoclomol in august pursuant to an amendment signed between us and thebeneficiary of the alscrt on august   we were released from all restrictions on the use of any proceeds previously paid to us in connection with the arrangement 
as a result  we recognized million as service revenue in the third quarter of  which represented the remaining deferred revenue and previously un recognized portion of the value received 
in the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in service revenues  respectively 
during  and  we earned an immaterial amount of license fees and grant revenue 
all future licensing fees under our current licensing agreements are dependent upon successful development milestones being achieved by the licensor 
during fiscal  we are not anticipating the receipt of any significant service or licensing fees 
our net loss may increase from current levels primarily due to expenses related to our ongoing and planned clinical trials  research and development programs  possible technology acquisitions  and other general corporate activities 
we anticipate  therefore  that our operating results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as predictive of the results in future periods 
research and development years ended december  in thousands research and development expenses non cash research and development expenses impairment loss on fixed assets employee stock option expense research expenses are expenses incurred by us in the discovery of new information that will assist us in the creation and the development of new drugs or treatments 
development expenses are expenses incurred by us in our efforts to commercialize the findings generated through our research efforts 
research and development expenses incurred during  and relate to our various development programs 
in  we substantially completed the initial phase of our new drug discovery research in our laboratory facility in san diego  california  which account for the significant decrease in research and development expenses from in  only the months of january and february included rxi related expenses totaling approximately million  which accounts for the significant decrease in research and development expenses  and non cash research and development expenses 
in  our development costs associated included approximately million for our clinical programs for inno  approximately million for our clinical programs for bafetinib  million for our clinical program for tamibarotene  approximately million for our activities for arimoclomol  approximately million for general operation of our clinical programs  and approximately million for other general and administrative expenses 
none of our research and development costs have ever been capitalized 
as compensation to scientific advisory board sab members and consultants  and in connection with the acquisition of technology  we and rxi sometimes issue shares of common stock  stock options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock 
for financial statement purposes  we value these shares of common stock  stock options  and warrants at the fair value of the common stock  stock options or warrants granted  or the services received  whichever is more reliably measurable 
we recorded charges recovery of million  million and million in this regard during  and  respectively 
included in the research and development charges for were million of expense related to rxi s issuance of  shares of common stock to umms for certain license agreement rights and a new invention disclosure agreement and million for non qualifying stock options to sab members of rxi 
in  we recorded million of employee stock option expense as compared to million in and million in we also incurred an expenditure of million in related to the acquisition of innovive s in process research and development  which has been reflected as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations 
in  we expect our research and development expenses to increase as a result of our clinical programs with inno  bafetinib and tamibarotene 
general and administrative expenses year ended december  in thousands general and administrative expenses stock  stock option and warrant expenses to non employees and consultants employee stock option expense general and administrative expenses include all administrative salaries and general corporate expenses  including legal expenses associated with the prosecution of our intellectual property 
our general and administrative expenses  excluding common stock  stock options and warrants issued  and excluding depreciation expense  were million in  million in and million  respectively  in general and administrative expenses in included million of rxi related expenses 
in  we recognized rxi related expenses for january and february only of million 
no rxi related expenses were recognized in general and administrative expenses in decreased by million as compared to  due primarily to the million of rxi related expenses recognized in in  legal and accounting auditing expenses decreased by approximately  and  respectively  primarily due to the higher expenses incurred in in connection with our acquisition of innovive  as well as efficiencies in the administrative area 
from time to time  we issue shares of our common stock or warrants or options to purchase shares of our common stock to consultants and other service providers in exchange for services 
for financial statement purposes  we value these shares of common stock  stock options  and warrants at the fair value of the common stock  stock options or warrants granted  or the services received  whichever we can measure more reliably 
we recorded employee stock option expense of million in  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the greater amount in primarily related to stock options granted by rxi to recruit and retain directors  officers and additional employees 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
the depreciation expense reflects the depreciation of our fixed assets and the amortization expenses related to our molecular library 
the decrease in relates to a lower depreciation base due to the re class of fixed assets to assets held for sale and the value of the molecular library related to the closure of the san diego lab in the third quarter of other income in  we recognized a gain of million on the valuation of our warrant derivative liability related to warrants issued in july in july  we recognized a gain of million on the sale of rxi shares 
in march  we recognized a gain of million on the transfer of some rxi common stock to certain employees 
in june  we recognized million of income arising from a fee received pursuant to a change in control provision included in the purchase agreement for our sale of our animal pharmaceutical unit 
interest income interest income was million in  million in and million in the variances between years are attributable primarily to the amount of funds available for investment each year and  to a lesser extent  changes in prevailing market rates 
noncontrolling interest in rxi we offset  of losses in noncontrolling interest in rxi against our net loss for the months of january and february for the remainder of the year  and for  rxi s gain and losses were accounted for under the equity method  because we owned less than of rxi following our march  distribution to our stockholders of rxi shares

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited primarily to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because a significant portion of our investments are in short term debt securities issued by the us government and institutional money market funds 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal 
due to the nature of our marketable securities  we believe that we are not exposed to any material market risk 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments or foreign currency instruments 
if interest rates had varied by in the year ended december   it would not have had a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows for that period
