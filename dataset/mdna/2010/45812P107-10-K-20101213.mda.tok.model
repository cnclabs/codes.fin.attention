item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs and markets high performance integrated circuits for the following key markets i digital consumer electronics  ii networking and telecommunications  iii mobile communications  iv automotive electronics and v industrial applications 
we were founded in october our primary products are low and medium density dram in both package and known good die kgd form and high speed and low power sram 
in fiscal  approximately of our revenue was derived from our dram and sram products 
sales of our low and medium density dram products have represented a majority of our net sales in each year since fiscal in january  we formed a separate business unit  giantec semiconductor  inc giantec 
as part of this formation  shanghai zhang jiang science technology investment corporation invested approximately million in giantec 
we still own more than of giantec and  as such  continue to consolidate the financial results of giantec 
giantec is actively seeking additional equity investment from outside investors and in the event such investment is obtained  our ownership could be diluted to be less than  in which case we would no longer consolidate giantec 
through our giantec business unit  we design and market application specific standard products assp primarily eeproms and smartcards focused on our key markets 
in order to control our operating expenses  for the past several years we limited our headcount in the us and transferred various functions to taiwan and china 
we believe this strategy has enabled us to limit our operating expenses while simultaneously locating these functions closer to our manufacturing partners and our customers 
as a result of these efforts  we currently have significantly more employees in asia than we do in the us we intend to continue these strategies going forward 
as a fabless semiconductor company  our business model is less capital intensive because we rely on third parties to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
because of our dependence on third party wafer foundries  our ability to increase our unit sales volumes depends on our ability to increase our wafer capacity allocation from current foundries  add additional foundries and improve yields of good die per wafer 
the average selling prices of our dram and sram products are sensitive to supply and demand conditions in our target markets and have generally declined over time 
we experienced declines in the average selling prices for many of our products in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal however  the average selling prices for certain of our dram products have increased since the latter part of our september quarter and these average selling price increases have continued into the september quarter 
we expect average selling prices for our products to decline in the future  principally due to market demand  market competition and the supply of competitive products in the market 
any future decreases in our average selling prices could have an adverse impact on our revenue growth rate  gross margins and operating margins 
our ability to maintain or increase revenues will be highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in average selling prices of existing products 
declining average selling prices will adversely affect our gross margins unless we are able to offset such declines with commensurate reductions in per unit costs or changes in product mix in favor of higher margin products 
revenue from product sales to our direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
a portion of our sales is made to distributors under agreements that provide for the possibility of certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges 
given the uncertainties associated with credits that will be issued to these distributors  we defer recognition of such sales until our products are sold by the distributors to their end customers 
revenue from sales to distributors who do not have sales price rebates or product return privileges is recognized at the time our products are sold by us to the distributors 

table of contents we market and sell our products in asia  the us and europe and other locations through our direct sales force  distributors and sales representatives 
the percentage of our sales shipped outside the us was approximately  and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we measure sales location by the shipping destination  even if the customer is headquartered in the us we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to represent a significant percentage of our net sales 
the percentages of our net sales by region are set forth in the following table fiscal years ended september  asia europe us other total our sales are generally made by purchase orders 
because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice  backlog may not be a good indicator of our future sales 
cancellations of customer orders or changes in product specifications could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 
since a significant portion of our revenue is from the digital consumer electronics market  our business may be subject to seasonality  with increased revenues in the third and fourth calendar quarters of each year  when customers place orders to meet year end holiday demand 
however  due to the complex nature of the markets we serve and the broad fluctuations in economic conditions in the us and other countries  it is difficult for us to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including economic conditions in asia  particularly taiwan and china  changes in trade policy and regulatory requirements  duties  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  the burdens of complying with foreign laws and  possibly  political instability 
most of our foundries and all of our assembly and test subcontractors are located in asia 
although our international sales are largely denominated in us dollars  we do have sales transactions in new taiwan dollars  in hong kong dollars and in chinese renminbi 
in addition  we have foreign operations where expenses are generally denominated in the local currency 
such transactions expose us to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
we monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  but have not adopted any hedging strategies to date 
there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business and operating results in the future 
due to the continued uncertain economic conditions  our current or potential customers may delay or reduce purchases of our products  which would adversely affect our revenues and harm our business and financial results 
in addition  the continued uncertainty in the financial markets may have an adverse effect on the us and world economies  which may negatively impact the spending patterns of businesses including our current and potential customers 
we expect our business to be adversely impacted by any future downturn in the us or global economies 
in the past  industry downturns have resulted in reduced demand and declining average selling prices for our products which adversely affected our business 
we expect to continue to experience these adverse business conditions in the event of further downturns 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales consist principally of total product sales less estimated sales returns 
net sales increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales of million was principally due to a significant increase in unit shipments and an increase in average selling prices for certain of our dram products in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  unit shipments of 
table of contents both our sram products and our application specific standard products assp which include our eeprom  smart card and logic products increased in fiscal compared to fiscal we anticipate that the average selling prices of our existing products will generally decline over time  although the rate of decline may fluctuate for certain products 
there can be no assurance that any future price declines will be offset by higher volumes or by higher prices on newer products 
in fiscal  revenue from our largest distributor accounted for of net sales and revenue from our second largest distributor accounted for of our net sales 
in fiscal  revenue from our largest distributor accounted for of net sales 
gross profit 
cost of sales includes die cost from the wafers acquired from foundries  subcontracted package  assembly and test costs  costs associated with in house product testing  quality assurance and import duties 
gross profit increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our gross margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal can be attributed to an improvement in product mix  the effect of better pricing in certain target markets  cost reductions for certain products and the favorable impact in fiscal from the sales of items previously written down to lower of cost or market combined with a decrease in inventory write downs 
our gross margin for fiscal included inventory write downs of million while our gross margin for fiscal included inventory write downs of million 
the inventory write downs were for excess and obsolescence issues and lower of cost or market accounting on certain of our products 
our gross margin for fiscal and fiscal benefited from the sale of million and million  respectively  of products previously written down to zero carrying value 
the increase in our gross profit in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily a result of an increase in unit shipments across all our products but more significantly for our dram products 
we believe that the average selling prices of our products will decline over time and  unless we are able to reduce our cost per unit or improve our product mix to higher gross margin products to the extent necessary to offset such declines  the decline in average selling prices will result in a material decline in our gross margin 
in addition  our product costs could increase if our suppliers raise prices  which could result in a material decline in our gross margin 
when demand for end products have increased  such as in fiscal  foundries have raised wafer prices 
although we have product cost reduction programs in place that involve efforts to reduce internal costs and supplier costs  there can be no assurance that product costs will be reduced or that such reductions will be sufficient to offset the expected declines in average selling prices 
we do not believe that such cost reduction efforts are likely to have a material adverse impact on the quality of our products or the level of service provided by us 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses of million can be attributed to an increase in expenditures for masks  other product development costs and an increase in headcount related expenses associated with our acquisition of enable 
in addition  fiscal reflects expense for our employee profit sharing program which was implemented at the beginning of fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million can be attributed to an increase in sales commissions in fiscal as a result of our higher revenue and an increase in payroll related expenses 
in addition  fiscal reflects expense for our employee profit sharing program which was implemented at the beginning of fiscal acquired in process technology charge 
in fiscal  we incurred a million ipr d charge in connection with our acquisition of enable 
the million allocated to ipr d was expensed in fiscal as it was deemed to have no future alternative use 

table of contents interest and other income  net

the gain on the sale of investments was million in fiscal as we sold all of our shares of ralink for approximately million and recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in fiscal  there were no gains on the sale of investments 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax expense of million for fiscal the income tax expense of million is principally comprised of foreign taxes on certain income earned by our foreign entities  state income taxes reduced by a refund of previously paid federal alternative minimum taxes and a reversal of previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits 
on november   the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of was signed into law 
one of the provisions in such act allows a taxpayer  at the taxpayer s election  to carryback either its  or net operating losses   or years whereas  generally  net operating losses can only be carried back up to years 
these net operating loss carryback provisions allow for the recovery of previously paid federal alternative minimum taxes 
for fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of  consisting of a federal refundable credit  offset by state minimum taxes and foreign income taxes 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to our operating loss history and our uncertain expectation of future taxable income 
we review the realization of these deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
any release of the valuation allowance would have a favorable impact on the provision for income taxes within our statement of operations 
net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 
the net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was income of  in fiscal compared to a loss of  in fiscal fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of the global economic slowdown 
the decrease in net sales of million in fiscal compared to fiscal was principally due to a significant decrease in dram revenue which was primarily the result of a decrease in unit shipments of our dram products and to a lesser extent a decline in average selling prices of such products 
in addition  unit shipments of our sram products decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal which contributed to the decline in our sram sales 
a change in product mix for our application specific standard products assp resulted in a decrease in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal for such products 
in fiscal  revenue recognized for one distributor accounted for of our net sales 
in fiscal  no single customer accounted for over of our net sales

our gross margin for fiscal and fiscal benefited from the sale of million and million  respectively  of products previously written down to zero carrying value 
our gross margin increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of a 
table of contents shift in our product mix to higher margin sram and focus dram products from lower margin commodity dram products 
in addition  our gross margins in fiscal were positively affected by a higher proportion of total revenue from products that were previously written down to lower of cost or market 
the decrease in our gross profit in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily a result of a decrease in unit shipments for our dram products and sram products 
in addition  our gross profit for fiscal benefited from approximately million of revenue for a dram development project 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in research and development expenses of million can be attributed to a decrease in testing fees and other product development costs partially offset by an increase in headcount related expenses associated with our acquisition of enable and the addition of a new design team in taiwan 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of million was attributable to a reduction in sales commission in fiscal as a result of our lower revenue  decreases in payroll and other expenses as a result of our cost reduction measures  and expenses incurred in fiscal related to our million stock repurchase 
acquired in process technology charge ipr d 
in fiscal  we incurred a million ipr d charge in connection with our acquisition of enable 
the million allocated to ipr d was expensed in fiscal as it was deemed to have no future alternative use

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 
the net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was a loss of  in fiscal compared to a income of  in fiscal 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of september   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
during fiscal  operating activities provided cash of approximately million compared to million provided in fiscal the cash provided by operations in fiscal was primarily due to our net income of million adjusted for non cash items of million  increases in accounts payable of million and increases in accrued liabilities of million 
this was offset by increases in inventory of million  increases in accounts receivable of million  million for long term deposits to secure foundry capacity and increases in other assets of million 
the cash provided by operations in fiscal was primarily due to decreases in inventories of million  decreases in accounts receivable of million  decreases in other assets of million and our net loss of million adjusted for non cash items of million 
these items were offset by decreases in accounts payable of million and decreases in accrued liabilities of million 
in fiscal  we generated million from investing activities compared to million used for investing activities in fiscal in fiscal  we generated million from the sale of trading securities  million from the net sales of available for sale securities and generated approximately million from the sale of shares of ralink 
we also received approximately million from the third party investors in our consolidated subsidiary giantec 
in the fiscal  we used million to collateralize accounts payable to a supplier 
in fiscal  we used approximately million for our acquisition of enable which was comprised of cash used for the purchase of enable shares less cash acquired as a result of our consolidation of enable and million for net purchases of available for sale securities 
in fiscal  we received proceeds of approximately million from the third party investors in our consolidated subsidiary wintram inc in fiscal  we made capital expenditures of approximately million for test equipment  engineering tools  and computer software and hardware compared to million in fiscal we expect to spend approximately million to million to purchase capital equipment during the next twelve months  principally for the purchase of additional test equipment  design and engineering tools  and computer hardware 
we expect to fund our capital expenditures from our existing cash and cash equivalent balances 
we generated million from financing activities during fiscal compared to million used in fiscal our source of financing for fiscal was proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million from stock option exercises and sales under our employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  we used million for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock 
in fiscal  we used million for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock and million for the repayment of short term borrowings 
our sources of financing in fiscal were borrowings of million under lines of credit and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million from stock option exercises and sales under our employee stock purchase plan 
we have million available through a number of short term lines of credit with various financial institutions in taiwan 
these lines of credit expire at various times through april as of september   we had no outstanding borrowings under these short term lines of credit 
we lease approximately  square feet of office space in san jose for our headquarters and the lease on this building expires in june outside of the us  we have operations in leased sites in china and hong kong 
in addition to these sites  we lease sales offices in the us  europe and asia 
these leases expire at various dates through in taiwan  we own and occupy our building and the land upon which our building is situated is leased under an operating lease that expires in march our outstanding commitments under these leases were approximately million at september  we generally warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of months 
liability for a stated warranty period is usually limited to the replacement of defective items or return of amounts paid 
warranty expense has historically been immaterial to our financial statements 

table of contents our contractual cash obligations at september  are outlined in the table below payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases purchase obligations with wafer foundries total contractual cash obligations at september   we had outstanding authorization from our board to purchase up to million of our common stock from time to time 
in october  our board authorized an additional million for the repurchase of our common stock from time to time 
we believe our existing funds will satisfy our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next months 
we may from time to time take actions to further increase our cash position through equity or debt financings  sales of shares of investments  bank borrowings  or the disposition of certain assets 
from time to time  we may also commit to acquisitions or equity investments  including strategic investments in or prepayments to wafer fabrication foundries or assembly and test subcontractors 
to the extent we enter into such transactions  any such transaction could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing to fund such activities 
there can be no assurance that any such additional financing could be obtained on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make difficult and subjective estimates  judgments and assumptions 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience combined with knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future  considering the information available at the time 
actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we reevaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
our critical accounting policies which are impacted by our estimates are i the valuation of our inventory  which impacts cost of goods sold and gross profit  ii the valuation of our allowance for sales returns and allowances  which impacts net sales  iii the valuation of our allowance for doubtful accounts  which impacts general and administrative expense  iv accounting for acquisitions and goodwill  which impacts operating expense when we record impairments and v accounting for stock based compensation which impacts costs of goods sold  research and development expense and selling  general and administrative expense 
each of these policies is described in more detail below 
we also have other key accounting policies that may not require us to make estimates and judgments that are as subjective or difficult 
for instance  our policies with regard to revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues on sales to distributors with sales price rebates and product return privileges 
these policies are described in the notes to our financial statements contained elsewhere in this report on form k 

table of contents valuation of inventory 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
determining the market value of inventories on hand and at distributors as of the balance sheet date involves numerous judgments  including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories 
when market values are below our costs  we record a charge to cost of goods sold to write down our inventories to their estimated market value in advance of when the inventories are actually sold 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that may adversely affect our operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  we may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
in addition to lower of cost or market write downs  we also analyze inventory to determine whether any of it is excess  obsolete or defective 
we write down to zero dollars which is a charge to cost of goods sold the carrying value of inventory on hand that has aged over one year to cover estimated excess and obsolete exposures  unless adjustments are made based on management s judgments for newer products  end of life products  planned inventory increases or strategic customer supply 
in making such judgments to write down inventory  we take into account the product life cycles which can range from six to months  the stage in the life cycle of the product  and the impact of competitors announcements and product introductions on our products 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent 
valuation of allowance for sales returns and allowances 
net sales consist principally of total product sales less estimated sales returns and allowances 
to estimate sales returns and allowances  we analyze potential customer specific product application issues  potential quality and reliability issues and historical returns 
we evaluate quarterly the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns and allowances 
this allowance is reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
increases to the allowance are recorded as a reduction to net sales 
because the allowance for sales returns and allowances is based on our judgments and estimates  particularly as to product application  quality and reliability issues  our allowances may not be adequate to cover actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our allowances are not adequate  our net sales could be adversely affected 
valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments for goods and services purchased from us 
we make our estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
once an account is deemed unlikely to be fully collected  we write down the carrying value of the receivable to the estimated recoverable value  which results in a charge to general and administrative expense  which decreases our profitability 
accounting for acquisitions and goodwill 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase accounting method 
under this method  the total consideration paid is allocated over the fair value of the net assets acquired  including in process research and development  with any excess allocated to goodwill 
goodwill is defined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value allocated to the net assets 
our judgments as to fair value of the assets will  therefore  affect the amount of goodwill that we record 
management is responsible for the valuation of tangible and intangible assets 
for tangible assets acquired in any acquisition  such as plant and equipment  the useful lives are estimated by considering comparable lives of similar assets  past history  the intended use of the assets and their condition 
in estimating the useful life of the acquired intangible assets with definite lives  we consider the industry environment and unique factors relating to each product relative to our business strategy and the likelihood of technological obsolescence 
acquired intangible assets primarily include core and current technology  customer relationships and customer contracts 
we are currently amortizing our acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods generally ranging from six months to six years 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances where indicators of impairment may exist 
for instance  in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill 

table of contents accounting for stock based compensation 
stock option fair value is calculated on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model 
the compensation cost is then recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the option  which is generally the option vesting term of four years 
we use the black scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant 
the black scholes valuation model requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected term  volatility  dividend yield and risk free interest rates that determine the stock option fair value 
in addition  we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant 
in subsequent periods  if actual forfeitures differ from the estimate  the forfeiture rate may be revised 
we estimate our expected forfeitures rate based on our historical activity and judgment regarding trends 
we estimate the expected term for option grants based upon historical exercise data 
if we determined that another method used to estimate expected life was more reasonable than our current method  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions was prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value calculated could change materially 
impact of recently issued accounting standards during fiscal  we adopted the following accounting standards  none of which had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations during such period or financial condition at the end of such period business combinations in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that establishes principles and requirements for determining how a company recognizes and measures the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination  including noncontrolling interests  contingent consideration  and certain acquired contingencies 
the guidance on business combinations also requires acquisition related transaction expenses and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized 
noncontrolling interest minority interest in december and january  the fasb issued guidance on the accounting and reporting for a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary 
we are required to report our noncontrolling interests as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we are also required to present net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to our stockholders separately in our consolidated statements of operations 
fair value disclosure in january  the fasb amended the disclosure requirements for the fair value measurements for recurring and nonrecurring non financial assets and liabilities 
these disclosure requirements are effective in two phases 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we adopted the requirements for disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value as well as disclosures about significant transfers 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  these amended accounting standards will require presentation of disaggregated activity within the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs relating to level measurements 
we do not anticipate that the additional disclosure requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our consolidated revenue 
our international sales are largely denominated in us dollars and therefore are not subject to material foreign currency exchange risk 
however  we have operations in china  europe  taiwan  hong kong  india  japan  korea and singapore where our expenses are denominated in each country s local currency and are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
in fiscal  we recorded exchange gains of approximately million 
in fiscal  we recorded exchange losses of approximately million 
we could be negatively impacted by exchange rate fluctuations in the future 
we do not currently engage in any hedging activities 
in the future  if we feel our foreign currency exposure has increased  we may consider entering into hedging transactions to help mitigate that risk 
interest rate risk 
we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of million at september  these funds were primarily invested in money market funds and certificates of deposit 
due to the relatively short term nature of our investment portfolio  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
we believe a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
since we believe we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
investments in publicly traded companies 
we own ordinary shares in smic which has been a publicly traded company since march our investment in smic is classified as an available for sale investment and is recorded at fair value with the unrealized gain or loss reported as a component in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
the cost basis of our shares in smic is approximately million and the market value at september  was approximately million and is included in short term investments 
the market value of smic shares is subject to fluctuations and our carrying value will be subject to adjustments to reflect changes in smic s market value in future periods 
the fair value of our smic stock would be approximately million or million  respectively  based on a hypothetical percent increase or percent decrease in smic s stock price 
in the event the decline in the market value of our smic shares below our cost basis is determined to be other than temporary  we would be required to recognize a loss on our investment through operating results
