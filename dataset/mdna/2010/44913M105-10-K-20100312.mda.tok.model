the objective of the business review was to create a plan to improve profitability and customer relations  transition more rapidly to bit technology products  rationalize operations and reorganize our corporate structure 
as a result of this business review  we recorded charges of million to costs of revenue and million to operating expenses during see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a presentation of certain of the above information on a quarterly basis for each of the four quarters in the years ended december  and 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following sets forth a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 
there are numerous references to the impact of foreign currency translation in the discussion of our results of operations 
over the past several years  the exchange rates between the us dollar and many foreign currencies  especially the euro  have fluctuated significantly 
when stronger us dollar exchange rates of the current year are used to translate the results of operations of the subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies  the resulting impact is a decrease in us dollars of reported results as compared with the prior period 
when the us dollar weakens  the resulting impact is an increase in us dollars of reported results as compared with the prior period 
during we committed to a plan to divest a european leasing and service operation and are currently marketing it for sale 
the results of this operation have been excluded from all continuing operating results included in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate past judgments and our estimates  including those related to bad debts  product returns  long term contracts  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  foreign currency  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reaso nable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our goodwill at least annually and at any other time if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
our long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in evaluating our long lived assets for recoverability  we use estimates of undiscounted future cash flows of our individual reporting units and for goodwill our recoverability is measured by reference to fair value using after tax discounted cash flows 
as quoted market prices are unavailable for our individual reporting units  fair value was determined through the use of estimated future cash flows 
the estimated cash flows used to assess recoverability of our long lived assets and measure fair value of our reporting units were derived from current business plans developed using near term and long term management projections 
our asset impairment evaluations  including our annual goodwill impairment test  required us to make several assumptions in determining estimates of future cash flows to determine fair value of our individual repo rting units  including near and long term revenue and cost assumptions 
we believe future events that could result in additional impairment of our goodwill and long lived assets include  but are not limited to  declines in the current economic environment or significant losses of our customer base in europe or in australia 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery of the products or services has occurred  c the selling price is both fixed and determinable  and d collectability is reasonably assured 
we generally recognize products revenues  including sales to distributors and sales under sales type leases  upon shipment of product 
we recognize services revenues as services are provided and collection of invoiced amounts is reasonably assured 
routine recurring services include terminal repairs  help desk  on site technician visits  deployment and the provision of supplies 
amounts received in advance of services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue 
revenues from long term contracts that require substantial performance of customized software and hardware over an extended period are recorded based upon the attainment of scheduled substantive performance milestones under the percentage of completion method 
operating lease revenue is recognized monthly over the lease term 
the units leased under operating leases are includ ed in the balance sheet under property  plant and equipment 
we accrue for warranty costs  sales returns and other allowances at the time revenue is recognized 
revenue from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis 
amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value  such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately or based on competitor prices for similar product or services 
we present revenues net of sales taxes and value added taxes in our consolidated statement of operations 
sales type leases certain product sales made under lease arrangement are recorded as sales type lease 
lease contract receivables represent the total lease payments to be received reduced by lease payments already collected 
sales type lease revenues consist of the initial sale of the product shipped and the interest and maintenance elements of the lease payments as they are earned 
an allowance for estimated uncollectible sales type lease receivables at an amount sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in our sales type lease portfolio is recorded 
the allowance is determined principally on the basis of historical loss experience and management s assessment of the credit quality of the sales type lease customer base 
if loss rates increase or customer credit conditions deteriorate  the allowance for uncollectible sales type leases may need to be increased 
unearned income includes interest and is the amount by which the original sum of the lease contract receivable exceeds the fair value of the equipment sold 
interest element is amortized to lease income using the effective interest method 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period for the fair value of stock options and related awards 
for stock options with graded vesting terms  we recognize compensation cost over the requisite service period using the accelerated method 
the fair value of our stock based awards is estimated at the date of grant using key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free interest rates and the expected dividend yield 
in addition  we estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a further discussion of stock based compensation 
product warranty we accrue for estimated warranty obligations when revenue is recognized based on an estimate of future warranty costs for delivered products and specific known product issues 
such estimates are based on historical experience and expectations of future costs 
we periodically evaluate and adjust the accrued warranty costs to the extent actual warranty costs vary from the original estimates 
our warranty period typically extends from one to five years from the date of shipment 
costs associated with maintenance contracts  including extended warranty contracts  are expensed when they are incurred 
actual warranty costs may differ from management s estimates 

table of contents legal and other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  intellectual property rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against us  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is estimable 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  if actual or estimated probable fut ure losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
for components not yet billed to us by our third party contract manufacturers  contingent liabilities are recorded by component based on the likelihood of our ultimate usage of the components 
costs associated with exit activities we record costs associated with exit activities such as for employee termination benefits that represent a one time benefit when management approves and commits to a plan of termination  and communicates the termination arrangement to the employees  or over the future service period  if any 
other costs associated with exit activities may include contract termination costs  including costs related to leased facilities to be abandoned or subleased  and facility and employee relocation costs 
in addition  a portion of our restructuring costs are outside the us related to expected employees terminations 
we are required to record a liability for this cost when it is probable that we will incur the costs and can reasonably estimate the amount 
in addition  we account for costs to exit an activity of an acquired company and involuntary employee termination benefits associated with acquired businesses in the purchase price allocation of the acquired business if a plan to exit an activity of an acquired company exists  and those costs have no future economic benefit to us and will be incurred as a direct result of the exit plan 
foreign currency assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the us with a functional currency other than us dollars are translated into us dollars using year end exchange rates 
revenue  costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year 
foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
for subsidiaries operating outside the us where the functional currency is us dollars  monetary assets and liabilities denominated in local currency are remeasured at year end exchange rates whereas non monetary assets  including inventories and property  plant and equipment  are reflected at historical rates 
revenue  costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year 
any gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in foreign currency loss on our consolidated statements of operation 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax laws including rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding the valuation reserve against our deferred tax assets 
we do not provide for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries because earnings are reinvested and  in the opinion of management  will continue to be reinvested indefinitely 

table of contents impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
overview of financial results the following overview highlights certain key events and factors impacting our financial performance for the year ended december  during  our primary objectives were i finalizing the integration of tet  ii continuing our margin expansion through operational efficiencies  iii strengthening our liquidity  and iv expanding our market share through focus on certain geographies and specific product lines and services 
the tet integration is substantially complete 
the information technology infrastructure and administrative functions are consolidated and operate under one enterprise resource planning system and we have made significant progress in the convergence of our product lines 
although the integration is substantially complete  we expect that our ability to offer common product offerings to all of our customers will continue to evolve  and therefore the benefits are not yet fully reflected in the financial results 
we expect continued improvement in our gross margin in since these synergies will be in effect for the full year  and due to cost reductions from our restructuring of research and development in europe to other regions 
our integration of tet has allowed us to maintain our market share i n european countries 
also during  we announced our intention to form a new venture with the mcdonnell group  phoenix managed networks  llc  which equips payment processors  banks and retailers worldwide with highly reliable and cost effective data communications services for transaction based applications 
this transaction was completed in february we believe that the combination of our existing hbnet business and with the expertise provided by the mcdonnell group  will enhance our ability to expand market share and deliver strong returns for our investors and business partners 
during  we committed to a plan to divest a european leasing and service operation and are currently marketing it for sale 
the results of this operation have been excluded from all continuing operating results included in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
net revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease over the year ended december  the primary reasons for the decrease were the following i reduced demand in our countertop and pin pad products in the americas and asia pacific  ii our exit of a marginally profitable service contract with a large customer in brazil during the third quarter of  and iii lower foreign currency exchange rates on foreign denominated revenue primarily in europe 
these factors were offset by new brazil products revenues and incremental revenues from the acquisition of tet  which was not included in our results for the first quarter of since the acquisition occurred on april  gross profit for the year ended december  was million or of revenue  compared to million or of revenue for the year ended december  gross margin  net of amortization of purchased intangible assets  for the year ended december  includes a product gross margin and a service gross margin  compared to product and service gross margins of and  respectively  for the same period in the increase in product gross margin was due to improved contract manufacturing pricing  a favorable product mix selling higher margin networking and unattended products  as well as the lack of transition costs for our move to third party manufacturing during  compared to the increase in service gross margin is a result of primarily hi gher margin services revenues in europe from the tet acquisition and the exit of a marginally profitable to million annual revenue service contract in brazil during the third quarter of during  we recorded a net loss of million or per share  which was a significant improvement over our results where we incurred a net loss of million or per share 
the net loss was principally due to our results during the first quarter in which we reported a net loss of million 
the first quarter was negatively impacted by the global economic downturn and the corresponding decrease in available credit to both businesses and consumers  as well as a general retail slowdown in the americas 

table of contents in  we incurred employee severance and related charges as a result of the following initiatives reorganization of our service businesses in australia and brazil  consolidation of our united kingdom operations in the salisbury facility  resulting in the closing of the woking facility  reorganization of our operations in asia pacific  reorganization of our management team in our offices in arizona  mexico and the caribbean  and reorganization of our research and development activities in europe 
as a result of these actions  we incurred charges of million in of the million  million was recorded in costs of revenue and million was recorded in operating expenses 
we expect to pay the remaining million associated with the employee severance and benefits related charges in we also expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately million in as a result of these initiatives 
while we believe our results in are due to the challenging global economic conditions  our results for the last three quarters of demonstrate that we have made progress by expanding our customer base  improving our margins and profitability  and generating significant cash flow 
we continue to see signs of improvement in the global economy 
although we see competitive pressures on a global basis  as we and our major competitors try to maintain and expand our respective market shares  we expect to continue to gain market share with our optimum product line 
these pressures will generally serve to decrease average prices for certain products within certain geographies for the foreseeable future 
we are tightly controlling operating expenses and continuing to improve our supply chain  while remaining focused on delivering the h ighest security and first class quality solutions to our customers 
as part of our effort to improve gross margin  we intend to move to a joint development manufacturing model where we will provide hardware specifications to a third party to design  develop and manufacture certain hardware 
we will continue to develop our software to the highest level of security and compliance 
we will also manage our balance sheet and leverage our working capital to help meet the objectives of our key initiatives in light of the current global economic environment

table of contents during the second quarter of  we completed the acquisition of tet for approximately to fund the acquisition  on february   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with francisco partners 
the credit agreement provided for a loan of up to million to partially fund the acquisition at closing 
the loan under the credit agreement bears interest at per annum  provided that  at our election  interest may be capitalized and added to the principal of the loan to be repaid at maturity 
the loan was funded by an affiliate of francisco partners  fp hypercom holdco  llc the lender 
all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement are due march  based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity  including borrowings available under our revolving credit facility or other financing options  will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  commitments  and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations and our tet acquisition debt requirement through the next year 
should operating results prove unfavorable  we may need to obtain additional capital sources to meet our short term liquidity and capital resource requirements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods dollars in thousands less than after total year years years years long term debt operating leases minimum purchase obligations total minimum purchase obligations include all outstanding obligations to purchase goods or services from our contract manufacturers and other suppliers at december  including agreements that are cancelable without penalty and agreements that are enforceable and legally binding 
we estimate that approximately of the outstanding purchase obligations at december  are non cancelable due to the customized nature of the order and the long lead time requirements 
our long term debt obligation includes principal and accrued interest through the maturity of the debt in off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
outlook we believe that our initiatives will improve our financial performance in we expect revenues to grow while continuing to control existing operating expenses 
beginning in the second quarter of  we anticipate releasing our next generation products using a joint development manufacturing model and over time we expect to increase product gross margin as revenue from these products become meaningful to our overall revenue 
we also expect our gross margin to improve as the overall economy improves and our markets continue to recover 
we are also in the process of restructuring our existing service businesses to increase service gross margin and we also intend to expand our software solutions to grow revenue and increase service gross margin 
in order t o increase the software related resources to support higher software and solutions revenue while also controlling operating expenses  beginning in the fourth quarter of  we opened a new low cost research and development center in the philippines and we intend to employ up to developers there by the end of 
table of contents we expect to continue to see competitive pressures on a global basis as we try to maintain and expand our market share 
these pressures will generally serve to decrease average selling prices for certain products within certain geographies we will continue to manage our balance sheet and leverage our working capital to help achieve of our key initiatives and in response to the global economic environment in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our cash equivalent investments are primarily in money market accounts and certificates of deposit and are reflected as cash equivalents because all maturities are within days from date of purchase 
our interest rate risk with respect to existing investments is limited due to the short term duration of these arrangements and the yields earned  which approximate current interest rates for similar investments 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our international operations and markets 
nevertheless  the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  due primarily to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
a substantial portion of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in either us dollars or euros 
however  we do at times enter into transactions in other currencies  such as the hong kong dollar  australian dollar  brazilian real  british pound and other central and south american  asian and european currencies 
in march  we suspended hedging activities due to the cost of entering into forward contracts  the possible short term cash requirements for forward contract payables  along with the inability to repatriate cash from foreign countries on a short term basis to offset any hedge forward contract payable 
we are currently reviewing our hedging strategy for prior to our decision to suspend hedging in march  we hedged the translation of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries in an attempt to neutralize the ef fect of translation gains or losses in the statement of operations 
we also entered into hedge contracts to mitigate certain significant transactional exposures 
financial hedging instruments were limited by our previous policy regarding foreign currency forward or option contracts and foreign currency debt 
at december   we had no foreign currency forward contracts 
we do not purchase or hold any such derivative financial instruments for the purpose of speculation or arbitrage 
see item a  risk factors international operations pose additional challenges and risks that if not properly managed could adversely affect our financial results elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
at present  all of our long term debt obligations are at a fixed interest rate over the term of the agreement and there are no borrowings under our revolving credit facility at december  during the normal course of business  we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations  as we discuss in this item a  and collectability of accounts receivable 
we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future
