overview the company s sales and operating income were substantially better than corresponding results despite the weak economy and essentially flat end markets 
in fiscal  the company continued to experience downward trends in its primary end markets  residential remodeling activity and housing starts  resulting in a decline in sales and overall operating income compared to housing starts have declined significantly in recent years from record highs in fiscal of over million to million in  million in  million in and million in fiscal and fiscal these market drivers were down approximately in fiscal compared to and were essentially flat at an estimated increase on a combined basis in fiscal compared to while the condition of the company s primary end markets remain historically weak  the company continues to demonstrate an ability to outperform the market by developing new products  securing price realization  and from the benefits of longstanding relationships with leading customers who the company believes continued to grow share 
additionally  the aluminum sheet products business benefited in from inventory re building  industry capacity reductions and market share gains in following a weak all of these factors  coupled with a continuous focus on controllable internal factors and the financial position of the company  resulted in the company not only performing relatively well in difficult times  but positioning it to gain additional market share even as end market conditions remain difficult

table of contents end market conditions in the first half of fiscal year were extremely difficult  driven by the collapse of the housing market along with a collapse of aluminum prices to an inflation adjusted record low 
with markets still depressed  the company saw a sales improvement in the second half of due to a better than expected seasonal pickup in the building season 
despite the difficult economic challenges in and its resulting pressure on sales volume  quanex produced respectable cash generation in  the result of significant improvements in working capital  a focus on cost controls  lean initiatives and price realization 
in  each quarter s sales were higher than the comparative quarter 
the company s net sales increased by million or in fiscal compared to fiscal quanex continued to not only keep  but win new business on the strength of its value proposition and solid execution 
additionally  the company s focus on price realization and vigilant focus on flexing the operations to demand are evident in its financial results and margins 
the strong performance at the aluminum sheet products segment contributed million to the net sales increase for the year as the segment experienced exceptionally strong shipments complimented by an increase in average selling prices 
the company believes that consumer demand for more energy efficient products and its ability to provide innovative window and door systems  in addition to stand alone components  along with its new sales and marketing efforts will help fuel its organic growth 
the company works closely with customers in all phases of product development  which is critical to increasing revenue and a significant factor for its success in this otherwise difficult period 
efforts are also ongoing to increase business in the repair and remodel segment of the residential market 
demographics for long term housing demand in the united states remain favorable when factoring the projected population increase and continuing immigration 
quanex began cross selling initiatives in that combine the best design  engineering and marketing talent within engineered products and announced project nexus in the company believes that taking a more disciplined approach to the way it seeks new business opportunities will make it a more successful company and a stronger competitor by offering a broader range of customers a more robust slate of systems  products and services 
the company is elevating its programs to develop more energy efficient products and introduced a product energycore that it believes is the most energy efficient window system on the market 
these programs and initiatives coupled with an eventual return to a more normal housing market will benefit the segment over the long term 
in addition to the negative market impact on the company s net sales and operating income  the company incurred impairments of its goodwill  and to a lesser extent  its other intangible assets in fiscal of million

the company s engineered products business outperformed the blended market in fiscal with net sales up in comparatively  the company s blended market drivers were essentially flat at an estimated increase on a combined basis in fiscal compared to the engineered products business experienced healthy growth  especially from remodeling activity  market share gains by customers and new products 
the growth this year further illustrates the logic of the segment s continued emphasis to gain share in the more active residential remodeling market 
the company continues to keep and win new business on the strength of the value proposition of its highly engineered window and door products 
the company believes that programs like the expired  first time homebuyers tax credit  the  tax credit for energy efficient windows  which expires at the end of december  and customer restocking in the first half of the year benefited results in as anticipated by the company  its demand slowed mid way through  which reflected the residential building and construction market peaking earlier in than is typical 
the decline in net sales at the engineered products segment in fiscal compared to is due to reduced volumes attributable to the fall off of housing starts and lower remodeling and repair expenditures 
partially offsetting the impact of the market fall off was targeted price increases that took effect across the segment in late and and the continued growth of new products and programs 
additionally  the company believes that the steady demand it saw during the fiscal fourth quarter of indicated that its customers continued to find success gaining share in the residential remodeling and replacement market  driven in part by the  tax credit for purchasing energy efficient replacement windows that began in exclusive of items shown separately below

the company took the necessary actions to right size its business by reducing variable and fixed costs and continuously sizes its operations to match demand 
net sales less cost of sales as a percent of net sales increased from fiscal to fiscal as a direct result of the company s right sizing efforts and price realization 
primarily as a result of the company s ability to right size to demand  along with price realization and growth in higher margin products  the margins for fiscal are the highest in the past five years even though housing starts in fiscal were less than a third of those in also  in the first fiscal quarter of  the company had hourly labor savings associated with the strike at the segment s barbourville  kentucky facility in mid december as the then effective labor contract expired without the parties having reached a new agreement 
in january  the strike ended upon ratification of a new three year collective bargaining agreement 
the barbourville facility was able to continue production with the company s non union salaried workforce and continued to deliver its products during the strike to meet customer demands 
since january  the barbourville plant has experienced some labor inefficiencies as they recover from the strike 
benefiting the comparative and results is an expense of million recorded in the fiscal related to a truseal warranty reserve increase driven by an increase in a legacy product s claims experience 
reducing margins in fiscal were costs associated with vacating a couple of buildings at the company s mikron facility in kent  washington and higher material costs at truseal 
this building consolidation will reduce operating costs beginning in fiscal at truseal  the business uses an oil based butyl compound in its insulating glass sealant systems  and with the rise in oil prices  margins were squeezed

also  variable pay incentives increased in corresponding to an increased level of earnings 
furthermore  the company is beginning to incur additional sales and marketing expenses associated with the roll out of new products and programs in this increase was partially offset by cost control efforts put in place in and the absence of matching contributions to the quanex building products salaried and non union employee k plan in the first quarter as that program was suspended as of april  the matching contributions on this k plan were reinstated effective february  the segment reduced its selling  general and administrative costs in fiscal compared to fiscal by million or 
this was achieved through various means including reduced headcount  less outside contract services  a continued emphasis on cost control for various programs and reduction in variable pay incentives corresponding to lower levels of earnings 
the company formally announced project nexus in february project nexus is the company s long term organic growth program that is focused on connecting the sales  marketing  and product development efforts of its engineered products operating divisions mikron  truseal and homeshield

the company s organic growth program is comprised of related initiatives to execute this strategy the sales  marketing and engineering efforts of these three divisions operated independently in the past 
today  the engineered products sales and marketing employees have been organized into a single team to better utilize their combined capabilities to expand sales opportunities to the existing customer base 
additionally  the new sales and marketing structure is focused on developing and capturing more regional oem opportunities 
regional oems  a customer class the company has historically underserved  are believed to comprise about of the market 
the engineering resources across engineered products are also working together to develop products and systems that provide customers with the latest innovations in technology and energy efficiency 
the company is in the early stages of this long term organic growth initiative but believes that it could have a valuable impact on the long term growth and profitability of engineered products

declines in aluminum prices generally result in spread compression  however  as aluminum prices rebound  spread and profits generally expand 
the increase in average lme aluminum prices in fiscal compared to fiscal of is the primary driver to the company s increase in spread 
however  spreads remained constrained in due to ongoing tightness in the aluminum scrap market  particularly in the availability of industrial grade scrap due to reduced industrial production 
nichols is essentially scrap driven  and it uses both clean industrial scrap as well as post consumer scrap in its mix  which while cheaper to purchase on a per pound basis  requires more processing before it s ready to melt

outlook fiscal as the company looks to  it does not expect another round of government sponsored incentives  so the industry is on its own 
programs like the expired  first time homebuyers tax credit  the  tax credit for energy efficient windows  which expires at the end of december  and customer restocking in the first half of the year helped results in with no catalyst to provide a surge in market activity  together with a large inventory of homes available for sale  the company expects a challenging environment in  with sales flat to slightly down from  along with tough quarter to quarter comparisons  particularly in the first half of the year 
while the company expects to outperform its end markets in  its operating plan is built on market assumptions that new construction window shipments will be flat to  while repair and replacement r r window shipments will be down 
the company s r r window estimate is significantly lower than the more commonly cited forecast that represents the broader r r market  as the company believes r r window activity has not recovered as quickly as the broader market  coupled with some demand pull forward effect of the  window tax credit that expires december  given the company s outlook  it expects engineered products in to earn about million of operating income  essentially flat to the company expects to see slightly higher sales for the segment in compared to because of ongoing r r share gains by its large window and door customers  and to a lesser extent  gains it will make with national and regional customers through its organic growth initiatives 
however  along with slightly better expected sales  the company will see higher operating expenses as it invests to expand its organic growth initiatives 
assuming a reasonable recovery in the housing market  the potential of these initiatives is expected to be about million of annualized sales in years  and while they will likely be back end loaded  would represent about growth above today s sales 
annual incremental operating expenses and capital expenditures necessary to achieve this growth will be approximately million and million  respectively in at aluminum sheet products  the company expects to earn about million of operating income in  compared to the million it earned in the million is based primarily on lower sales as the company does not expect to see the level of restocking activity that was present in the first half of repeated in the first half of the guidance is based on ongoing capacity constraints in the aluminum sheet market  a tight aluminum scrap market  and no material change in its value added product mix
