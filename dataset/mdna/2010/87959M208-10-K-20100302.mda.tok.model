item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview telik is engaged in the discovery and development of small molecule drugs 
our business strategy is to advance our product candidates through phase clinical studies  and to enter into a partnership with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company to assist in further development and commercialization  license product candidates outside our therapeutic focus  and identify and develop additional drug product candidates 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses for the next several years as we continue our research and development activities 
during the year ended december   loss from operations was million and net loss was million 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million and net cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted investments at december  were million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our expenses have consisted primarily of those incurred for research and development and general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
the process of carrying out the development of our product candidates to later stages of development and our research programs may require significant additional research and development expenditures  including for preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as for manufacturing development efforts and obtaining regulatory approval 
we outsource our clinical trials and our manufacturing development activities to third parties to maximize efficiency and minimize our internal overhead 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  and from non equity payments from collaborative partners 
we are subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory and marketing approvals  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  potential competition  use of hazardous materials and retention of key employees 
in order for a product to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate reimbursement from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
in february  we implemented a restructuring plan to further reduce our operating expenses and to streamline our infrastructure to focus on our most advanced preclinical and clinical development programs 
as a result of the restructuring plan we reduced our workforce by positions and recorded a charge of approximately million for the year ended december   which primarily includes employee severance  payroll taxes and other personnel related costs 
as a result of our restructuring plan  we believe our existing cash resources will be sufficient to satisfy our current operating plan until mid changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future consumption of existing cash resources as well 
in any event  we will require substantial additional financing to fund our operations in the future 
we expect that our quarterly and annual results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including the timing and extent of our research and development efforts and the outcome of our clinical trial activities 
the successful development of our products is uncertain 
as such  an accurate prediction of future operating results is difficult or impossible 

table of contents clinical product development telintra  our current drug product candidate in clinical development  is a small molecule glutathione analog inhibitor of the enzyme glutathione s transferase p we are developing telintra for the treatment of blood disorders associated with low blood cell levels  such as neutropenia or anemia 
in may  we initiated two phase clinical trials of telintra tablets  one for the treatment of patients with mds and the other for the treatment of cin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer receiving first line chemotherapy 
in the second quarter of  we initiated a phase randomized study in scn to determine the effect of telintra tablets on absolute neutrophil count in patients with this disease and we discontinued the trial for cin to focus resources on the development of telintra tablets in mds and hematologic malignancies 
the trial for mds completed enrollment of patients 
the trial for scn is intended to enroll a total of patients 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a phase dose ranging study of telintra tablets in combination with lenalidomide in patients with mds 
we expect to enroll up to patients for this study 
telcyta  our first product candidate  is a small molecule cancer drug product candidate designed to be activated in cancer cells 
telcyta has shown clinical antitumor activity alone and in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents in multiple phase clinical trials in refractory or resistant ovarian  non small cell lung  breast and colorectal cancer 
in addition  telcyta demonstrated clinical activity in two phase trials in combination regimens as first line treatment in patients with stage iiib or iv non small cell lung cancer 
we have completed multiple phase  phase and phase clinical trials with telcyta alone and in combination with standard chemotherapy drugs 
these trials were conducted in refractory ovarian and non small cell lung cancer 
the phase trials did not achieve their primary endpoints 
at the asco meeting in june  we reported results of the trial comparing treatment with doxil alone and telcyta plus doxil in platinum refractory ovarian cancer in which a sub set of patients with platinum refractory disease demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression free survival when treated with the combination containing telcyta as compared to doxil alone 
in addition  we published in a peer reviewed publication the results of a phase multicenter trial treating previously untreated lung cancer patients for the first time with carboplatin  paclitaxel and telcyta followed by telcyta maintenance that demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the group of patient undergoing telcyta maintenance 
we plan to seek a partnership with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company to advance the development and potential commercialization of telcyta 
preclinical drug product development tlk aurora kinase vegfr inhibitors we have a small molecule compound inhibiting both aurora kinase and vegfr kinase 
aurora kinase is a signaling enzyme whose function is required for cancer cell division  while vegf plays a key role in tumor blood vessel formation  ensuring an adequate supply of nutrients to support tumor growth 
the lead compounds of our first dual inhibitor program met a development milestone in august by demonstrating anticancer activity in preclinical models of human colon cancer and human leukemia 
these lead compounds prevented tumor growth in preclinical models of human colon cancer and human leukemia by inhibiting both aurora kinase and vegfr kinase 
our data support the concept that dual inhibition of aurora kinase and vegfr kinase represents a promising approach for anticancer therapy 
a development drug product candidate  tlk  has been selected 
we are conducting the required preclinical safety studies that if successful may support the potential filing of an ind application with the fda 
tlk antimitotic agent using our trap technology  we have discovered tlk  a novel  potent small molecule inhibitor of cell division 
tlk inhibits the formation of microtubules that are necessary for cancer cell growth leading 
table of contents to persistent cancer cell block and subsequent cell death at the g m cell cycle 
this compound demonstrates potent broad spectrum anticancer activity against a number of human cancer cells 
this compound also displays oral efficacy in multiple  standard preclinical models of cancer 
tlk is currently being evaluated in preclinical safety studies 
tlk vegfr inhibitor tlk is a small molecule dual inhibitor of vegfr and vegfr kinase 
vegfr kinases are known to mediate the formation of new blood vessels in human cancers allowing them to grow 
in standard animal models of human colon cancer  oral administration of tlk significantly reduced tumor growth 
tlk is undergoing further preclinical assessment 
tlk cytotoxic small molecule tlk is a novel metabolically activated cytotoxic small molecule 
tlk induces apoptosis and g m  or cell division  cell cycle arrest in a broad array of human cancer cell lines including those not expressing gst p it has shown significant antitumor activity in human breast  pancreatic  brain and colon tumors in preclinical models of human cancer when administered either orally or by injection 
other we terminated our agreements with sri international and receptorbio  inc in december and october  respectively 
we discovered all of our drug product candidates using our proprietary technology  trap  which we believe enables the rapid and efficient discovery of small molecule drug product candidates 
we expect to enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties  such as contract research organizations for clinical trials  development  manufacturing  regulatory approvals or commercialization of some of our products  particularly outside north america  or in disease areas requiring larger and longer clinical trials than cancer 
nasdaq stock listing compliance status on september   we received notification from nasdaq informing us that the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued inclusion on the nasdaq global market under nasdaq marketplace rule a and giving us days to regain compliance 
nasdaq subsequently implemented temporary suspensions of the minimum bid price requirement  allowing us until january  to regain compliance 
in december  we applied for a transfer of the listing of our common stock to the nasdaq capital market  as we met certain initial inclusion criteria 
on january   we received notice from the nasdaq listing qualifications department that our application to transfer listing of our common stock from the nasdaq global market to the nasdaq capital market had been approved 
the transfer was effective at the opening of the market on january  in accordance with listing rule c a  we now have an additional day period  or until july   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
ubs purchase rights and loan on november   we entered into an agreement with ubs ag and with its affiliates  or ubs  whereby we received rights  or the right  to sell all our auction rate securities  or ars  held in our ubs account at par value to ubs at any time during a two year period beginning on june  and ending on july  if we do not exercise the right  the ars will continue to accrue and pay interest as determined by the auction process or the terms specified in the prospectus of the ars if the auction process fails 
if the right is not exercised on or before july   it will expire and ubs will have no further obligation to buy our ars 
ubs is also granted the right to purchase or sell our ars at any time after acceptance of the agreement until july   so long as we receive par value for the ars 
the right is a nontransferable security registered with the sec 

table of contents in connection with our acceptance of the offer to enter into the agreement  ubs has made available to us no net cost loans for up to of the market value of our ars  where interest payable on the loan does not exceed interest earned on our ars 
the loan is secured by our ars 
on december   we borrowed million from ubs in accordance with such a secured  no net cost demand facility 
on june   ubs repurchased a portion of our ars under the rights agreement at par value of million 
proceeds of the sale of our ars were applied to repayment of the credit line leaving a balance of million as of december  for the year ended december   interest paid on the loan was approximately  which was fully offset by interest earned on the pledged securities 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition and clinical development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 
fair value measurements we invest our excess cash in money market funds  cash deposits  debt instruments of the us government agency securities  auction rate securities  or ars  and corporate notes 
in the current market environment  the assessment of the fair value of the debt securities can be difficult and subjective 
accounting standards codification  or asc   fair value measurements and disclosure  establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  and level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the determination of fair value for level instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 
we have used level assumptions to estimate our ars investments 
since the auctions for our ars have continued to fail  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value 
our ars are held by ubs  one of our investment providers 
on november   we accepted an offer  the right  from ubs entitling us to sell our auction rate securities originally purchased from ubs at par value at anytime during 
table of contents a two year period from june  through july  we value this put option using a discounted cash flow model based on level assumptions 
the assumptions used in valuing the ars and the put option include estimates of  based on data available as of december   interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  expected holding periods of the ars  loan rates per the ubs rights offering and bearer risk associated with ubs s financial ability to repurchase the ars beginning june  given the current market environment  these assumptions are volatile and subject to change  and therefore could result in significant changes to the fair value of ars 
we intend to exercise the right from ubs on june  and as a result has classified these ars as trading securities and recorded under short term investments as of december  see note to the financial statements for additional information 
stock based compensation expense we used the fair value method under asc  compensation stock compensation to account for share based payment awards following the modified prospective method of adoption which provided for certain changes to the method for valuing stock based compensation 
under asc  employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the employee stock award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period in a manner similar to other forms of compensation paid to employees 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of the award 
from january  to june   a blended rate of historical volatility and implied volatility was used to determine our expected stock price volatility since we had sufficient market activity existed with respect to our traded options during such period 
for the period from july  to december   the expected volatility was based solely on historical volatility as there was insufficient traded option activity resulting from our declining stock price 
the expected term of options granted is based on the simplified method in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  topic d  as our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis for estimation 
sab topic d was effective on january  and provided guidance to issuers on the method allowed in developing estimates of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with asc sab topic d allows companies to continue to use the simplified method  under certain circumstances  beyond december  asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we adjusted our forfeiture rate to reflect actual historical and expected cancellations of unvested options due to employee attrition 
we increased our forfeiture rates from in to in and see also note  stockholders equity  in the notes to financial statements for further information 
if factors change and we develop different assumptions in the application of asc in future periods  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses include salaries and benefits costs  fees for contractors  consultants and third party contract research organizations  and an allocation of facility and administrative costs 
research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for drug and product development  manufacturing  clinical activities  discovery research  screening and identification of product candidates  and preclinical studies 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
clinical development costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
we have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities on our behalf in the on going development of our product candidates 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiation and may vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
we accrue and expense costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed during a given period of time over the life of the individual study in accordance with agreements established with third 
table of contents party contract research organizations and clinical trial sites 
we determine our estimates through discussion with internal clinical personnel and third party service providers of the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services in each agreement 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the third party organizations as measured by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods 
conversely  over estimation of activity levels could result in accrued expenses being reversed in future periods 
use of estimates in preparing our financial statements to conform with gaap  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
results of operations revenues we had no collaborative research agreements in  and and currently do not expect to record any revenue in the next twelve months 
future non product revenues  if any  will depend upon the extent to which we enter into new collaborative research agreements and the amounts of payments relating to such agreements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million 
our research and development activities consist primarily of drug development  clinical supply manufacturing  clinical activities  discovery research  screening and identification of product candidates and preclinical studies 
we group these activities into two major categories research and preclinical and clinical development 
the costs associated with research and preclinical and clinical development activities approximate the following years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages research and preclinical clinical development total research and development total research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or million  compared to the same period in primarily due to the following decreased costs of approximately million in connection with headcount reduction as a result of our february restructuring and reduced research activities  lower stock based compensation expense of approximately million primarily due to lower headcount associated with fewer outstanding options vested  reduced expenses of approximately million as phase clinical trial study activities in our assist  assist  assist and assist were completed  
table of contents decreased costs of approximately  as our telcyta phase combination trials in ovarian and lung cancer were completed and approximately  due to completion of phase a telintra oral formulation clinical trials for mds 
these reductions were offset by increased expenses of approximately million for ongoing phase clinical trials of telintra tablets  and increased expenses of approximately  for tlk cytotoxic small molecule and tlk aurora kinase preclinical development programs 
stock based compensation expense included in research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were  and million 
total research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or million  compared to the same period in primarily due to the following reduction of approximately million as phase clinical trial study activities in our assist  assist  assist and assist were completed  corresponding decreased costs in our clinical drug supply manufacturing cost of approximately million  decreased costs of approximately million in connection with headcount reduction associated with reduced clinical activities  and lower stock based compensation expense of approximately million primarily due to complete vesting of higher value stock options granted in earlier periods 
stock based compensation expense included in research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million 
we expect total research and development expenditures to continue to decrease in the next twelve months as we focus on the phase clinical trials of telintra tablets and advance new drug product candidates into the clinic 
specifically  future headcount expenses will be lower due to the restructuring completed in and we expect both clinical and manufacturing expenditures to be lower than previous years as all remaining close out expenses associated with our phase trials have been accounted for 
the following table summarizes our principal drug product candidate development initiatives related r d expenses years ended december  product in thousands telintra telcyta tlk tlk other total research and development expenses other constitutes research and development activities performed by our chemistry  biology  preclinical and quality assurance departments as these costs cannot be allocated to any individual project 

table of contents the largest component of our total operating expenses is our on going investment in our research and development activities and  in particular  the clinical development of our product candidate pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  filing with the fda of an ind  to conduct initial human clinical trials for drug candidates  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate  and filing by company and acceptance and approval by the fda of a nda for a product candidate to allow commercial distribution of the drug 
in view of the factors mentioned above  we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
due to these and other factors  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments or the future cash inflows from these programs 
general and administrative expenses years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages general and administrative the increase in general and administrative expenses of  or  in compared to the same period in was primarily due to increased legal and professional service expenses of approximately  related to corporate matters and business development activities and increased allocation of facility related expenses of approximately million 
the increase was partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense of approximately  as a result of lower fair values of options vested and a decrease of approximately  in expenses related primarily to lower insurance expenses 
stock based compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses of  or million in compared to the same period in was primarily due to approximately million associated with headcount reduction and related administrative expenses 
in addition  legal expenses decreased by approximately million primarily due to the completion of our class action lawsuit defense and reduced patent application expenses 
stock based compensation expense also decreased by approximately million primarily due to complete vesting of higher value stock options granted in earlier periods 
stock based compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million 
we expect future general and administrative expenses to be lower than the spending level as we undertake efforts to control expenses 

table of contents restructuring costs years ended december  in thousands restructuring costs in february  we implemented a restructuring plan and reduced our workforce by positions and recorded a charge of approximately  we paid  in the quarter ended march    in the quarter ended june  and  in the quarter ended september  as severance  payroll taxes and other personnel related costs 
in september  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  for severance costs and health benefits charges relating to a workforce reduction of seven positions 
in february  we reduced our workforce by positions  or approximately of our workforce  and recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million for severance costs and other charges in the quarter ended march  interest income and interest expense years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages interest and other income expense  net interest expense n a interest and other income expense  net of  million and million for the years ended december   and resulted primarily from earnings on investments 
the decrease of approximately million in compared to the same period in was due primarily to a decrease of million in investment income resulting from lower investment cash balances and lower interest rates 
in addition  the year ended december  included a gain of million from the ars right offered by ubs which largely offset the losses recorded on our ars due to reclassification of these securities from available for sale to trading of approximately million while there was no such adjustment in the decrease for was further offset by a  gain on the sale of computer and laboratory equipment 
the decrease of approximately million in compared to the same period in was due to a million decrease in investment income as a result of lower investment cash balances and lower interest rates  an increase in write down expenses of approximately million for investments in ars due to changes in market conditions resulting in an other than temporary impairment which was offset by a gain of million from the ars right offered by ubs 
interest expense for the year ended december  of  was for interest payments on our ubs loan 
there was no interest expense for the year ended december  as our lease and loan obligations were fully paid off at december  interest expense in was for interest associated with a buy out option on leased equipment 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources in millions  except ratios december cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash working capital current ratio year ended december cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above sources and uses of cash 
due to the significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products to generate revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since we incorporated in as such  we have funded our research and development operations through sales of equity  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners  interest earned on investments and equipment lease financings 
at december  we had available cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted investments of million 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including obligations of us government agencies  high grade corporate and municipal bonds  auction rate preferred securities and money market accounts 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
as of december   million par value of our investment portfolio was invested in corporate and municipal notes investments with an auction reset feature in the form of auction rate certificates and auction preferred stock  collectively known as auction rate securities  or ars 
historically  the fair value of ars investments approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
beginning in late  our securities invested in ars failed to settle in scheduled auctions due to liquidity crises 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not make the sale  but does not result in the securities going into default because the issuer continues to pay interest 
these investments are not liquid and their carrying amounts are impaired due to the adverse change in the corporate debt market 
as a result  we have written down the carrying amount of these investments and recognized a loss of approximately million through december  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record additional impairment charges on these investments 
on november   we entered into an agreement with ubs ag and its affiliates  or ubs  whereby we received rights to sell all our ars held in our ubs account at par value to ubs at any time during a two year period beginning on june  and ending on july  in connection with our acceptance of ubs offer to enter into that agreement  ubs made available to us no net cost loans  secured by our ars  for up to of the market value of our ars  where interest payable on the loan does not exceed interest earned on our ars 
on december   we borrowed million from ubs in accordance with such a secured  no net cost demand facility 
on june   ubs elected to purchase a portion of our ars under the rights agreement at par value of million 
proceeds of the sale of our ars were applied to repayment of the credit line leaving a balance of million as of december  
table of contents cash flows from operating activities 
cash used in operations for was million compared with million for the same period in and in net loss of million in included non cash charges of million for stock based compensation   for depreciation and amortization and million for the reduction in value of the put option associated with the ubs ars right and were partially offset by a million increase in the fair value of marketable securities and a  gain on the disposal of property and equipment 
cash used in operations was further impacted by a million reduction in accrued clinical trials related primarily to the completion of our phase clinical trials and a million decrease in accounts payable 
cash used in resulted from a net loss of million in included non cash charges of million for stock based compensation  for depreciation and amortization and million for the write down of marketable securities and were partially offset by a gain of million recorded upon initial recognition of a put option associated with the ars rights with ubs 
cash used in operations was further impacted by a million reduction in accrued clinical trials related primarily to the completion of our assist   and clinical trials and a million reduction in accrued legal and related expenses primarily for amounts paid in connection with the class action lawsuit  partially offset by a decrease of  in interest receivables as a result of lower interest rates and investment balances and a  increase in accounts payable 
cash used in resulted from a net loss of million which included non cash charges of million for stock based compensation  million for depreciation and amortization and million for the write down of marketable securities 
cash used in operations was further impacted by a million reduction in accrued clinical trials related primarily to the near completion of our assist  and clinical trials and a million reduction in accounts payable 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash used in investing activities for was million compared with cash provided by investing activities of million for and million for cash used in was primarily for the purchase of available for sale investments of million and was partially offset by  in investment sales  million in investment maturities and  in proceeds from the sale of property 
cash provided for was primarily from million in maturities of investments and million from sales of investments offset by million in purchases of available for sale investments 
cash provided in was primarily from million in maturities of investments and million from sales of investments partially offset by million in purchases of available for sale investments and  in purchases of laboratory equipment 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities for was approximately  compared to million in and  in financing activities for comprised of  in proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities in comprised of million in loan proceeds from ubs and  in proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities in comprised primarily of million in proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  offset by  in payments under capital leases and equipment loans 
working capital 
working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to our use of cash for telintra  tlk and tlk development programs  and our operating expenses 
as a result of our restructuring plan implemented in february  we believe our existing cash resources will be sufficient to satisfy our current operating plan until mid changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future consumption of existing cash resources as well 
in any event  we will require substantial additional financing to fund our operations in the future 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
debt financing may subject us to restrictive covenants that may adversely affect our operations 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through licensing arrangements or arrangements with collaborative partners  we may be required to relinquish  on terms 
table of contents that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress and success of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates  the progress and number of research programs in development  the costs associated with conducting phase clinical trials  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals  our ability to establish  and the scope of  any new collaborations  our ability to meet the milestones identified in our collaborative agreements that trigger payments  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual property rights  and competing technological and market developments 
we currently have no commitments for any additional financings 
if we need to raise additional money to fund our operations  funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to market our products as planned or continue development of our products  or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
our future contractual obligations at december  are as follows total after in thousands operating leases we have a contractual obligation under the terms of our manufacturing supply agreement with amri wherein we are obligated to purchase a majority of our united states requirements for the active ingredient in telcyta for a number of years 
however  we currently do not have any requirements for the active ingredient 
we have agreed on a pricing schedule for such supply  which will be subject to future renegotiation after a defined time period 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k a ii

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk exposure involves forward looking statements 
we do not use or hold derivative financial instruments  however we are exposed to market risk related to changes interest rates and market conditions 
our investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates we maintain investments of shorter maturities 
our marketable securities portfolio is primarily invested in corporate debt securities and commercial papers with an average maturity of under one year and a minimum investment grade rating of a or a or better to minimize credit risk 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments were sold prior to maturity 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
we have operated primarily in the united states and all funding activities with our collaborators to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not have any exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of stated maturity for our investment portfolio and beyond total fair value at december  in thousands  except percentages available for sale securities trading securities average interest rate trading securities are comprise of corporate securities  student loans and municipal notes investments with an auction reset feature in the form of auction rate certificates and auction preferred stock  collectively known as ars  held in our account with ubs 
as discussed previously  while we continue to earn interest on the ars  these investments are not liquid and their carrying amounts are impaired due to the adverse change in the debt market 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
in november  we entered into an agreement with ubs whereby we received the right to sell all our ars held in our ubs account at par value to ubs at any time during a two year period beginning on june  and ending on july  we intend to exercise this right and recover par value of the ars 
the value of the right largely offset the decline in fair value of the ars 
however  ubs obligations under the right are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the right 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the right 
if ubs has insufficient funding to buy back the ars and the auction process continues to fail  then we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the ars 
on december   we entered into a loan agreement with ubs and drew down million with our ars pledged as collateral 
the loan is treated as a no net cost loan as defined in the agreement  meaning that the loan will bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest paid or deemed paid to us on the pledged ars such that the interest cost  net of interest received by us on the pledged ars  will be zero 
on june   ubs elected to repurchase a portion of our ars under the right agreement at par value of million 
proceeds of the sale of our ars were applied to repayment of the credit line leaving a balance of million as of december  other than the ubs loan  there were no material changes to our market exposure risk since december
