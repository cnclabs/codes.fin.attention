we continually seek to expand our technology portfolio through internal development  co development with business partners and evaluation of acquisition opportunities 
historically  significant portions of our revenue have been generated by sales to a relatively small number of end customers and distributors 
we sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force  distributors and manufacturers representatives 
we sell to distributors in japan  taiwan  china  korea  europe  southeast asia and the u 
s  and our manufacturers representatives support some of our us  korean and european sales 
our distributors typically provide engineering support to our end customers and often have valuable and established relationships with our end customers 
in certain countries it is customary to sell to distributors 
while distributor payment to us is not dependent upon the distributor s ability to resell the product or to collect from the end customer  the distributors may provide longer payment terms to end customers than those we would offer 

table of contents significant portions of our products are sold overseas 
sales outside the us accounted for approximately  and of revenue in  and  respectively 
our integrators  branded manufacturers and branded suppliers incorporate our products into systems that are sold worldwide 
all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
factors affecting results of operations and financial condition general market conditions financial  commercial and consumer markets experienced significant disruption during the last quarter of and throughout and adversely affected our results of operations during we experienced a significant decrease in revenue during the first and second quarters of as consumer demand decreased and our customers reduced their inventory levels in response to general economic uncertainty and lack of visibility regarding expected future sales 
we responded to the economic downturn by initiating a restructuring plan in december to reduce our operating expenses by reducing operations  research and development and administrative headcount in our san jose  taiwan and china offices as well as implementing other cost reduction efforts  including company wide salary reductions during the second and third quarters of although the macroeconomic environment and our business appear to have stabilized during the second half of  consumer confidence and spending are still down significantly and we are unable to predict how the challenging global economic environment may impact our future results of operations and financial position 
restructuring plan initiated in november in november  we initiated a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses and continued to implement this plan throughout and as part of this plan we closed certain offices and consolidated our operations and research and development activities 
we also narrowed and redefined our product development strategy which resulted in the write off of intellectual property ip assets  tooling  software development tools and charges for related non cancelable contracts 
this plan significantly decreased our expenses for compensation  software amortization and maintenance  equipment depreciation  information technology  facilities and stock compensation and was completed during the fourth quarter of accordingly  is the first year that fully reflects the cost reductions attributable to the plan initiated in november results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december   and year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue  net net revenue was as follows in thousands year ended december  v

net revenue decreased million  or  from to as the result of a decrease in units sold  partially offset by a increase in average selling price asp 
the decrease in units sold during compared to resulted primarily from weakened customer demand due to the worldwide economic downturn  particularly during the first half of decreased revenue also resulted from lower sales of our legacy products  including those we acquired in our acquisition of equator technologies  inc equator in june  and lower sales into markets which we no longer pursue 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of our motion estimation motion compensation memc co processor ics  and sales of our next generation projector image processors 

table of contents we did experience some recovery in revenue levels in the second half of compared to the first half of as the worldwide economy strengthened 
our most significant recovery was in digital projector market sales which were up slightly from the second half of to the second half of  compared with a decrease of from the first half of to the first half of revenue from our advanced television market  which includes the panel market and our memc co processor ics  was approximately flat from the second half of to the second half of  an improvement over the decrease from the first half of to the first half of our revenue from other markets did not experience a recovery during the second half of  compared to the second half of  primarily due to consistent decreases in sales of legacy products in markets which we no longer pursue 
v 
net revenue decreased million  or  from to as the result of a decrease in units sold  partially offset by a increase in asp 
the increase in asp from to was primarily the result of an increase in the percentage of total revenue from the digital projector market  which generally has higher asps than our other products 
the decrease in units sold during compared to resulted from decreases in revenue across all of our markets 
digital projector and advanced television market sales decreased due to a general weakening of the market  particularly during the fourth quarter of as our customers decreased their inventory levels due to macroeconomic uncertainty 
additionally  advanced television market sales decreased due to our decision to shift our focus away from the commoditized soc segment of the market to focus on our line of memc co processor ics 
sales of legacy products acquired in the equator acquisition also decreased as we discontinued our development efforts related to these parts and existing customers switched to next generation designs from other suppliers

v 
total cost of revenue increased to of revenue in from of revenue in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in direct product costs due to changes in the mix of products sold  including increased sales of our memc products and next generation projector processors and decreased sales of our legacy equator products 
gross profit margins also decreased due to the impact of lower overhead cost absorption due to decreased revenue without corresponding reductions in our fixed costs 
we expect future cost improvements on our memc products and next generation projector processors as we continue to ramp production and begin to realize production efficiencies  however we are unable to predict the timing and extent of these improvements 
additionally  our acquired developed technology asset will be fully amortized by june  and amortization of acquired intangible assets recorded in cost of goods sold is expected to decrease from million in to million in

research and development research and development expense includes compensation and related costs for personnel  development related expenses including non recurring engineering and fees for outside services  depreciation and amortization  expensed equipment  facilities and information technology expense allocations and travel and related expenses 
as further described below  we reduced our research and development expense significantly during and as the result of restructuring plans initiated in november and december as part of these restructuring plans and other on going initiatives  we also increased the efficiency of our research and development programs by more closely aligning our product development efforts with those of our customers and by implementing improved engineering design methodologies and practices

the plan reduced operations  research and development and administrative headcount in our san jose  taiwan and china offices  and was completed during the second quarter of in november  we initiated a restructuring plan that included consolidation of our operations in order to reduce compensation and rent expense  while at the same time making critical infrastructure investments in people  processes and information systems to improve our operating efficiency 
during  we incurred additional expenses for termination benefits and consolidation of leased space related to specific actions initiated in prior years and also incurred expenses related to the closure of our toronto office

additionally  during substantially all of the operations and research and development activities of our tualatin location were transferred to our offices in san jose  shanghai and hsin chu 
the consolidation and closure of these offices and reduction in headcount resulted in charges for non cancelable leases and termination and retention benefits for effected employees

interest income is earned on cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities 
the sequential decreases during the and periods are due to lower balances of marketable securities  which resulted from our repurchases of long term debt and decreased yields on our invested funds 
interest expense primarily relates to interest payable on our long term debt

at december   cash equivalents and short term marketable securities included million in money market funds and certificates of deposit  million in us government agencies debt securities  million in commercial paper  and  in corporate debt securities 
at december   we also held a 
table of contents million long term strategic equity investment in a publicly traded corporation 
all of our investments were denominated in us dollars  and our portfolio did not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral 
the quality of our short term investment portfolio remains high during this difficult credit environment 
our investment policy requires that at least of our portfolio matures within days 
additionally  no maturities can extend beyond months and concentrations with individual securities are limited 
investments must be rated at least a p by standard poor s moody s  and our investment policy is reviewed at least annually by our audit committee 
the valuations of our short term marketable securities are affected by a variety of factors  including changes in interest rates and the actual or perceived financial stability of the issuer 
however  due to the high quality of our investments and their short term nature  there has not been  and we do not expect there to be  a significant fluctuation in the valuation of these investments 
accordingly  we do not expect a materially negative impact on our financial condition from fluctuations in the value of our short term investments 
as of december   we had a total unrealized loss of  on these investments 
the valuation of our long term equity investment has fluctuated significantly  and could continue to fluctuate significantly  due to a variety of factors including changes in the global economy and changes in the actual or expected performance of the issuing company 
we recorded other than temporary impairments related to this investment of million 
although the valuation of our investment has increased million since we recorded our last other than temporary impairment in december  we may record additional impairment charges in the future if we determine that any future declines in value are other than temporary 
such an impairment would negatively impact our results of operations  but would not materially impact our financial condition 
when available  we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities 
if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available  we use quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  or use observable inputs other than the quoted prices  to determine fair value 
we have no investments which are fair valued based on unobservable inputs 
we anticipate that our existing cash and investment balances will be adequate to fund our operating and investing needs for the next twelve months 
from time to time  we may evaluate acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that complement our business 
we may also repurchase additional amounts of our long term debt and common stock  as we did during the first quarter of  and as described below under capital resources 
any further transactions  if consummated  may consume a material portion of our working capital or require the issuance of equity securities that may result in dilution to existing shareholders

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  warranty obligations  bad debts  inventories  property and equipment  intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  valuation of investments  amortization of prepaid royalties  valuation of share based payments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we require customers to provide purchase orders prior to shipment and we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer based on the shipping terms 
these conditions are generally satisfied upon shipment of the underlying product 
sales returns and allowances 
our customers do not have a stated right to return product except for replacement of defective products under our warranty program discussed below 
however  we have accepted customer returns on a case by case basis as customer accommodations in the past 
as a result  we provide for these returns in our reserve for sales returns and allowances 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate the reserve for returns based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 
certain of our distributors have stock rotation provisions in their distributor agreements  which allow them to return of the products purchased in the prior six months in exchange for products of equal value 
we analyze historical stock rotations at the end of each reporting period 
to date  returns under the stock rotation provisions have been nominal 
certain distributors also have price protection provisions in their distributor agreements with us 
under the price protection provisions  we grant distributors credit if they purchased product for a specific end customer and we subsequently lower the price to the end customer such that the distributor can no longer earn its negotiated margin on in stock inventory 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate a reserve for price protection credits based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 
the reserve for price protection  if required  is included in our reserve for sales returns and allowances 
product warranties 
we warrant that our products will be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of twelve months from delivery 
warranty repairs are guaranteed for the remainder of the original warranty period 
our warranty is limited to repairing or replacing products  or refunding the purchase price 

table of contents at the end of each reporting period  we estimate a reserve for warranty returns based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  which include actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  should actual product failure rates or product replacement costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we offer credit to customers after careful examination of their creditworthiness 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
at the end of each reporting period  we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our account by account risk analysis of outstanding receivable balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation 
we record a reserve against our inventory for estimated obsolete  unmarketable  and otherwise impaired products by calculating the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we review our inventory at the end of each reporting period for valuation issues 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected at the time the reserve was recorded  additional inventory write downs may be required 
useful lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets 
we evaluate the remaining useful life and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including identifiable intangible assets with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if there is an indicator of impairment  we prepare an estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of each asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
while we have concluded that the carrying value of our long lived assets is recoverable as of december   our analysis is dependent upon our estimates of future cash flows  and our actual results may vary 
valuation of investments 
we apply judgment in determining whether our marketable securities are other than temporarily impaired 
when performing our evaluation  we consider the duration of the decline  future prospects of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the security to recovery 
stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of share based payments using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires certain estimates  including an expected forfeiture rate and expected term of options granted 
we also make decisions regarding the method of calculating expected volatilities and the risk free interest rate used in the option pricing model 
the resulting calculated fair value of share based payments is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
when there are changes to the assumptions used in the option pricing model  including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  there will be variations in the calculated fair value of the share based payments  which results in variation in the compensation cost recognized 
income taxes 
we record deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we also regularly conduct a comprehensive review of our uncertain tax positions 
in this regard  an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return  or planned to be taken in a future tax return  that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
until these positions are sustained by the taxing authorities  we do not recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions and report the tax effects as a liability for uncertain tax positions in our consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is as follows payments due by period less than more than contractual obligation total year years years years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases payments on accrued balances related to asset purchases estimated q purchase commitments to contract manufacturers total the earliest date on which the holders of our convertible subordinated debentures due have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of the outstanding debentures is may  we expect holders of the debentures to require us to purchase all of the outstanding debentures on that date 
the operating lease payments above are net of sublease rental income of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions  therefore  million of income taxes payable has been excluded from the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest rate fluctuations impact the interest income that we earn on our investment portfolio and the value of our investments 
factors that could cause interest rates to fluctuate include volatility in the credit and equity markets  such as the current uncertainty in global economic conditions  changes in the monetary policies of the united states and other countries and inflation 
we mitigate risks associated with such fluctuations  as well as the risk of loss of principal  by investing in high credit quality securities and limiting concentrations of issuers and maturity dates 
derivative financial instruments are not part of our investment portfolio 
during and as of december   a significant majority of our cash and investments were held as cash or in money market funds with yields approaching zero  accordingly  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
as of december   we had convertible subordinated debentures of million outstanding with a fixed interest rate of 
interest rate changes affect the fair value of the debentures  but do not affect our earnings or cash flow 
all of our sales and inventory purchases are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our sales or cost of goods sold 
we have 
table of contents employees located in offices in japan  taiwan  korea and the people s republic of china and as such  a portion of our operating expenses as well as foreign income taxes payable are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and those currencies 
any future strengthening of those currencies against the us dollar could negatively impact our operating results by increasing our operating expenses as measured in us dollars 
we cannot reasonably estimate the effect that an immediate change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our operating results or cash flows 
currently  we do not hedge against foreign currency rate fluctuations
