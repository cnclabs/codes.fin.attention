risk factors 
our business is focused on the development and sale of ventricular assist devices vads  particularly our levacor vad levacor 
vads are mechanical assist devices that supplement the circulatory function of the heart by re routing blood flow through a mechanical pump allowing for the restoration of normal blood circulation 
in august  we received conditional approval from the us food and drug administration fda for levacor to begin a bridge to transplant btt clinical study and in january we received unconditional approval from the fda 
btt clinical study enrollment will involve approximately subjects at ten us centers initially 
the follow up period for subjects in the btt clinical trial is six months with the end points of the btt study being survival to heart transplant  six month survival on device or device removal for recovery and survival to days after device removal 
we expect to initiate a ce mark clinical trial in europe with levacor by the end of and plan to initiate a destination therapy clinical study in the us with levacor by the first half of  both contingent on our ability to obtain future financing and our ability to satisfactorily complete all regulatory requirements 
to date we have enrolled three subjects in the btt clinical study 
in addition  we  in conjunction with a consortium consisting of the university of pittsburgh  children s hospital of pittsburgh  carnegie mellon university and launchpoint technologies  inc launchpoint have been developing a small  magnetically levitated  axial rotary pediatric vad pediaflow 
the pediaflow is intended for use in newborns and infants and has been primarily funded by the national institutes of health nih 
the technology embodied in the pediaflow is also intended to form the basis for a small  minimally invasive vad mivad 
the mivad is aimed at providing partial circulatory support in an earlier stage heart failure patient 
we expect to be in a clinical trial with the mivad by the first half of on january   we announced that we completed a private placement of our common stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
gross proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
we issued an aggregate of  newly issued shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to  additional shares of common stock 

table of contents on january   we announced that effective january   world heart corporation changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from the federal jurisdiction of canada to the state of delaware in the united states through a plan of arrangement 
on july   we completed a million private placement transaction and recapitalization recapitalization agreement 
under the terms of the recapitalization  we issued million common shares issuance 
in connection with the issuance  the parties to the recapitalization entered into a registration rights agreement dated july   as amended october   to register the common shares issued in connection with the issuance and abiomed conversion 
we paid aggregate cash commission of  and issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of  common shares to our advisors 
on august   we announced that we were embarking on a phased consolidation into a primary facility at our current location in salt lake city  utah 
as part of our consolidation plan  on february   we announced that we had appointed mr 
john alexander martin as our president and chief executive officer and on august  we announced that we had appointed mr 
morgan r 
brown as our executive vice president and chief financial officer  with both positions based in salt lake city  utah 
mr 
jal s 
jassawalla  our former president and ceo  currently our executive vice president and chief technology officer  continues to be based in oakland  california  along with certain key employees in areas such as research and development  clinical affairs and regulatory affairs 
research and development by our competitors is proceeding on several rotary flow devices 
certain of these devices have received the ce mark in europe and are advancing through clinical trials in the united states and europe  and one device has received us marketing approval for the btt and destination therapy indications 
we believe that our levacor has significant clinical  blood handling  durability  and ease of use benefits as compared to our competitors

historically  sales of novacor lvas implant kits and related peripheral equipment and services accounted for the majority of our revenue 
in addition  we generated revenue from sales of spus segmented poly urethane solution  used by one other medical device manufacturer 
we do not expect any sale of novacor lvas or any significant sales of spus to occur in the future

we continue to support our novacor patients but have discontinued the manufacture and sale of the novacor lvas 
we do not anticipate any novacor product revenues in we recognized zero and  in spus revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is a result of this revenue being associated with one customer with no purchase orders being placed in  as well as consolidation of our operations to salt lake city  utah

liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded losses from operations through the sale of equity and issuance of debt instruments 
combined with revenues and investment income  these funds have provided us with the resources to operate our business  sell and support our products  attract and retain key personnel  fund 
table of contents our research and development programs and clinical trials and apply and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  a decrease of million from december  for the year ended december   cash used to fund operating activities was million  consisting primarily of the net loss for the period of million  offset by non cash charges of  for depreciation and amortization  million for non cash stock compensation expense and  in non cash charges related to the launchpoint note 
working capital changes consisted of a  decrease in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses

financing activities in consisted of million proceeds from our private placement transaction and recapitalization  million in a bridge loan  offset by million in expense related to the private placement and convertible debentures 
we expect that our existing capital resources  including the million raised in our january private placement  will be sufficient to allow us to maintain our current and planned operations through at least however  our actual needs will depend on numerous factors  including the progress and scope of our internally funded research and development activities  our success in manufacturing levacor on a timely basis sufficient to meet the needs of our clinical trials  and the costs we incur in obtaining and enforcing patent and other proprietary rights or gaining the freedom to operate under the patents and others 
our levacor clinical trial may be modified or terminated for many reasons including the risk that our device demonstrates safety issues  the risk that regulatory authorities may not approve our device for further development or may require additional or expanded clinical trials to be performed  and the risk that we or our suppliers may not be able to supply sufficient quantities of our device  parts  or materials to support clinical trial  which could lead to a disruption or cessation of the clinical trials 
if any of the events occur  our actual capital needs may substantially exceed our anticipated capital needs and we may have to substantially modify or terminate current and planned clinical trials or postpone conducting future clinical trials 
as a result  our business may be materially harmed  our stock price may be adversely affected  and our ability to raise additional capital may be impaired 
we will need to raise substantial additional funds to support our long term research  product development and commercialization programs 
we regularly consider various fund raising alternatives  including  for example  debt or equity financing and merger and acquisition alternatives 
we may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances  collaborations  or license agreements and other financing mechanisms 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs  or to obtain funds 
table of contents through arrangements with licensees or other that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies that we by otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue and research and development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  accrual of research and development expenses  inventory capitalization  and  share based compensation  revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with asc  revenue recognition 
pursuant to purchase agreements or orders  we ship product to our customers 
revenue from product sales is only recognized when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to our customers  the selling price is fixed and collection is reasonably assured 
beginning in  we expect a majority of our product sales will be made on a consignment basis and as such  pursuant to the terms of the consignment arrangements  revenue is generally recognized on the date the consigned product is implanted or otherwise consumed 
revenue from product sales not sold on a consignment basis is generally recognized upon customer receipt and acceptance of the product 
beginning in  revenue will be recognized from sales of the levacor in connection with our btt clinical trial 
the significant elements of our multiple element offerings are implant kits  peripherals and other 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we recognize revenue using the residual method as described in asc  revenue recognition software or asc  revenue recognition of multiple element arrangements 
under the residual method  revenue is allocated and deferred for the undelivered elements based on relative fair value 
the determination of fair value of the undelivered elements in multiple elements arrangements is based on the price charged when such elements are sold separately  which is commonly referred to as vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe 
each element s revenue is recognized when all of the revenue recognition criteria are met for each of the elements 
trade receivables are recorded for product sales and do not bear interest 
we regularly evaluate the collectability of trade receivables 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated credit losses 
when estimating credit losses  we consider a number of factors including the aging of a customer s account  credit worthiness of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
at december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively 
accrual of research and development expenses 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to conduct clinical trials  
table of contents develop and manufacture devices  and associated overhead and facilities costs 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
invoicing from third party contractors for services performed can lag several months 
we accrue the costs of services rendered in connection with third party contractor activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and monitoring costs and date management costs 
differences between actual clinical trial costs and estimated clinical trial costs have not be material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
inventory capitalization 
we expense costs relating to the production of inventories as research and development r d expense in the period incurred until such time as we believe future commercialization is considered probable and future economic benefit is expected to be recognized  which generally is reliant upon receipt of regulatory approval 
we then begin to capitalize subsequent inventory costs relating to the product 
we received a conditional investigational device exemption in august from the fda for the levacor and subsequently began selling our product through our btt clinical trial 
therefore  effective august   we adopted a policy for capitalizing inventory and recognizing cost of sales related to the levacor 
prior to august   all costs associated with the manufacturing the levacor and related surgical and peripheral products were expensed as r d costs 
therefore  gross margin on sales of our product will be higher until our zero cost inventory is fully consumed 
inventories are stated at the lower cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out  fifo method 
we utilize a standard costing system  which requires significant management judgment and estimates in determining and applying standard labor and overhead rates 
labor and overhead rates are estimated based on our best estimate of annual production volumes and labor rates and hours per manufacturing process 
these estimates are based on historical experience and budgeted expenses and production volume 
estimates are set at the beginning of the year and updated periodically 
while we believe our standard costs are reliable  actual production costs and volume change may impact inventory  costs of sales and the absorption of production overhead expenses 
we review our inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
we included in inventory materials and finished goods that can be held for sale or used in non revenue clinical trials 
products consumed in non revenue clinical trials are expensed as part of research and development when consumed 
share based compensation 
we recognize share based compensation expense in connection with our share based awards  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  and therefore only recognize compensation costs for those awards expected to vest over the service period of the award 
we use a black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options 
calculating share based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective judgment and assumptions  including estimates of expected life of the award  stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and risk free interest rates 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of shared based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
when appropriate  we estimate the expected life of a stock option by averaging the contractual term of the stock option grants up to years with the associated vesting term typically or years 
we estimate the volatility of our publicly traded shares 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on our historical experience of forfeitures and our employee retention rate 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
we estimate the risk free interest rate 
table of contents based on rates in effect for united states government bonds with terms similar to the expected lives of the awards at the time of grant 
estimates of share based compensation expenses are significant to our financial statements  but these expenses are based on option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by us 
contractual obligations the following represents our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands total less than year years years thereafter operating leases purchase obligations note payable gross interest on note payable capital lease obligations minimum royalty payment obligations total purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for services  manufacturing agreements and other research and purchase commitments
