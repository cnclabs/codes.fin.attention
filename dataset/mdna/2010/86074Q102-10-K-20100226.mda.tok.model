item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and notes  included elsewhere in this report  and the information contained in part ii  item selected financial and operating data 
overview principal factors affecting stillwater mining company stillwater mining company is a delaware corporation  listed on the new york stock exchange and headquartered in columbus  montana 
the company mines  processes  refines and markets platinum and palladium ores from two underground mines situated within the j m reef  an extensive trend of pgm mineralization located in stillwater and sweet grass counties in south central montana 
the mined ore is crushed and concentrated in a mill located at each of the mine sites and then trucked to columbus  montana  where the concentrates are further processed in a smelter and base metals refinery into a pgm rich filter cake 
the filter cake then is shipped to third parties for final refining into finished metal 
pgm ore grades in the j m reef are some of the best in the world  but are palladium rich and  because of the uplifted configuration of the reef  costly and complex to mine 
the mines compete primarily with pgm ore reserves within south africa s bushveld complex  which generally enjoy a much higher proportion of platinum content and are less steeply dipping  and with nickel mines in the russian federation which produce pgms as a major by product and so at a very low marginal cost 
consequently  in periods of low pgm prices  stillwater mining company s palladium rich production ratio and cost structure may put it at a disadvantage to these competitors 
see business  risk factors and properties risk factors the company may be competitively disadvantaged as a primary pgm producer with a preponderance of palladium for further discussion 
in response to the steep deterioration in pgm prices during the second half of  the company reacted by restructuring its operations  targeting its business plan for toward preserving cash and maintaining the company s viability in the face of a severe economic downturn of uncertain duration 
further complicating this effort was the recognition that the company s largest sales agreement  which includes a floor price structure that tends to protect the company during periods of low pgm prices  is slated to expire at the end of  and that demand for automobiles  the principal industry served by pgm suppliers  had largely collapsed along with the general economy 
the restructuring of the company s operations in late resulted in transfers and employee layoffs  elimination of many contractors  revisions to the company s mining processes  closure of the corporate offices in billings  and severe restrictions on operating and capital expenditures 
in total  the company reduced its workforce to  by march   from  at september  during the same period  mostly by transferring between mines  the miner workforce at the east boulder mine was reduced to from  while the stillwater mine increased its number of miners to from in addition  another contract miners not included in these totals were released from service  mostly at the stillwater mine 
following cutbacks at the corporate office  the remaining employees there were transferred from billings to various other existing offices in columbus and at the mines 
several corporate programs  including market development  recruiting  exploration and investor relations  were eliminated or sharply curtailed 
capital spending  which had totaled about million in  was reduced to million in at year end  the company s workforce including contractors totaled  following continuing adjustments to the late restructuring  for a total workforce reduction including contractors from september  just short of 
although the restructuring efforts were corporate wide  the most radical restructuring took place at the company s east boulder mine 
east boulder s ore grades are consistently lower than those at the stillwater mine  and as a result its cash costs per ounce tend to be significantly higher 
in the low price environment of late  it was clear that without substantial changes to east boulder s operations  the mine would be consuming cash at an unacceptable rate 
following a brief shutdown while management evaluated its options  the company proposed a restructuring alternative that  while drastically reducing the mine s workforce  held out hope for the mine s continuing viability 
the restructuring plan involved cutting back on the number of mining areas at east boulder and assigning small  essentially self sufficient teams to each of those areas 
the teams would be responsible for most of their own support  bringing their own supplies to the 
table of contents workface and installing most utilities themselves 
the total mine workforce at east boulder was to be reduced by more than  from down to employees 
capital spending at the mine was cut from the million spent in to just million budgeted for  which included only enough capital spending to keep the immediate mining areas functioning 
the company projected that with these and other cost cutting changes  the mine could operate at a cash breakeven level given the pgm prices prevailing at the end of by  almost any measure  the benefits of the company s corporate restructuring exceeded expectations 
the company had initially projected total mine production from the two mines would be about  ounces  the mines together produced  ounces in the stillwater mine was budgeted to produce about  ounces and produced almost  ounces for the year 
total cash costs at stillwater were projected at per ounce and averaged per ounce  benefiting from the mine s improved productivity 
similarly  east boulder production for was budgeted at about  ounces at a cash cost of per ounce  the mine produced  ounces in at an average cash cost of per ounce 
comparing east boulder s production in to the prior year  output was  ounces  so despite reducing the workforce there by  production at east boulder only declined by 
because of the higher productivities at east boulder  the mine also was able to accomplish substantially more development work than planned during  for the most part without bringing in any additional resources 
while management believes that these higher productivities should be sustainable in the future  mine production would almost certainly decline over time without an increased level of spending for capital development in and thereafter 
consequently  higher development spending is included in the company s business plan 
in looking more closely at the improvement in cash cost per ounce at both mines  it appears that about half of the cost reduction was attributable to lower prices for materials and energy consumed in the operations  including steel  explosives  fuel and electricity  and to the elimination of contract miners 
some portion of this savings might reasonably be expected to reverse as the economy recovers and commodity prices rise 
the remaining savings  however  was the result of improved productivity producing more ounces per labor hour worked 
because the miners are incentivized to increase productivity  their individual compensation increases as a result of these improvements suggesting that a portion of these productivity gains may be sustainable going forward 
a large share of the company s mine production is sold under a sales agreement with ford motor company that will expire at the end of under this sales agreement  the company has committed of its mined palladium production and of its mined platinum production during to ford 
this agreement includes floor prices on palladium and platinum that have provided a measure of financial protection to the company during periods of low pgm prices 
unless this agreement is renewed or replaced on similarly favorable terms  after  the company will be fully exposed to the volatility of pgm market prices 
should the pgm markets experience a substantial and sustained pricing downturn  in the absence of these floor prices the company could be forced to curtail all or a portion of its operations  the company s future financial performance could be impaired and its ongoing viability called into question 
during  the company s other long term pgm supply agreement  with general motors corporation  was rejected as part of the general motors bankruptcy proceedings 
the company did not have any outstanding receivables from general motors at the time of the bankruptcy filing  but rejection of the agreement did eliminate its pricing floor on palladium and therefore a portion of the company s downside price protection 
loss of the gm agreement did not have any adverse financial consequences on the company during  as the palladium price moved above the gm floor price following the bankruptcy action 
to protect itself against the loss of the downside price protection in these long term supply agreements  the company has taken a number of actions 
principal among these is a continuing effort to drive down the cash cost of mining operations  thereby allowing the company to maintain a positive cash margin down to as low a pricing level as it can 
over the past several years  the company has invested heavily in the developed state of the two mines  getting ahead on mine development so that if it became necessary to scale back capital expenditures for mine development during a period of low pgm prices  the company could do so without significantly impairing future performance 
the company also has deliberately targeted to maintain a relatively strong corporate liquidity position  providing a financial reserve in the event of a pricing downturn 
and the company s recycling operations  although sensitive to price  provide an added source of financial support in addition to the mines 
with all this  however  there is no certainty that the company would be able to survive an extended major decline in pgm prices in the absence of the contractual pricing floors 
the company recycles spent catalyst materials through its processing facilities in columbus  montana  recovering palladium  platinum and rhodium from these materials 
the recycling segment has proven to be a profitable ancillary business that utilizes available capacity in the company s smelting and refining facilities at minimal incremental cost to 
table of contents the company 
however  the recycling business has also proven to be very sensitive to pgm prices  and volumes of recycling material available in the market have dropped very sharply when pgm prices have declined as has profitability 
during the price collapse in late  some entities in the recycling supply chain were caught with inventory on hand as prices declined  apparently incurring substantial losses 
the company had made working capital advances to some of these suppliers in this period to assist them in procuring recycling materials 
at the end of  the company concluded that a substantial portion of these advances were no longer collectible  and consequently the company took a non cash charge in of million against its advances on inventory purchases for recycling  reducing its profit in the recycling segment to million 
reflecting lower recycling volumes and pgm prices in  recycling segment earnings in totaled million 
during  the company modified its recycling business model  increasing the percentage of material that is toll processed for a fee on behalf of others  placing tighter restrictions on cash advances to suppliers and broadening its base of direct suppliers 
the volume of recycled material available to the company has gradually increased during as pgm prices have strengthened 
with this gradual volume growth  the company has also seen inventory working capital requirements begin to increase again 
at the end of  recycling working capital in inventories and advances totaled million  up from million at the end of but substantially below the million reported at june   before pgm prices collapsed 
supplier advances outstanding at december   excluding those written down at the end of totaled million 
a portion of these advances is secured by material in supplier inventory  but the remainder is not secured and remains at risk 
see business  risk factors and properties risk factors reliance on third parties for sourcing of recycling materials and the concentration of recycling sources creates the potential for losses for further discussion 
the company s recycling activities are substantially dependent on the availability in the smelter of the copper and nickel contained in the mine concentrates 
copper and nickel bind with the pgms from recycling in the smelter and so aid in collecting the pgms 
should it become necessary at some point to reduce or suspend operations at the mines  the proportion of operating costs allocated to the recycling segment could increase  making the recycling segment less competitive 
further  in order to operate the smelter and refinery without significant volumes of mine concentrates  modifications to the processing facilities would probably be required 
there is no assurance that the recycling facilities can operate profitably in the absence of significant concentrates from the mines  or that capital would be available under those circumstances to complete any necessary modifications to the processing facilities 
on march   the company issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible debentures due the terms of these debentures are described in more detail in the section below entitled convertible debentures 
on october   in a private transaction the company redeemed million in principal value of these outstanding convertible debentures in exchange for million common shares of the company 
management viewed this transaction as slightly improving the company s long term liquidity position on economically advantageous terms  however  accounting principles required that the fair value of any shares issued in such an exchange in excess of the shares per debenture conversion ratio specified in the indenture be treated as expense 
consequently  the company recognized a non cash inducement loss of million on the exchange transaction 
results and commentary the company reported a net loss of million for the year  compared to a loss of million for the year for the fourth quarter of  the company incurred a loss of million  compared to a net loss of million in the last quarter of the full year results include charges of million for lower of cost or market inventory adjustments  a non cash inducement loss of million on the exchange of million of the company s common shares for million face amount of the company s convertible debentures  and million to write down uncollectible advances and receivables 
the results reflect the challenges of very low pgm prices early in  with associated inventory adjustments and other write downs  followed by a gradual strengthening of pgm prices and improved performance as the year progressed 
as already noted  the fourth quarter of included an million non cash charge for shares issued in exchange for debt 
from a liquidity perspective  cash and cash equivalents increased by million during  and short term investments increased by million 
during the fourth quarter of  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  while short term investments increased by million 
a detailed comparison of these outcomes is presented below in results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  during  the company s mining operations produced a total of  ounces of palladium and platinum  including  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum  exceeding both initial guidance for the year of 
table of contents  ounces and the most recent guidance of  ounces 
this increase in mine production primarily reflected higher than projected mining productivities at both operations 
in  the company processed  ounces of recycled pgms in its smelting and refining facilities  a decrease from the  total ounces processed in the lower volumes processed during reflect the decline in recycling volumes available generally following the drop in pgm prices during the second half of during  the company restructured its arrangements with its largest recycling supplier and broadened the base of suppliers it deals with directly 
the company has also increased the percentage of tolling material it processes and has restricted working capital advances significantly 
capital spending was cut back severely in  as the company s objective to remain at least cash neutral during the economic downturn sharply limited the scope of mine development and equipment purchases for the year 
actual capital expenditures of million were about on target with the company s public guidance for the year of about million 
most of the capital was allocated to mine development initiatives necessary to support current production 
while spending at both mines for was budgeted short of the pace required to replace the proven reserves mined during the year  with overall productivities significantly better  primary development footage  while within the spending budget  was ahead of plan at  feet 
this improvement in development productivity is significant  in that even with the sharp cutback in development spending the stillwater mine was able to achieve adequate new development footage in to sustain its current level of production and the east boulder mine  once the benefit of its restructuring was in place  achieved sustainable development rates in the fourth quarter of the budget also included about million to complete construction started in and commission the second electric furnace at the smelter in columbus 
performance graph following on a very volatile  market prices for platinum and palladium gradually recovered from their initial lows as progressed 
as the chart above shows  announcements of power shortages in south africa early in  on top of already robust commodity markets  created something of a pricing bubble for pgms during the first half of this reversed fairly abruptly in the second half of as credit markets deteriorated and economic recession loomed 
combined with severe financial pressures on and pgm inventory liquidations by the automotive industry  the primary customer for pgms  the economic situation brought pgm prices down steeply 
the year saw some pricing stability gradually return  as investor interest in commodities as a store of economic value and an inflation hedge served to spark some demand that took up slack from the ailing automotive industry 
as of december   palladium and platinum were quoted in london at and  per ounce  respectively  corresponding prices at december   were per ounce for palladium and per ounce for platinum 
typically  the company s mines produce about times as much palladium as platinum  a relationship driven by the relative percentages of the two metals in the ore and by metal recoveries achieved during processing 
see note to the ore reserves table on page for a discussion of the in situ ratio of palladium to platinum in the ore 
floor and ceiling prices in the company s sales agreements also affect the company s realizations 
the company s average realization per 
table of contents sold ounce on combined platinum and palladium sales from mining for was per ounce  comprised of per ounce for palladium and  per ounce for platinum  for the fourth quarter of  the corresponding average realization was per ounce 
this compares to an average realization of per platinum and palladium ounce sold for the full year  and per ounce for the fourth quarter of putting these realizations into perspective  mining cost of sales for the full year including depreciation and amortization but excluding corporate overhead and adjusting for the benefit of by product revenues averaged the equivalent of per ounce  indicating a margin on mining operations of about per ounce 
for the fourth quarter of  with somewhat stronger market prices  mining costs of sales net of by product proceeds averaged per ounce  for a mining margin of about per ounce 
for the full year  despite higher average realizations  the corresponding mining margin on average was negative by about per ounce excluding the impairment charge at east boulder  and for the fourth quarter of the company s mining margin was extremely negative at about per ounce 
while the improvement in margins in is partially due to higher pgm prices  it also reflects significantly lower average mining expenses 
the company s reported loss for of million was derived primarily from two sources 
the first  which has already been discussed  is the million non cash inducement loss recorded during the fourth quarter in conjunction with the exchange of shares for debentures 
the other factor relates mostly to the first quarter  when for a time while prices were low and the company was still in the process of restructuring the mines  mining costs exceeded the realizable value of production  resulting in lower of cost or market adjustments to the amounts carried in inventory 
such adjustments during the first quarter totaled about million 
thereafter  as mining productivities improved and pgm prices increased  such adjustments diminished both in frequency and in size 
late in the third quarter of  management recognized the urgent need to make substantial changes to the company s operations in the face of looming heavy losses 
in particular  there was a need to resolve the cost picture at the east boulder mine 
as a result  after considerable debate  the east boulder operating plan was radically restructured  introducing a leaner  team based mining approach  with each team intended to be more or less self sufficient and focused on its specific mining area 
a total of miners were transferred from east boulder to stillwater  allowing the stillwater mine to fully staff its mining operations and replace higher cost mining contractors with company employees 
the restructuring also required terminating over employees at the east boulder mine 
these changes were implemented in december various other broad based changes were implemented at about the same time to conserve corporate cash 
capital expenditures and any discretionary expenditures were cut back sharply at all locations  with development limited to only what was necessary to maintain current operations 
staffing at all locations was revisited in an effort to bring support costs into line with recent lower production levels 
contractors were replaced by company employees wherever feasible 
the corporate office in billings was closed  with the remaining corporate staff reassigned to offices in columbus or at the mines 
the project to install a second electric furnace at the smelter was reviewed  but was deemed far enough along and of sufficient strategic importance that it should be completed with elements of the project restructured to save costs 
purchasing arrangements with suppliers were also addressed to ensure competitive pricing terms 
the company s stated objective for was to remain at least cash neutral from an operating perspective  without taking any benefit from cash generated by reductions in working capital associated with the recycling business 
the company more than achieved this goal  growing balance sheet cash and investments during by million and in addition generating another million that was reinvested into recycling working capital 
however  because pgm prices rose during the year  the question arises as to how much of the benefit is attributable to higher prices 
based on the year end pgm prices noted above as compared to average prices actually realized in  it appears that the benefit to the company s liquidity of the higher than planned pgm prices during was about million 
that suggests that the company would have been within about million of its objective of cash neutrality  even without the benefit of the higher prices 
as part of its cash conservation effort during  the company scaled back capital expenditures for mine development  reducing them temporarily to a level below that required to keep proven reserves level in the face of ongoing mine production 
consequently  the company s ore reserves declined  although modestly  during as in past years  the company has engaged behre dolbear as third party independent geological experts to review and express an expert opinion on the company s ore reserve calculations 
the company performs its ore reserve economic assessment using a twelve quarter trailing price in order to level out short term volatility in metals prices 
the company regards the twelve quarter trailing average as a reasonable surrogate for long term future pgm prices over the period 
table of contents when the reserves will be mined 
the combined twelve quarter trailing weighted average price for platinum and palladium at december   was about per ounce 
at this price  the company s geologic ore reserves at each mine can be shown to generate undiscounted positive cash flow over the life of the reserve 
consequently  the company s ore reserves were not constrained economically at december  it is important to note that the company s ore reserve estimates are dependent upon pgm prices  and should pgm prices decline for an extended period the trailing twelve quarter price will also decline 
at a sufficiently low price level  the company s ore reserves might no longer generate positive cash flows 
following the company s methodology  should prices fall there can be no assurance that the company s reported proven and probable ore reserves will not be constrained economically in the future 
the company s efforts to restructure its mining operations are intended to improve mining productivity and reduce average costs to a level that minimizes  to the extent possible  the company s future exposure to potential periods of lower pgm prices 
the company also has reviewed the carrying value of its assets for impairment at december  the company determined that there have been no material events or changes in circumstances during the fourth quarter of  or subsequently  that indicate the likelihood of any impairment of long lived assets 
in view of the economic situation at the end of  the company with assistance from behre dolbear assessed the fair value of the east boulder mine assets as of december   and concluded that a valuation adjustment was needed at that time 
consequently  the company s reported earnings at december   included a million impairment charge that reduced the carrying value of the east boulder mine assets to million 
in december of  standard and poor s upgraded the company s debt rating from b to b  citing improved market conditions and adequate liquidity 
both moody s investors service and standard and poor s had downgraded the company s corporate credit rating by two notches during as economic conditions deteriorated 
at issue has been the company s strong dependence on its automotive agreements  lack of geographic or product diversity  metal market price volatility  and difficult cost structure 
in view of the current restrictive credit markets and the company s strong liquidity position  management has elected to defer seeking to put a revolving credit facility in place until market conditions improve 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be successful in securing an adequate revolving credit facility when it does seek to do so 
the pending expiration of the company s supply agreement with ford motor company at the end of creates exposure to any extended decline in pgm market prices 
the floor price for palladium in the ford agreement has been a significant financial support for the company during periods of low pgm prices in the past 
although the company may negotiate a replacement supply agreement with ford or other industry participants  it is not likely that analogous floor price provisions would be included in such an agreement 
consequently  the company has focused its strategic efforts on positioning itself for life after the ford agreement 
to this end  the company has been working to improve the efficiency and productivity of its mining operations so that its competitiveness at low pgm prices is correspondingly improved 
likewise  the company has supported efforts to develop new applications for pgms and to open new markets for them  seeking to strengthen demand and so sustain higher metals prices in the longer term 
continued efforts to diversify the company  both internally and externally  are intended to decrease the company s dependence on the price of just one or two operations and one or two commodities for financial viability 
management continues to focus on all of these objectives in preparing for a post auto agreement environment and may increase the level of resources applied to these efforts during statistically  the company s safety performance a key management focus during was mixed  with excellent results at the east boulder mine but an increase in the reportable incident rate at the stillwater mine 
overall  the company s rate of medical reportable incidents in was incidents per  hours worked  up from the rate of in management is working closely with the company s workforce in an effort to address this increase 
areas of specific focus from a safety perspective include instilling and encouraging a cultural emphasis on safety  enhancing pre shift work place examinations  reviewing safety standards implementation and compliance  standardizing accident incident investigations and near miss reporting and designating loss control representatives who are part of the mining workforce 
employee led focus teams have been successful in addressing many safety related challenges 
the company s environmental performance continued its excellent track record during environmental compliance is a very high priority in view of the pristine area in which the company operates 
the company has a record of open communication and cooperative  proactive involvement with local and regional environmental groups 
the company s ground breaking good neighbor agreement with these groups provides a vehicle for facilitating such communication and addressing issues cooperatively 

table of contents in light of the recent environmental protection agency s determination to regulate carbon dioxide emissions as hazardous to health  the company has assessed its exposure to likely restrictions on such emissions 
the company s principal sources of co emissions are limited to a comparatively few internal combustion engines in vehicles and mining equipment  and to stationary sources such as process heaters  dryers and converters that consume natural gas 
the company already utilizes buses to transport its workforce to and from the mines and utilizes biodiesel fuels in its operations in order to reduce its carbon footprint 
consequently  any taxes or added restrictions on emissions are unlikely to have any direct material effect on the company s operations 
the company s physical exposure to climate change is minimal 
the company s operations are not materially dependent upon weather patterns or seasonal availability of water 
the relatively remote location of the mines presents some exposure to severe weather  particularly winter snowfall that can restrict access to the mine sites  but the company already regularly addresses this issue during the winter months in montana 
similarly  summer wildfires can temporarily restrict access to the mines  but their duration tends to be relatively short 
probably the company s most significant exposure to greenhouse gas regulation is the potential consequence of a substantial longer term movement away from internal combustion engines on the demand for pgms in catalytic converters 
such a major shift in automotive demand could depress pgm prices and impair the company s financial performance 
regulatory constraints on other industries also could affect the price or availability of electricity and other materials  driving up the company s operating costs 
the company s mining permits require that  in conjunction with its mining and processing activities  it must provide adequate financial surety in support of its permit obligations to complete final reclamation and remediation once mining operations cease 
as of december   the company had outstanding approximately million of surety bonds and letters of credit in favor of state and federal agencies to guarantee its final reclamation commitments 
regulatory authorities are currently in the midst of updating an eis  which when finalized will determine whether or not the existing surety amounts are sufficient 
in the interim  however  as the economy weakened late in  the company agreed to increase its surety bonding by an additional million as an interim measure to alleviate concerns aired by the agencies involved and to allow time for the eis to be completed 
upon completion of the eis  it is likely that additional surety increases will be required 
the shortages of skilled manpower and the high employee attrition rates that challenged the company during the strong commodities markets of through have abated with the economic downturn in late and throughout as already noted  the restructuring at the east boulder mine provided an opportunity to transfer skilled miners over to the stillwater mine  largely alleviating the shortages there and allowing the company to replace higher cost contractors with its own employees 
the lower attrition rates have brought some stability to the company s mining operations and undoubtedly contributed to the improved productivities seen during however  this shift in the labor market has been driven mostly by lower metal prices and the weak economy  and there is no assurance that the same challenges will not reappear as commodity prices recover 
outlook looking forward  management projects that the company s mine production for will be about  ounces of palladium and platinum  generally in the same range as the company s guidance given for during  the company will continue to focus on optimizing mining costs at both operations rather than on maximizing production 
however  as in  there may be opportunity for some upside on production as additional mining efficiencies are achieved 
total cash costs per ounce a non gaap measure of extraction efficiency for are projected at  again in the same range as was achieved during as already noted  the level of capital expenditures was less than required to sustain the current level of mining operations over the longer term 
however  the improved mining efficiencies should help to provide sustainability going forward 
the heavy capital investment in through to expand the developed state of the mines had positioned the company well to endure the cut in capital spending in during economic downturn 
total capital expenditures are expected to increase to about million in  which when coupled with the higher development productivity should be adequate to sustain long term operations at the current production level 
these targets assume that pgm market prices on balance will continue to strengthen over the longer term 
strong investment interest in pgms lifted pricing somewhat during and may cause it to continue to strengthen in  but in the end there can be no sustainable recovery in pgm pricing until the economy rebuilds enough momentum to free up consumer credit so the automotive markets recover 
automotive and related demand for platinum and palladium in normal years comprises around of the market demand for these metals  so recovery of automotive demand is critical to the supply demand balance for pgms 

table of contents on the supply side of the industry  the recent economic downturn led to several higher cost pgm mines being placed on care and maintenance  with operations suspended at least until prices recover sufficiently to justify reopening them 
one of these properties  the lac des iles mine in canada owned by north american palladium  has announced recently that it will reopen sometime in the first half of however  several other properties in south africa remain shuttered  constrained not only by weak platinum demand but also by a comparatively strong local currency that has offset some of the recovery seen during in dollar denominated metal prices 
reportedly  reinvestment levels at existing mines and funding for new pgm exploration have also been severely curtailed in the present environment 
palladium production at norilsk nickel in the past two or three years also has fallen short of previous peak output levels  presumably reflecting a lower average pgm grade in the mix of ores they are mining 
once the automotive industry begins showing signs of recovery  the already improved pgm pricing should benefit from the increased demand 
automobile industry sources have indicated that substantial research effort over the past several years has gone into opportunities to substitute palladium in applications that currently use platinum and rhodium 
this substitution is expected to benefit palladium  the company s principal product 
taken together with increasingly stringent emission control regulations worldwide and continuing growth in vehicle demand in the developing world  along with growing emphasis on recycling  management is reasonably optimistic regarding the longer term future of these businesses 
this future is not without risks  however  and should the present economic downturn worsen substantially or extend for several years  the company s viability could be severely challenged particularly after the ford agreement expires 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues the company s total revenues  including proceeds from the sale of by products  totaled million in  a decrease of compared to revenues of million in this substantial year on year decline in total revenues reflects much lower recycling sales volumes in as compared to  as well as lower pgm realizations in revenues from mine production totaled million in including million from by products  compared to million in of which million was from by products

overall  recycling cost of metals sold declined to million in from million in the average acquisition cost of metal purchased in the company s recycling segment including platinum  palladium and rhodium decreased to per ounce in from  per ounce in  reflecting lower pgm prices in in response to weakened demand from the automotive sector 
during  the company s mining operations produced  ounces of pgms  including  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum 
this represented a increase from  when the company s mining operations produced  ounces of pgms  including  of palladium and  ounces of platinum 
the 
table of contents stillwater mine produced  ounces of pgms in  compared with  ounces of pgms in  a increase 
the east boulder mine produced  ounces of pgms in  down compared with the  ounces of pgms produced there in  but the production was accomplished with less than of the workforce 
the cost of metals sold from mine production  despite higher production  decreased to million in  compared to million in the prior year  a improvement 
the company s mining costs decreased during mainly as a result of a lower level of employment  lower prices for key consumables such as fuel  power  steel and explosives  improved efficiencies in mining processes  much reduced reliance on contractors and redirection of mining out of some higher cost areas 
the cost of metals sold for metal purchased in the open market for resale was million in  compared to million in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million in  compared to million in to a large extent  the lower expense in was the result of a million impairment adjustment to the carrying value of the east boulder mine taken at the end of  resulting in lower amortization rates in marketing the company reduced its market development efforts for palladium to some extent during the company spent million in support of marketing programs during  down from million in general and administrative excluding marketing expenses discussed above  general and administrative costs were million in  compared to million in  a decrease  as increased share based compensation expense partially offset other corporate cost reductions

the results discussed in the following comparison reflect the reporting change 
the company s total revenues  including proceeds from the sale of by products  totaled million in  compared to million in  a increase 
this increase was net of hedging losses on forward sales of platinum of million on  ounces hedged in  and million on  ounces hedged in the 
table of contents increase in total revenues reflects substantially higher average realized prices  particularly in the first six months of  which more than offset lower mine production sales volumes in revenues from mine production were million in including million from by products  compared to million in of which million was from by products  an increase 
the increase was attributable to the higher realized market prices in early which more than made up for the lower volume of mined ounces sold in platinum and palladium ounces sold from mine production were  in  compared to  ounces in the average realization on these platinum and palladium sales including the effects of hedging and of floor and ceiling prices in the underlying agreements was per ounce in and per ounce in reduced by product revenues were generally due to lower sales in  particularly for rhodium and nickel 
revenues from pgm recycling grew during  increasing to million in  from million in recycled ounces sold increased in to  ounces compared to  ounces in and the company s combined average realization on recycling sales which include palladium  platinum and rhodium increased to  per ounce in from  per ounce in the company processed increased volumes of recycled materials on a tolling basis in the company toll processed  ounces of pgms during  up from  tolled ounces in total recycling volume increased to  ounces of pgms in up from  ounces in the company recognized other revenue of million and million for metal purchased in the open market and resold in and  respectively 
costs of metals sold costs of metals sold  which excludes depreciation expense and no longer includes credits for by products  was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
even though the volume of purchased recycling material increased from year to year  significantly higher pgm prices drove up the acquisition cost of the material  which largely accounted for an increase in recycling costs of metals sold to million in from million in the average acquisition cost of metal in the company s recycling segment including platinum  palladium and rhodium increased to  per ounce in from  per ounce in  reflecting much higher average prices for pgms  particularly for platinum and rhodium 
during  the company s mining operations produced  ounces of pgms  including  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively 
this represents about a decrease from  during which the company s mining operations produced  ounces of pgms  including  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively 
the stillwater mine produced  ounces of pgms in  compared with  ounces of pgms in  a decrease 
the east boulder mine produced  ounces of pgms in  compared with  ounces of pgms in  a year on year decrease 
the lower production in reflected the restructuring at the east boulder mine and somewhat lower ore grades associated with the specific mining areas in at the stillwater mine 
the costs of metals sold from mine production  despite lower production  increased to million in  compared to million in the prior year  a increase 
the company s mining costs increased during mostly as a result of higher commodity prices for materials consumed in mining 
the costs of metals sold on palladium purchases for resale was million in  compared to million in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million in  compared to million in although amortization rates per ton mined were generally higher in than in  the lower tonnage produced in more than offset the effect of the higher tonnage rates 
exploration the company participated in several early stage exploration programs during and  spending million and million to meet commitments under these programs during and  respectively 
in addition  the company expended million in and million in toward equity investments in exploration companies 
during  the company also wrote down a portion of its equity investments in these ventures to fair value  taking charges totaling nearly million 
marketing the company continued its market development efforts for palladium during  largely in support of the palladium alliance international  spending million on marketing  up slightly from million in 
table of contents general and administrative general and administrative costs were million in  compared to million in  an increase  reflecting higher payroll and contractor costs 
in addition to these costs  the company separately incurred about million in restructuring costs during  mostly associated with employee and contract terminations and re location of the billings corporate office 
other corporate costs in  such adjustments included a million asset impairment write down at the east boulder mine  a million provision for uncollectable receivables and advances mostly associated with recycling activities  a million charge to mark investments to market  and million for restructuring costs 
interest income and expense interest income decreased to million in from million in  on the result of lower recycling balances in the last quarter of the company s balance of cash and related liquid assets earning interest increased to million at december   from million reported at december  this increase was partially attributable to decreases in working capital in the company s recycling segment that resulted from lower pgm prices and lower inventories later in the year 
inventories and advances associated with recycling decreased to million at year end from million at the end of the company outstanding long term debt balance was million at december   up from million at december  the company replaced its debt facilities during  increasing the level of borrowings by about million 
the added borrowings helped the company accommodate significant growth in its recycling segment during the first nine months of interest expense declined to million in  from million in as the increased debt balances partially offset the benefit of much lower interest rates 
the expense included million of unamortized financing costs that were written off in conjunction with the company s refinancing 
total income tax provision the company recorded a small tax benefit of  in related to a refundable minimum tax credit and only a de minimis income tax expense in  reflecting certain state minimum taxes paid 
changes in the company s net deferred tax assets have been offset by the change in the related valuation allowance  as the company does not project any opportunity to benefit from its tax loss carry forwards 
other comprehensive income loss  net of tax the company recorded a gain in other comprehensive income of million in compared to a gain of million in the gain included million of realized hedging losses reclassified to income  partially offset by million representing the change in fair value of derivatives held  and million of unrealized losses on investments 
the gain included million of realized hedging losses reclassified to income  partially offset by million representing the change in fair value of derivatives held  and of unrealized gains on investments 
liquidity and capital resources for  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the company s net cash flow from operating activities is affected by several key factors  including net realized prices for its products  cash costs of production  and the level of pgm production from the mines 
the million reported loss for included million of non cash charges  including million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock compensation expense  million stock issuance expense related to the debt to equity transaction  and million of lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 
at december   the company s available balance of cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash was million and it reported million of debt outstanding 
if highly liquid short term investments are included with available cash  the company s balance sheet liquidity at december   increases to million 
corresponding balances at december   included million of available cash and cash equivalents  million of outstanding debt  and available cash plus liquid investments of million 
the company exchanged million face amount of its outstanding convertible debentures for about million common shares during the fourth quarter of the remaining million of convertible debentures will reach their date of first call in march  and the company believes most holders are likely to convert their debentures or redeem them at par at that time 
the company  at interest rate levels prevailing at december   will be required to fund approximately million in total interest payments during related to its outstanding debt obligations 
no principal payments against outstanding debt are scheduled to come due in in view of the current restrictive credit environment and relatively 
table of contents high risk spreads  the company has chosen not to put in place a revolving credit agreement at this time 
while the lack of a credit agreement may create some vulnerability  the company believes that its liquidity on hand is adequate to cover its needs for the foreseeable future 
during the fourth quarter of  the company filed a million shelf registration statement 
the registration became effective on december   and permits the company to issue any of various public debt or equity instruments for financing purposes so long as the registration statement remains effective 
the company has no immediate plans to issue securities under the shelf registration  but management believes that the shelf may facilitate access to additional liquidity in the future 
however  there is no assurance that debt or equity capital would be available to the company in the public markets should the company determine to issue securities under the shelf registration 
the company s financial performance is affected by changes in pgm prices 
at the pgm price levels prevailing at december   absent separate hedging arrangements  any change in the price of platinum generally would flow through almost dollar for dollar to cash flow from operations  subject only to price ceilings on of the mines platinum production to be sold under the company s sales agreement  and certain costs severance taxes and royalties on mine production which adjust upward or downward with market prices 
at the december   closing platinum price of  per ounce and production levels  the annual effect of the price ceiling would be to reduce the company s revenue by about million 
under the company s sales agreement for mined production  a change in the market price of palladium also would flow through directly to cash flow from operations  subject only to floor prices affecting of the company s sales from mine production  and an offset for severance taxes and royalties that are based on the realized price 
at the december   closing palladium price of per ounce  the contractual floor prices would have no effect on revenues 
in the company s recycling activities  upon purchasing recycled material for processing the company simultaneously enters into a fixed forward contract that determines the future selling price of the contained pgms  effectively locking in a sales margin 
so for outstanding recycling lots  a change in the market price of platinum and palladium on sales of recycling materials would have little or no effect on margins earned from this activity and on cash flow from operations 
however  a general change in market prices would affect margins on future purchases by about the same percentage as the change in price 
it normally takes existing lots of recycling material two to three months from the date of receipt to flow through to sales 
changes in the cash costs of production generally flow through dollar for dollar into cash flow from operations 
a reduction due to grade in total mine production of  or just over  ounces per year  would reduce cash flow from operations by an estimated million per year at the price and cost levels prevailing at december  net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company s investing activities primarily represent capital expenditures and net sales and purchases of short term investments 
capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company also expended million and million to acquire equity interests in two small exploration companies during and  respectively 
no exploration investments were made in all significant company wide repair and maintenance costs in connection with planned major maintenance activities are expensed as incurred 
the company does not accrue in advance for major maintenance activities  but  when practicable  tries to disclose in advance in its public filings any planned major maintenance activities that may affect operations 
net cash used in financing activities was a net million and million in and  respectively  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in convertible debentures on march   the company issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible debentures due debentures 
the debentures pay interest at per annum  payable semi annually on march and september of each year  commencing september  the debentures will mature on march   subject to earlier repurchase or conversion 
each  principal amount of debentures is initially convertible  at the option of the holders  into approximately shares of the company s common stock  at any time prior to the 
table of contents maturity date 
the conversion rate is subject to certain adjustments  but will not be adjusted for accrued interest or any unpaid interest 
the conversion rate initially represents a conversion price of per share 
holders of the debentures may require the company to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures on march   march  and march   or upon the occurrence of certain events including a change in control 
the company may redeem the debentures for cash beginning on or after march  the debentures were sold to an accredited investor within the meaning of rule under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  in reliance upon the private placement exemption afforded by section of the securities act 
the initial investor offered and resold the debentures to qualified institutional buyers under rule a of the securities act 
an affiliate of mmc norilsk nickel  with the approval of the company s independent directors  purchased million of the debentures  thereby maintaining its majority ownership position in the company 
in october  the company undertook the exchange of million face amount of the convertible debentures in exchange for million shares of the company s common stock 
the debentures so acquired have been retired  leaving million face value of the debentures outstanding at december  contractual obligations the company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as its debt agreements

critical accounting policies mine development expenditures capitalization and amortization mining operations are inherently capital intensive  generally requiring substantial capital investment for the initial and concurrent development and infrastructure of the mine 
many of these expenditures are necessarily incurred well in advance of actual extraction of ore 
underground mining operations such as those conducted by the company require driving tunnels and sinking shafts that provide access to the underground ore body and construction and development of infrastructure  including electrical and ventilation systems  rail and other forms of transportation  shop facilities  material handling areas and hoisting systems 
ore mining and removal operations require significant underground facilities used to conduct mining operations and to transport the ore out of the mine to processing facilities located above ground 
contemporaneously with mining  additional development is undertaken to provide access to ongoing extensions of the ore body  allowing more ore to be produced 
in addition to the development costs that have been previously incurred  these ongoing development expenditures are necessary to access and support all future mining activities 
mine development expenditures incurred to date to increase existing production  develop new ore bodies or develop mineral property substantially in advance of production are capitalized 
mine development expenditures consist of vertical shafts  multiple surface adits and underground infrastructure development including footwall laterals  ramps  rail and transportation  electrical and ventilation systems  shop facilities  material handling areas  ore handling facilities  dewatering and pumping facilities 
many such facilities are required not only for current operations  but also for all future planned operations 
expenditures incurred to sustain existing production and access specific ore reserve blocks or stopes provide benefit to ore reserve production over limited periods of time secondary development and are charged to operations as incurred 
these costs include ramp and stope access excavations from primary haulage levels footwall laterals  stope material rehandling laydown excavations  stope ore and waste pass excavations and chute installations  stope ventilation raise excavations and stope utility and pipe raise excavations 
the company calculates amortization of capitalized mine development costs by the application of an amortization rate to current production 
the amortization rate is based upon un amortized capitalized mine development costs  and the related ore reserves 
capital development expenditures are added to the un amortized capitalized mine development costs as the related assets are placed into service 
in the calculation of the amortization rate  changes in ore reserves are accounted for as a prospective change in estimate 
ore reserves and the further benefit of capitalized mine development costs are based on significant management assumptions 
any changes in these assumptions  such as a change in the mine plan or a change in estimated proven and probable ore reserves could have a material effect on the expected period of benefit resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuations of related assets 
the company s proven ore reserves are generally expected to be extracted utilizing its existing mine development infrastructure 
additional capital expenditures will be required to access the company s estimated probable ore reserves 
these anticipated capital expenditures are not included in the current calculation of depreciation and amortization 
the company s method of accounting for development costs is as follows unamortized costs of the shaft at the stillwater mine and the initial development at the east boulder mine are treated as life of mine infrastructure costs  amortized over total proven and probable reserves at each location  and all ongoing development costs of footwall laterals  ramps and associated facilities are amortized over the ore reserves in the immediate and geologically relevant vicinity of the development 
the calculation of the amortization rate  and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations  could be materially affected to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable ore reserves 
this would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining ore reserves 
these factors could include an expansion of proven and probable ore reserves through development activities  differences between estimated and actual costs of mining due to differences in grade or metal recovery rates  and differences between actual commodity prices and commodity 
table of contents price assumptions used in the estimation of ore reserves 
asset impairment the company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
the estimation of future cash flows takes into account estimates of recoverable ounces  pgm prices long term sales contract prices and historical pricing trends or third party projections of future prices rather than prices at a point in time as an indicator of longer term future prices  production levels  and capital and reclamation expenditures  all based on life of mine plans and projections 
if the assets are impaired  a calculation of fair market value is performed  and if fair market value is lower than the carrying value of the assets  the assets are reduced to their fair market value 
income taxes income taxes are determined using the asset and liability approach 
this method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax rates 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
each quarter  management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
a valuation allowance has been provided at december  and  for the portion of the company s net deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
based on the company s current financial projections  and in view of the level of tax depreciation and depletion deductions available  it appears unlikely that the company will owe any income taxes for the foreseeable future 
however  if average realized pgm prices were to increase substantially in the future  the company could owe income taxes prospectively on the resulting higher taxable income 
post closure reclamation costs the company recognizes the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation ultimately is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss at the time of settlement 
accounting for reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates for each mining operation of the future costs the company will incur to complete final reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work that the company is required to perform 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation 
the company reviewed its asset retirement assumptions at december   and recorded a reduction of million and million for the stillwater mine and the east boulder mine  respectively  due to an increase in the estimated mine lives of both mines 
see note asset retirement obligation to the company s audited financial statements for further information 
derivative instruments the company from time to time enters into derivative financial instruments  including fixed forward sales  cashless put and call option collars and financially settled forward sales to manage the effect of changes in the prices of palladium and platinum on the company s revenue 
derivatives are reported on the balance sheet at fair value and  if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
if the 
table of contents derivative is designated as a hedge and to the extent such hedge is determined to be highly effective  changes in fair value are either a offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability if applicable or b reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in the determination of net income in the period the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
the company primarily uses derivatives to hedge metal prices and to manage interest rate risk 
the company also enters into financially settled forwards related to its recycling segment which are not accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the realized and unrealized gains or losses are recognized in net income in each period 
see note derivative instruments to the company s audited financial statements for further information 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in metal prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces and sells palladium  platinum and associated by product metals directly to its customers and also through third parties 
as a result  financial performance can be materially affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
in order to manage commodity price risk and to reduce the impact of fluctuation in prices  the company enters into long term contracts and from time to time uses various derivative financial instruments 
because the company hedges only with instruments that have a high correlation with the value of the hedged transactions  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the value of the hedged transaction 
the company has a sales agreement with ford motor company that covers a significant portion of the company s mined pgm production through december and stipulates floor and ceiling prices for metal delivered 
the company from time to time also purchases platinum and rhodium in the open market for resale under various supply arrangements 
see business  risk factors and properties current operations pgm sales and hedging and note derivative instruments to the company s audited financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company s open positions 
in july of  a long term pgm supply agreement between the company and general motors corporation was rejected by general motors through its bankruptcy process 
this agreement contained guaranteed minimum selling prices for palladium ounces delivered under the agreement that provided the company with a measure of financial protection during periods of low palladium prices 
while the company did not incur any direct financial loss during as a result of the rejection of the general motors supply agreement  loss of the agreement does increase the company s exposure to pgm market volatility on about of its mined palladium sales 
the company s remaining long term automotive supply agreement with ford motor company is scheduled to expire on december  the floor prices in that agreement apply to of the company s mined platinum ounces and of the company s mined palladium ounces 
if the ford agreement is not renegotiated or replaced on terms similar to those in the existing agreement  then once the existing agreement expires  the company s mining revenues will be fully exposed to prevailing market prices 
in the current economic environment  the company believes it is unlikely that any replacement pgm supply agreement  whether or not with ford  will include terms comparable to those in the existing agreement 
consequently  without these pricing provisions  the risk will increase that the company may not be able to operate profitably during future downturns in pgm prices 
the fair value of the company s principal long lived assets is determined in part by the value the market assigns to the company s underlying ore reserves 
these values are sensitive to changes in market prices for pgms 
the company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of its assets may not be recoverable 
the company has reviewed its operations at december   and concluded that there was no material event or change in circumstances that would require a review of the company s long lived assets for impairment 
upon performing a similar review at december   the company recorded an impairment provision reducing the east boulder operations carrying value by million in in the future  if pgm prices were to decline and remain depressed for a sustained period  the company could face additional impairment adjustments to the carrying values of its long lived assets 

table of contents the company from time to time enters into fixed forward sales and financially settled forward sales transactions that may or may not be accounted for as cash flow hedges to mitigate the price risk in its pgm recycling and mine production activities 
in fixed forward transactions  normally metals contained in spent catalytic materials are sold forward at the time the materials are purchased and then are delivered against the fixed forward contracts when the finished ounces are recovered 
the company has elected to account for these transactions as normal purchases and normal sales 
financially settled forward sales provide another mechanism to offset fluctuations in metal prices associated with future production  particularly in circumstances where the company elects to retain control of the final disposition of the metal 
in financially settled forward sales  the parties agree in advance to a net financial settlement in the future based on the difference between the market price of the metal on the settlement date and a forward price set at inception 
consequently  at the settlement date  the company receives the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is below the forward price  and the company pays the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is above the forward price 
no metal changes hands between the parties in these financially settled transactions 
the company generally has accounted for financial settled forward transactions as cash flow hedges 
however  if the company determines not to document them as cash flow hedges  these transactions are marked to market in each accounting period and the realized and unrealized gains or losses are recognized in net income in each period 
as of december  and  the company was not party to any financially settled forward agreements 
from time to time the company also enters into financially settled forwards related to its recycling segment which are not accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the realized and unrealized gains or losses are recognized in net income in each period 
all commodity instruments outstanding at december   are expected to be settled within the next five months 
see note derivative instruments to the company s audited financial statements for further information 
interest rate risk at december   all of the company s outstanding long term debt was subject to fixed rates of interest 
interest income on payments to the company s recycling suppliers is generally linked to short term inter bank rates 
the company s convertible debentures do not contain financial covenants  other than change in control protection and investor make whole provisions 
consequently  the company is not subject to conventional financial covenants at this time 
the company s financial performance depends significantly on the automotive industry s need for pgms in catalytic converters 
generally  about of the demand for palladium and platinum is generated by catalytic converter requirements 
should existing or future regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions result in a substantial longer term shift away from internal combustion engines in automobiles  the resulting drop in demand could depress pgm prices and impair the company s financial performance
