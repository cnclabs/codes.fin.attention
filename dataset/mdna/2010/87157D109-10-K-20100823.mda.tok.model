table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and factors that may affect results you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a 
risk factors 
overview we are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom designed human interface solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing  communications  entertainment  and other electronic devices 
we believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus  the strength of our intellectual property  and our engineering know how  which allow us to develop or engineer products that meet the demanding design specifications of oems 
we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or title has transferred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
our net revenue increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
for fiscal  we derived of our net revenue from the personal computer market 
for fiscal  revenue from the personal computer market accounted for of our net revenue 
many of our customers have migrated their manufacturing operations from taiwan to china  and many of our oem customers have established design centers in that region 
with our expanded global presence  including offices in canada  china  finland  hong kong  japan  korea  switzerland  taiwan  and the united states  we are well positioned to provide local sales  operational  and engineering support services to our existing customers  as well as potential new customers  on a global basis 
our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers facilities  eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories 
this approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements 
we provide our contract manufacturers with six month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next days 
however  we do not have any long term supply contracts with any of our contract manufacturers 
we use three third party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and two third party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary asics 
in certain cases  we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products 
our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products  including materials  logistics  manufacturing  assembly  and test costs paid to third party manufacturers and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel 
additionally  we charge all warranty costs  yield losses  and any inventory provisions or write downs to cost of revenue 
our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our oem customers products in meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost improvement programs 
these cost improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements 
our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products  which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost improvement programs 
as a result  new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin 
our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development  as well as the engineering costs incurred to design human interface solutions for oem customers prior to and after their commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products 
these expenses have generally increased  reflecting our continuing commitment to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets 

table of contents selling  general  and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales  marketing  and administrative personnel  internal sales and outside sales representatives commissions  market and usability research  outside legal  accounting  and consulting costs  and other marketing and sales activities 
these expenses have generally increased  primarily reflecting incremental staffing and related support costs associated with our increased business levels  growth in our existing markets  and penetration into new markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  cost of revenue  inventories  product warranty  provision for income taxes  income taxes payable  intangible assets  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  applicable laws  and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the methods  estimates  interpretations  and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the sec considers an entity s most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of the entity s financial condition and results of operations and those that require the entity s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or title has transferred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we accrue for estimated sales returns and other allowances  based on historical experience  at the time we recognize revenue 
investments accounting standards require us to record available for sale securities at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses being reported as a component of other comprehensive income 
we follow the accounting standards to assess whether our investments with loss positions are other than temporarily impaired 
we follow the hierarchal approach established under the accounting standards to determine fair value of our investments  which we adopted at the beginning of fiscal the accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
our fair value estimates consider  among other factors  the collateral underlying the security investments  creditworthiness of the counterparty  timing of expected future cash flows  and  in the case of auction rate securities  or ars investments  the probability of a successful auction in a future period 
we follow the guidance provided to estimate fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability  and to determine circumstances that may indicate that a transaction is not orderly 
further  we use judgment in evaluating whether a decline in fair value is temporary or other than temporary and consider the following indicators changes in credit ratings or asset quality  changes in the economic environment  length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis  changes in market conditions  changes in expected cash flows 
we do not intend to sell the investments and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis 
temporary declines in fair value are recorded as charges to accumulated other comprehensive income in the equity section of our balance sheet  while other than temporary declines in fair value are bifurcated between credit losses  which are charged to earnings  and noncredit losses  which depending on facts and circumstances may be charged to other comprehensive income or earnings 

table of contents inventory we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we base our assessment of the ultimate realization of inventories on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
sudden declines in demand  rapid product improvements  or technological changes  or any combination of these factors can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the following factors influence our estimates changes to or cancellations of customer orders  unexpected decline in demand  rapid product improvements and technological advances  and termination or changes by our oem customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions 
periodically  we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order 
in those circumstances in which our customer has cancelled its order and we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers  we consider a write down to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value 
we charge write downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete  slow moving  and non usable inventory to net realizable value to cost of revenue 
the effect of these write downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory  which we do not subsequently write up 
share based compensation costs we account for employee share based compensation costs in accordance with relevant accounting standards 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of employee share based compensatory awards  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected volatility and expected life 
historical and implied volatilities were used in estimating the fair value of our share based awards  while the expected life for our options was estimated based on historical trends since our initial public offering 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
further  as required under relevant accounting standards  we estimate forfeitures for share based awards that are not expected to vest 
we charge the estimated fair value less estimated forfeitures to earnings on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying awards  which is generally four years for our stock options and deferred stock units and up to two years for our employee stock purchase plan 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
as our stock option and employee stock purchase plan awards have characteristics that differ significantly from traded options  and as changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  our estimate of fair value may not accurately represent the value assigned by a third party in an arms length transaction 
there currently is no market based mechanism to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates derived from the black scholes option pricing model or other allowable valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
while our estimate of fair value and the associated charge to earnings materially affects our results of operations  it has no impact on our cash position 
there are significant variations among allowable valuation models  and there is a possibility that we may adopt a different valuation model or refine the inputs and assumptions under our current valuation model in the future  resulting in a lack of consistency in future periods 
our current or future valuation model and the inputs and assumptions we make may also lack comparability to other companies that use different models  inputs  or assumptions  and the resulting differences in comparability could be material 
income taxes we recognize federal  foreign  and state current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the then current fiscal year for each tax jurisdiction 
we also recognize federal  foreign  and state deferred tax liabilities or assets for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and our judgment  are not expected to be realized 
if our assumptions  and consequently our estimates  change in the future  the valuation allowance we have established for our deferred tax assets may be changed  which could impact income tax expense 

table of contents we use a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  result of operations  or cash flows 
we believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties 
however  our results have in the past  and could in the future  include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved  upon the filing of an amended return  upon a change in facts  circumstances  or interpretation  or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation 
accordingly  our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period 
we recognize tax benefit upon expensing nonqualified stock options and deferred stock units issued under our share based compensation plans 
however  under current accounting standards  we cannot recognize tax benefit concurrent with expensing incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares qualified stock options issued under our share based compensation plans 
for qualified stock options that vested after our adoption of new accounting standards  we recognize tax benefit only in the period when disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock occur  which historically has been up to several years after vesting and in periods when our stock price substantially increases 
for qualified stock options that vested prior to our adoption of new accounting standards  we record the tax benefit directly to additional paid in capital 
accordingly  because we cannot recognize the tax benefit for share based compensation expense associated with qualified stock options until the occurrence of future disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock and such disqualified dispositions may happen in periods when our stock price substantially increases  and because a portion of that tax benefit may be directly recorded to additional paid in capital  our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates will be subject to greater volatility and  consequently  our ability to estimate reasonably our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates is greatly diminished

we have registered an aggregate of million of common stock including the associated rights  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares  warrants  purchase contracts  and units collectively securities for issuance to raise funds for general corporate purposes  which may include the repayment of indebtedness outstanding from time to time  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and repurchases of our common stock or other securities 
securities issued under the shelf registration generally will be freely tradeable after their issuance unless held by an affiliate of our company  in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of rule million shelf registration 
we have registered an aggregate of million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions  which shares generally will be freely tradeable after their issuance under rule of the securities act unless held by an affiliate of the acquired company  in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of rule liquidity and capital resources 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements over the course of at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our revenue  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  costs related to protecting our intellectual property  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  our common stock purchase program  and the amount and timing of our investments in  or acquisitions of  other technologies or companies 
further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unexpected business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained 
our non current investments consist of ars investments  which have failed to settle in auctions 
these failures generally resulted in the interest rates resetting from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points on the regularly scheduled auction dates 
these investments are not liquid  and in the event we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal  unless a future auction on these investments is successful 
as of fiscal year end  the fair value of our ars investments was million and had an original cost basis of million 
during fiscal  million of our ars investments were redeemed at par and we recognized a gain of  on the redemption  which was included in impairment of investments  net on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
in connection with our fair value analysis for fiscal  we recorded a million other than temporary impairment charge 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as usual

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents  and auction rate securities 
our current investment portfolio consists primarily of government backed securities and investment grade instruments  and we would not expect the fair value of our investments to be significantly affected by changes in market interest rates  however  our interest income will fluctuate with changes in market interest rates 
we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our cash equivalents  investments  and debt obligations as of the end of fiscal in thousands  except for average interest rates fair fiscal year ended june thereafter total value assets cash equivalents variable rate money market average interest rate total cash equivalents average interest rate non current investments average interest rate liabilities convertible senior subordinated notes fixed rate amounts average interest rate our convertible senior subordinated notes bear a fixed coupon interest rate of and mature in december the noteholders could require us to repurchase their notes on december   december  or in the event of a fundamental change as described in the indenture governing the notes 
the early repayment of the notes is not reflected in the preceding schedule 
our non current investments  which consist of ars investments  have a par value of million and have failed to settle in auctions beginning in september these investments are not liquid  and in the event we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal  unless redeemed by the issuers or a future auction on these investments is successful 
during fiscal  million of our ars investments were redeemed at par and we recognized a gain of  on the redemption of these investments  which is included in impairment of investments  net on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
as there are currently no active markets for our various failed ars investments  we have estimated the fair value of these investments as of the end of fiscal based on a trinomial discounted cash flow analysis 
the analysis considered  among other factors the collateral underlying the security investments  creditworthiness of the counterparty  timing of expected future cash flows  the probability of a successful auction in a future period  the underlying structure of each investment  the present value of future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions  consideration of the probabilities of default  passing a future auction  or redemption at par for each period  and estimates of the recovery rates in the event of default for each investment 

table of contents when possible  our failed ars investments were compared to other observable market data or securities with similar characteristics 
our estimate of the fair value of our ars investments could change materially from period to period based on future market conditions 
contractual maturities for our ars investments are generally greater than five years  with fair value of million maturing from fiscal to fiscal  million maturing from fiscal to fiscal  and million maturing thereafter or having no stated maturity 
of our ars investments million par value are investment grade  and the remaining million par value are below investment grade 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as usual 
there have been no significant changes in the maturity dates and average interest rates for our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio and debt obligations subsequent to fiscal foreign currency exchange risk all of our revenue and approximately of our consolidated costs are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been immaterial to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the future  if our operations change and we determine that our foreign exchange exposure has increased  we may consider entering into hedging transactions to mitigate such risk
