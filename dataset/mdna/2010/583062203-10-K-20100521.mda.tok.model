item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
industry overview market size data for the consumer optics industry are difficult to obtain because nearly all of the companies in the industry are privately held 
the company believes the overall size of the consumer optics market is driven  in part  by the introduction of new products 
the company offers products at numerous price points in the consumer optics market  from advanced astronomical telescopes and cutting edge binoculars to less expensive telescopes for beginning amateur astronomers and low priced binoculars for the casual user 
the advanced astronomical telescope market is characterized by frequent technological developments  including the relatively recent introduction of innovative optical designs and computer aided features 
serious amateur astronomers demand that the optical  electronic and mechanical performance of the telescopes and accessories they purchase be of very high quality 
these advanced telescopes continue to drive the technological advances specifically in the telescope industry and generally in the consumer optics industry 
telescopes are generally offered in three different optical configurations a refracting telescopes  which use lenses to collect light  b reflecting telescopes  which use mirrors as the primary optical element  and c catadioptric mirror lens telescopes  which employ a combination of mirrors and lenses to form the image 
each type has its own advantages refractors are easy to maintain  yield sharp images and are generally relatively inexpensive in smaller apertures  reflectors generally are the lowest cost means of purchasing larger apertures and are well suited to the intermediate amateur astronomer  and mirror lens telescopes are more portable 
the binocular market is typically characterized less by technological developments than by styling  features quality and price 
the principal features generally considered by binocular buyers include the diameter of the objective lenses  which serve to collect light  the types of prisms used to right the visual image either porro prisms which give some binoculars the familiar zig zag profile or roof prisms that permit straight line designs  and the magnification  or power  of the optical system 
a binoculars field of view  anti reflective lens coatings and eye relief are also considered by consumers buying binoculars 
binoculars typically range in size from mini binoculars that generally have objective lenses not larger than mm to professional level binoculars that can support objective lenses exceeding mm in diameter 
binocular retail prices range from under ten dollars to several thousand dollars 
the company s binoculars offered under the meade brand name  as well as under various private label names  generally sell for between and at retail 

table of contents the company believes that it is well positioned in the marketplace to capitalize on its strong brand names  its research and development resources  its history of innovation and its manufacturing capabilities to bring new and innovative products to market 
products the company has developed and expanded its product line to include a full line of telescopes and accessories for the beginning  intermediate and serious amateur astronomer 
the company offers a complete line of binoculars from small aperture theater glasses to full size waterproof roof prism glasses 
moreover  in addition to adding new products  the company continually refines and improves its existing products 
certain of the company s products are described in greater detail below advanced astronomical telescopes 
among the company s most sophisticated products are its lx series acf and schmidt cassegrain telescopes 
the lx telescopes incorporate optical systems that provide high quality resolution  contrast and light transmission and offer the serious amateur astronomer a broad range of products  from the attractively priced autostar controlled lxgps  to the state of the art lx lines 
the lx telescopes  available in    and inch apertures  are the most popular of the company s telescopes among serious amateur astronomers 
the lx telescopes feature the company s proprietary acf optics  a global positioning system gps receiver for automatic telescope alignment and a built in computer library of more than  celestial objects 
these objects are cataloged in the company s proprietary hand held computerized autostar ii control system 
by entering any of the celestial objects presented on the autostar ii display  the telescope automatically locates and tracks the selected object 
advanced telescopes also include the company s lxgps  a moderately priced line of schmidt cassegrain telescopes available in  and inch apertures 
the company s lxd series and truss dobsonian telescopes offer the more serious amateur a wide variety of advanced features on larger aperture telescopes at economical prices 
with the acquisition of coronado in december  the company added sophisticated  dedicated solar viewing telescopes to its advanced telescope lines 
the solarmax telescopes  ranging in aperture from mm to mm  feature coronado s patented hydrogen alpha h alpha etalon filters 
coronado s h alpha etalons isolate the hydrogen alpha wavelength while rejecting all others allowing naked eye observation of the sun  its flares  prominences  filaments  spiculae  faculae  and active regions 
advanced astronomical telescopes collectively represented approximately and  of telescope units shipped and approximately and of the company s net sales for the years ended february  and february   respectively 
entry level telescopes 
designed specifically for the beginning to intermediate amateur astronomer or terrestrial observer  the company s less expensive mm to mm refracting  reflecting and spotting scopes and the etx series telescopes include many of the features of the more advanced telescopes at economical prices 
meade s revolutionary ls lightswitch series of telecopes use advanced technologies like gps  lnt and eclips ccd imaging  and automatically aligns itself with ultimate tracking and pointing accuracy 
also  new lt is a fully featured computer controlled ideal telescope for any astronomer who demands superior optics  mechanics and computer controlled in a compact  high performance package 
with the ng and ngc series of telescopes the ng telescopes and the digital electronic series telescopes the ds telescopes  with apertures ranging from mm to mm  and the etx series  with apertures ranging from mm to mm  some of the most sophisticated features of the company s advanced telescopes are made available at some of the company s lowest retail price points 
equipped with the hand held autostar computer controller  the etx series and the ds telescopes can find and track any one of one thousand or more celestial objects at the push of a button 
the autostar  with its go to capability  brings to the general consumer  for prices starting at a few hundred dollars  features that have previously been available only on the most sophisticated high end telescopes selling for thousands of dollars 
the company offers several variations of its small refracting and reflecting telescopes including its traditional models  the ng telescopes and the ds telescopes for distribution on a semi exclusive basis to specific specialty retailers 
the company also has a solar viewing telescope in its entry level offerings  the coronado personal solar telescope pst 
the pst is a mm dedicated solar telescope that makes solar viewing possible at a more consumer friendly price 
the pst uses a filtering technology similar to that which goes into a solarmax telescope but with unique design characteristics that allow for a lower price to the consumer 
these various telescope models comprise the lower priced end of the company s telescope product lines 
sales of entry level telescopes comprised approximately and of the company s telescope units shipped and approximately and of the company s net sales for the years ended february  and february   respectively 

table of contents binoculars 
the company sells a complete line of consumer binoculars through its domestic distribution network under the meade brand name 
the binoculars sold by the company are purchased from manufacturers outside the united states 
binocular sales in each of the years ended february  and february  represented approximately and of the company s net sales during those fiscal years  respectively 
accessories 
the company also offers accessories for each of its principal product lines that range from additional eyepieces and multi media celestial observation guides to software that enhances the consumer s telescope experience 
the coronado brand adds several high end h alpha etalon filters to the list of telescope accessories for the serious amateur astronomer 
sales of accessories represented approximately and of the company s net sales for the years ended february  and february   respectively 
other consumer optical products accounted for approximately and of the company s net sales for the years ended february  and february   respectively 
operations supply chain management 
management of the supply chain is critical to complete and on time delivery of the company s products to its customers 
the company works closely with factories primarily in china to develop proprietary product designs 
many of the company s products purchased during the two fiscal years ended february  were supplied by chinese manufacturers 
the company owns many of the key designs  molds and dies used by such suppliers 
the company also utilizes its facility in tijuana  mexico 
this facility employs over people which varies based upon product sales levels and seasonal demand engaged in the manufacture and assembly of telescopes  electronic sub assemblies  and accessory products 
materials and supplies 
the company purchases high grade optical glass for its higher end telescopes in order to avoid imperfections that can degrade optical performance 
lenses and mirrors for the company s internally manufactured telescopes are individually polished and figured by master opticians to precise tolerances to achieve a high level of resolution 
the company purchases metal telescope components from numerous foundries  metal stamping and metal working companies 
certain of the company s products contain computerized drive systems and other electronic circuitry 
the components of these computerized drive and electronic systems are purchased from various suppliers and are generally assembled by third party vendors 
optical testing 
as each of meade s acf and schmidt cassegrain optical sets  or parabolic newtonian primary telescope mirrors  progress through the grinding  polishing and figuring stages of development  they are repeatedly tested and re tested for irregularities  smoothness of figure and correction 
optical testing of the company s products produced outside of the united states is performed by trained optical technicians to comply with strict quality standards 
the company maintains strict quality standards for all of its optics included in the company s products from telescopes and eyepieces to binoculars 
optical alignment and centration 
finished  individually matched and figured high end optical sets are sent to the optical alignment and centration process  where each optical set is placed into a special optical tube that permits rotation of the optical elements about their optical axes 
a variation of this alignment and centration process is performed on all of the company s optical products 
intellectual property the company relies on a combination of patents  trademarks and trade secrets to establish and protect its proprietary rights and its technology 
in general  the company pursues patent protection both in the united states and selected foreign countries for subject matter considered patentable and important to the company s business strategy 
the company has patents either issued and or pending in the us and in several foreign jurisdictions including europe  australia  canada  japan and china 

table of contents generally  patents issued in the us are effective for years from the original date of application 
the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with applicable foreign local law 
while the duration of the company s patents varies  most of its most important patents have been issued within the last ten years 
the company believes that its patents  proprietary technology  know how and trademarks provide significant protection for the company s competitive position  and the company intends to protect and enforce its intellectual property assets 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or infringement of its technologies or that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technologies 
effective protection of intellectual property rights may be limited or unavailable in certain foreign countries 
seasonality the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  substantial fluctuations in its sales  gross margins and results from operations from quarter to quarter 
factors that influence these fluctuations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  market acceptance of the company s products  competitive pricing pressures  the company s ability to meet fluctuating demand and delivery schedules  the timing and extent of research and development expenses  the timing and extent of product development activities and the timing and extent of advertising expenditures 
historically  a substantial portion of the company s net sales and results from operations typically occurred in the third quarter of the company s fiscal year primarily due to the disproportionately higher sales of its discontinued operations in europe  as well as higher customer demand for less expensive telescopes during the holiday season 
mass merchandisers  along with specialty retailers  purchase a considerable amount of their inventories to satisfy seasonal customer demand 
these purchasing patterns have caused the company to increase its level of inventory during its second and third quarters in response to such demand or anticipated demand 
as a result  the company s working capital requirements have correspondingly increased at such times 
however  the company s net sales during its third quarter of fiscal were not greater than its second quarter 
while seasonality is not as pronounced as it was prior to the sale of meade europe  the company continues to experience significant sales to mass merchandisers 
accordingly  the company s net sales and results from operations are expected to be higher in its second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters of its fiscal year 
sales and marketing the company s products are sold through a domestic network of mail order and internet dealers  specialty retailers  distributors and mass merchandisers 
internationally  the company s products are sold through a network of foreign distributors  including meade europe  and dealers in other countries around the world 
the company s high end telescopes are generally sold through mail order and internet dealers or single and multiple location specialty retailers 
meade s less expensive telescopes are sold in similar venues but are sold principally through mass merchandisers 
the company s binoculars are sold principally through a network of domestic distributors  as well as through specialty retailers and mass merchandisers 
the company maintains direct contact with its larger dealers and its domestic and foreign distributors through the company s sales professionals 
a network of independent representatives is used to maintain contact with its smaller specialty retailers 
included among the company s customers are costco  sam s club and target 
the company s sales force works closely with its dealers  specialty retailers  distributors and mass merchandisers on product quality  technical knowledge and customer service 
the company employs a sales and customer service force trained to assist the company s customers in all facets of its products operations 
the company s internal sales personnel are supplemented by a network of regional sales representatives 
together  these individuals advise the company s specialty retailers about the quality features of the company s products and provide answers to questions from specialty retailers as well as directly from end users of the company s products 
the company stresses service to both its customers and end users by providing marketing assistance in the form of hang tags  catalog layouts and other print media as well as dedicated toll free customer service telephone numbers 
in addition to giving its customers personal attention  the company believes toll free telephone numbers also help reduce the number of product returns from end users who are generally unfamiliar with the assembly and operation of telescopes and binoculars 
management believes the company s dedication to providing a high level of customer service is one factor that sets meade apart from its competition 

table of contents the company s telescope products are regularly advertised in all major domestic and most international telescope and astronomy related magazines with comprehensive  full color  technically informative advertisements which present a consistent message of innovation and quality about the company and its products 
the company also focuses advertising dollars on point of sale promotions and displays in partnership with its retail customers to jointly market the company s products to the end consumer 
throughout fiscal  the company sold its products to mail order dealers  to distributors  and to more than specialty retailers and mass merchandisers that offer the company s products in more than  retail store outlets 
during the fiscal year ended  walmart including sam s club  accounted for approximately of the company s net sales 
in fiscal  not including sam s club  walmart accounted for approximately of net sales 
the company s ten largest customers  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately and of the company s net sales for the years ended february  and february   respectively 
the loss of any significant portion of the sales made to any significant customer could adversely affect the results of operations of the company to the extent the company is not able to replace any such lost sales with increased sales to existing or new customers 
competitive strengths the company believes that it derives significant benefits from its position as a leading designer and distributor of telescopes  binoculars  spotting scopes  and other consumer optical related products 
these benefits include its ability to offer its customers a broad and innovative  product line embodying both high quality and value 
the company believes it has the following competitive strengths new products research and development 
the company places a primary emphasis on product innovation and quality through its research and development efforts 
the company employs an in house engineering staff at its irvine and tijuana  mexico facilities that develops new products and applies technological advances and improvements to existing products 
the company is able to obtain additional benefits by out sourcing certain research and development services to supplement its internal expertise 
the company  its management and its employees are dedicated to the goal of producing technically superior yet price competitive products and have been responsible for some of the consumer optics industry s most technically advanced  easy to use  consumer optical products 
broad line of products 
the company offers numerous different telescope  spotting scope and binocular models with several different optical configurations  as well as hundreds of accessory products for the consumer optics and sports optics buyers 
the company s telescopes range in aperture from under to inches and in retail price from less than to almost  the company offers several families of binoculars including digital camera binoculars under its several brand names at retail price points from about to approximately whether a consumer is a serious amateur astronomer or someone just looking for a good binocular  meade offers a wide range of quality products to satisfy the consumer optics buyer 
optical systems expertise 
the company has made substantial investments to develop an expertise in optical engineering  providing it with the ability to produce high quality optics 
the company employs highly skilled opticians who use sophisticated manufacturing techniques and equipment  including specialized optical polishing machines and vacuum coating machines  to produce what the company believes to be the highest quality optics available in the more advanced consumer telescope market 
the company uses its optical engineering expertise to ensure that the optics in its foreign sourced products meet the strictest of standards 
quality control 
the company s manufacturing and engineering personnel coordinate and oversee the manufacturing process in order to ensure that product quality is maintained at a high level within an efficient cost structure 
the company has in place quality controls covering all aspects of the manufacturing process of its products  from each product s precision optical system to its final assembly and testing 
parts and components for the advanced telescopes are manufactured and assembled in our mexico facilities 
the company s binoculars  microscopes and many of its less expensive telescopes  as well as certain component parts for its small to midrange telescopes  are manufactured under our proprietary designs by manufacturers located in asia 

table of contents broad distribution network 
the company s sales force works closely with specialty retailers  distributors and mass merchandisers on product quality  technical knowledge and customer service 
meade has its own on site graphic arts department in irvine  ca to work with specialty retailers  distributors and mass merchandisers to produce print advertising  hang tags for displays within retail outlets and other point of sale support 
this capability provides the company s customers with a comprehensive marketing program to assist in their sales efforts 
as a result of these efforts  the company has become a major supplier of consumer optics to such major retailers as sam s club  costco and target 
superior customer service 
the company believes that its high level of customer service and technical support are important factors that differentiate it from its competitors 
in addition to providing toll free phone access to customers in an effort to provide superior post sale service  meade has consolidated its various customer service departments and increased its technical support staff for all of its product offerings 
communications infrastructure has been upgraded with a new phone system integrated with crm software  and an on line automated service request system that tracks repairs and replacement parts while automatically reporting back to the customer that submitted the request 
the company s internet support pages also include video how to instruction for many of the company s products  as well as technical manuals to further educate users about product operation 
competition the consumer optics market is competitive and sensitive to consumer needs and preferences 
in the telescope market  the company competes in the united states and canada with sw technology corporation celestron  and bushnell performance optics  inc bushnell and  to a lesser extent  with other smaller companies which service niche markets 
in april  sw technology corporation a delaware corporation  an affiliate of synta technology corporation of taiwan  a long time supplier to celestron  acquired all of the outstanding members ownership interests in celestron acquisition llc 
the company has seen increased pricing pressure as a result of the change in ownership at celestron 
in europe and japan  the company competes primarily with celestron  vixen optical industries  ltd  and with other smaller regional telescope importers and manufacturers 
some of the company s current and potential competitors in the telescope market may possess greater financial or technical resources and competitive cost advantages due to a number of factors  including  without limitation  lower taxes and lower costs of labor associated with manufacturing 
the binocular market is generally more competitive than the telescope market with a greater number of competitors at each price point 
in the binocular market  the company competes primarily with bushnell  nikon inc  pentax corporation and various smaller manufacturers and resellers 
many of these competitors in the binocular market have significantly greater brand name recognition and financial and technical resources than those of the company  and many have long standing positions  customer relationships and established brand names in their respective markets 
employees as of february   the company had approximately full time employees  worldwide 
the company believes that it offers competitive compensation and benefits and that its employee relations are good 
none of the company s united states based employees is represented by a union 
the company s employees at the mexico facility are represented by a union 
the success of the company s future operations depends in large part on the company s ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  marketing and management personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such key personnel

item a 
risk factors we have in the past and may in the future incur losses despite our efforts to restructure our business in an effort to return to profitability 
we have incurred significant net losses since fiscal during fiscal and fiscal  we took several actions to restructure and reduce our business operations  overhead structure and improve our financial position in an effort to return our company to profitability and ensure it has appropriate liquidity to fund its continuing operations 
these actions included moving our manufacturing from california to mexico  lowering our administrative expenses by reducing our executive team and employee headcount  monetizing certain assets and selling meade europe 
however  we cannot assure you that our restructuring actions will be adequate to achieve or sustain profitability 
our ability to borrow funds for working capital purposes is limited 
we have historically depended on operating cash flow and availability under our credit facility to provide short term liquidity 
during the year ended february   we terminated our credit facility with bank of america and entered into new credit facility agreements with first capital the agreements 
the agreements primarily consists of a factoring arrangement for all of the company s accounts receivable and includes a smaller credit line component using the company s inventory as collateral 
while the agreements do not contain explicit financial covenants  the agreement provides first capital with significant latitude in restricting  reducing  or withdrawing our lines of credit at its sole discretion 
if first capital restricts  reduces or eliminates the company s access to credit  or requires immediate repayment of the amounts outstanding under the agreement  we will be required to pursue additional or alternative sources of liquidity such as equity financings or a new debt agreement with other creditors  both of which may contain less favorable terms 
we can not assure that such additional sources of capital will be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
our inability to maintain a sufficient credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our business may be negatively impacted as a result of changes in the economy 
the united states and global economies have been in a state of recession 
our business depends on the general economic environment and levels of consumer spending that affect not only the end consumer  but also retailers who are our direct customers 
purchases of consumer optics decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects  when consumer spending  particularly on discretionary items  declines 
during periods of recession or economic uncertainty  we may not be able to maintain our sales to existing customers  make sales to new customers  or improve our operating results as a percentage of net sales 
as a result  our operating results may be materially adversely affected by downward trends in the economy or the occurrence of events that adversely affect the economy in general 
we depend on our key personnel and may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees 
our future success will depend to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  marketing  technical  financial  accounting and operational personnel  including steven g 
murdock  our chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we also believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled managerial and technical resources 
competition for such personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
in addition  recent layoffs and potential future facility shutdowns and workforce reductions could have a negative impact on employee recruiting and retention 
we rely on independent contract manufacturers and  as a result  we are exposed to potential disruptions in product supply 
all of our consumer optics products with retail prices under are currently manufactured by independent contract manufacturers  principally located in china 
we do not have long term contracts with our asian manufacturers  and we compete with other consumer optics companies for production facilities 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  difficulties with these manufacturers  including reductions in the availability of production capacity  failure to meet our quality control standards  failure to meet production deadlines and increased manufacturing costs 
some manufacturers in china have faced labor shortages and wage inflation as migrant workers seek better wages and working conditions 
in addition  the increase in certain commodity prices has increased production costs for our manufacturers 
if these trends continue  our current manufacturers operations could be adversely affected 
if any of our current manufacturers cease doing business with us  we could experience an interruption in the manufacture of our products 
although we believe that we could find alternative manufacturers  we may be unable to establish relationships with alternative manufacturers that will be as favorable as the relationships we have now 
for example  new manufacturers may have higher prices  less favorable payment terms  lower manufacturing capacity  lower quality standards or higher lead times for delivery 
if we are unable to provide products to our customers that are consistent with our standards or the manufacture of our products is delayed or becomes more expensive  this could result in our customers canceling orders  refusing to accept deliveries or demanding reductions in purchase prices  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our future success depends upon our ability to respond to changing consumer demands and successfully develop and market new products 
the consumer optics industry is subject to changing consumer demands and technology trends 
accordingly  we must identify those trends and respond in a timely manner 
demand for and market acceptance of new products are uncertain  and achieving market acceptance for new products generally requires substantial product development and marketing efforts and expenditures 
due to our reductions in headcount and our reduced resources  we may not be able to invest as much in product development and marketing 
if we do not continue to meet changing consumer demands and develop successful products in the future  our growth and profitability will be negatively impacted 
we frequently make decisions about product designs and marketing expenditures several months to years in advance of the time when consumer acceptance can be determined 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in trends or we are not successful in marketing new products  we could experience excess inventories  higher than normal markdowns or an inability to profitably sell our products 
because of these risks  the consumer optics industry has experienced periods of growth in revenues and earnings and thereafter periods of declining sales and losses 
similarly  these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 

table of contents our business and the success of our products could be harmed if we are unable to maintain our brand image 
our principal brands include meade and coronado 
if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand  our brand names and brand images may be impaired 
even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences  consumers may consider these brands to be outdated or undesirable 
if we fail to maintain and develop our principal brands  our sales and profitability will be adversely affected 
we depend upon a relatively small group of customers for a large portion of our sales 
during fiscal and  net sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately and  of total net sales  respectively 
during the fiscal year and our top two customers accounted for approximately and of net sales  respectively 
although we have long term relationships with many of our customers  those customers do not have contractual obligations to purchase our products and we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our existing major customers 
furthermore  the retail industry regularly experiences consolidation  contractions and closings which may result in a loss of customers or the loss of our ability to collect accounts receivable from major customers in excess of amounts that we have insured 
if we lose a major customer  experience a significant decrease in sales to a major customer or are unable to collect the accounts receivable of a major customer in excess of amounts insured  our business could be significantly harmed 
our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain appropriate inventory levels 
we place orders with suppliers for many of our products prior to the time we receive all of our customers orders 
we do this to minimize purchasing costs  the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non delivery 
we  at times  also maintain an inventory of certain products that we anticipate will be in greater demand 
however  we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory 
inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write downs  and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
conversely  if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our suppliers fail to supply the products that we require with the quality and at the time we need them  we may experience inventory shortages 
inventory shortages might delay shipments to our customers  negatively impact our retailer and distributor relationships  reduce future orders from customers and diminish brand loyalty 
the disruption  expense and potential liability associated with any litigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and threatened legal proceedings from time to time 
any litigation in the future  regardless of its merits  could significantly divert management s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees being borne by us 
further  there can be no assurance that any actions that have been or will be brought against us will be resolved in our favor or  if significant monetary judgments are rendered against us  that we will have the ability to pay such judgments 
such disruptions  legal fees and any losses resulting from these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we have divested significant portions of our business and are now a less diversified enterprise focused primarily on telescopes 
the lack of a diversified business makes us more exposed to volatility in the telescope market  which is highly discretionary in nature and has been contracting 
during fiscal  we divested our simmons  weaver and redfield sports optics business as well as our european operations 
each of these businesses had contributed profit to the company and diversified our sources of revenue and income 
as a result  our business is now more dependent on the sale of telescopes  the market for which is highly discretionary and competitive in nature and has been contracting 
if the telescope market continues to deteriorate  it could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
in addition  the sale of the divested businesses also generated significant amounts of cash for the company 
the company has few remaining divestiture options should the need arise to raise additional cash  further limiting the company s ability to raise additional cash should the need arise 

table of contents we face intense competition  including competition from companies with significantly greater resources  and  if we are unable to compete effectively with these competitors  our market share may decline and our business could be harmed 
we face intense competition from other established companies 
a number of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technological  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution resources than we do 
their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the consumer optics market  compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products 
in addition  new companies may enter the markets in which we compete  further increasing competition in the consumer optics industry 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including the type and quality of our products and the strength of our brand names  as well as many factors beyond our control 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future  and increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profit margins  loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand the development and marketing of new products  any of which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be unable to successfully execute our growth and profitability strategies 
our net sales and operating results have fluctuated significantly over the past five fiscal years and we may experience similar fluctuations in the future 
our ability to grow in the future depends upon  among other things  our ability to return to profitability  the maintenance and enhancement of our brand image and expansion of our product offerings and distribution channels 
furthermore  if our business becomes larger  we may not be able to effectively manage our growth 
we anticipate that as the business grows  we will have to improve and enhance our overall financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures 
we may be unable to successfully implement our current growth and profitability strategies or other growth strategies or effectively manage our growth  any of which would negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our international sales and manufacturing operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad  particularly in china and mexico  which could affect our ability to sell or manufacture our products in international markets  obtain products from foreign suppliers or control product costs 
nearly all of our products are now manufactured in foreign countries primarily mexico and china 
we also sell our products in several foreign countries and plan to increase our international sales efforts as part of our growth strategy 
foreign manufacturing and sales are subject to a number of risks  including the following political and social unrest  changing economic conditions  currency exchange rate fluctuations  international political tension and terrorism  labor shortages and work stoppages  electrical shortages  transportation delays  loss or damage to products in transit  expropriation  nationalization  the imposition of domestic and international tariffs and trade duties  import and export controls and other non tariff barriers  exposure to different legal standards particularly with respect to intellectual property  compliance with foreign laws  and changes in domestic and foreign governmental policies 
in addition  there has been increased violence in mexico due to the mexican government s attempts to stop the illegal drug trade 
we have not  to date  been materially affected by any such risks  but we cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring or the resulting long term adverse impact on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in particular  because our products are manufactured in china and mexico  adverse changes in trade or political relations with these countries  political instability  the occurrence of a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane or the outbreak of pandemic diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars  the avian flu or the swine flu could severely interfere with the manufacture of our products in these countries and would have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  electrical shortages  labor shortages or work stoppages may extend the production time necessary to produce our orders  and there may be circumstances in the future where we may have to incur premium freight charges to expedite the delivery of product to our customers 
if we incur a significant amount of premium charges to airfreight product for our customers  gross profit will be negatively affected if we are unable to pass those charges on to our customers 

table of contents also  the manufacturers of our products that are located in china may be subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations should the chinese currency not remain stable with the us dollar 
the value of the yuan  the chinese currency depends to a large extent on the chinese government s policies and china s domestic and international economic and political developments 
the valuation of the yuan may increase decrease incrementally over time should the chinese central bank allow it to do so  which could significantly increase decrease labor and other costs incurred in the production of our products in china 
our business could be harmed if our contract manufacturers or suppliers violate labor  trade or other laws 
we require our independent contract manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable united states and foreign laws and regulations 
manufacturers may not use convicted  forced or indentured labor as defined under united states law nor child labor as defined by the manufacturer s country in the production process 
compensation must be paid in accordance with local law  and factories must be in compliance with local safety regulations 
although we promote ethical business practices and send sourcing personnel periodically to visit and monitor the operations of our independent contract manufacturers  we do not control them or their labor practices 
if one of our independent contract manufacturers violates labor or other laws or diverges from those labor practices generally accepted as ethical in the united states  it could result in the loss of certain of our major customers  adverse publicity for us  damage our reputation in the united states or render our conduct of business in a particular foreign country undesirable or impractical  any of which could harm our business 
in addition  if we  or our foreign manufacturers  violate united states or foreign trade laws or regulations  we may be subject to extra duties  significant monetary penalties  the seizure and the forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import or the loss of our import privileges 
possible violations of united states or foreign laws or regulations could include inadequate record keeping of imported products  misstatements or errors as to the origin  quota category  classification  marketing or valuation of our imported products  fraudulent visas or labor violations 
the effects of these factors could render our conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical and have a negative impact on our operating results 
our quarterly revenues and operating results fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including seasonal fluctuations in the demand for consumer optics  delivery date delays and potential fluctuations in our annualized tax rate  which may result in volatility of our stock price 
our quarterly revenues and net operating results have varied significantly in the past and can be expected to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our major customers generally have no obligation to purchase forecasted amounts and may cancel orders  change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice and without penalty 
as a result  we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales or net operating results 
in addition  sales of consumer optics have historically been seasonal in nature and tied to the winter holiday shopping season  with the strongest sales generally occurring in our third fiscal quarter 
holiday shopping sales typically begin to ship in august  and delays in the timing  cancellation  or rescheduling of the related orders by our wholesale customers could negatively impact our net sales and results of operations 
more specifically  the timing of when products are shipped is determined by the delivery schedules set by our wholesale customers  which could cause sales to shift between our second  third and fourth quarters 
because our expense levels are partially based on our expectations of future net sales  expenses may be disproportionately large relative to our revenues  and we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shifts or shortfalls  which could have a material adverse effect on our net operating results 
also  our annualized tax rate is based upon projections of our operating results for the year  which are reviewed and revised by management as necessary at the end of each quarter  and it is highly sensitive to fluctuations in the projected mix of earnings 
any quarterly fluctuations in our annualized tax rate that may occur could have a material impact on our quarterly net operating results 
as a result of these specific and other general factors  our net operating results vary from quarter to quarter and the results for any particular quarter may not be necessarily indicative of results for the full year which may lead to volatility in our stock price 

table of contents changes in currency exchange rates could affect our revenues and operating results 
a significant portion of our production is accomplished offshore  principally in china 
accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the currencies of europe and asia could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
additionally  such fluctuations could result in an increase in cost of products sold in foreign markets  reducing margins and earnings 
we may not be able to raise additional funds when needed for our business or to exploit opportunities 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including our success in recognizing and exploiting opportunities for expansion through potential future acquisitions 
we may need to raise additional funds to support expansion  develop new technologies  respond to competitive pressures  or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
if required  we may raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and such financing  if obtained  would be dilutive to our stockholders 
our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if we are sued for intellectual property infringement 
we use trademarks on virtually all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our products  in identifying the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others 
we consider our meade and coronado trademarks and brand names to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in many countries 
in addition  we own many other trademarks and trade names  which we utilize in marketing our products 
we continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement 
we also have a number of utility patents and design patents covering components and features used in many of our telescopes  binoculars and other products 
we believe our success depends more upon skills in design  research and development  production and marketing rather than upon our patent position 
however  we have followed a policy of filing applications for united states and foreign patents on designs and technologies that we deem valuable as critical contributors to our business 
our trademarks  design patents  utility patents and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the united states 
we believe that our trademarks  design patents  utility patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business and our competitive position 
we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks  design patents and utility patents on a worldwide basis 
nevertheless  we cannot assure that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights outside the united states will be adequate to prevent infringement of our technologies or trade names by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and proprietary rights of others 
also  we cannot assure that others will not assert rights in  or ownership of  our trademarks  patents  designs and other proprietary rights or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the united states  and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others  our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 
we are exposed to potential risks from legislation requiring public companies to evaluate controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act of we are subject to various regulatory requirements  including the sarbanes oxley act of we  like all other public companies  are incurring expenses and diverting management s time in an effort to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of section 
we are required to assess our compliance with section and we believe we have devoted the necessary resources  including additional internal and supplemental external resources  to support our assessment 
however  if in the future  we identify one or more material weaknesses  or our external auditors are unable to attest that our management s report is fairly stated or to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  this could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports  have an adverse effect on our stock price and or subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities 

table of contents our charter and bylaws  as well as applicable corporate laws  could limit the ability of others to take over management control of the company 
we will have the ability to issue preferred stock  which could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent  and limitations on calling stockholder meetings 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
these provisions could have the effect of discouraging certain attempts to acquire the company  which could deprive our stockholders of the opportunity to sell their shares of common stock at prices higher than prevailing market prices 
in addition  our board of directors has authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could affect adversely the voting power of holders of our common stock and the likelihood that such holders will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation 
additionally  the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of the common stock and may affect adversely the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock

overview of the company and recent developments meade instruments corp 
is engaged in the design  manufacture  marketing and sale of consumer optics products  primarily telescopes  telescope accessories and binoculars 
we design our products in house or with the assistance of external consultants 
most of our products are manufactured overseas by contract manufacturers in asia  while our high end telescopes are manufactured and assembled in our mexico facilities 
sales of our products are driven by an in house sales force as well as a network of sales representatives throughout the us we currently operate out of two primary locations irvine  california and tijuana  mexico 
our california facility serves as the company s corporate headquarters and us distribution  our mexico facilities contain our manufacturing  assembly  repair  packaging  research and development  and other general and administrative operations 
our business is highly seasonal and our financial results have historically varied significantly on a quarter by quarter basis throughout each year 

table of contents we believe that the company holds valuable brand names and intellectual property that provides us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
the meade brand name is ubiquitous in the consumer telescope market  while the coronado brand name represents a unique niche in the area of solar astronomy 
during fiscal we sold our simmons  weaver and redfield sports optics brands for gross proceeds of million 
in january  we sold our meade europe subsidiary for gross proceeds of million 
the proceeds from these divestitures were used to repay the company s credit facility balance and to fund the restructuring of the company s cost structure  including funding operating losses 
the sale of the company s former sport optics brands and associated assets did not qualify as a discontinued operation as defined by asc no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc no 
because the operations and cash flows could not be clearly distinguished from the rest of the entity 
these brands and inventory were fully integrated into the structure of a much larger business 
meade europe is presented in the consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation as defined by asc no 
as a discontinued operation  revenues  expenses and cash flows of meade europe have been excluded from the respective captions in the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to assist users in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy complies with asc no 
 revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  typically at the time of shipment  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue is not recognized at the time of shipment if these criteria are not met 
under certain circumstances  the company accepts product returns or offers markdown incentives 
material management judgments must be made and used in connection with establishing sales returns and allowances estimates 
the company continuously monitors and tracks returns and allowances and records revenues net of provisions for returns and allowances 
the company s estimate of sales returns and allowances is based upon several factors including historical experience  current market and economic conditions  customer demand and acceptance of the company s products and or any notification received by the company of such a return 
historically  sales returns and allowances have been within management s estimates  however  actual returns may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from management s estimates depending on actual market conditions at the time of the return 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
the company evaluates the carrying value of its inventories taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand and the price the company expects to obtain for its products in their respective markets 
the company also evaluates the composition of its inventories to identify any slow moving or obsolete product 
these evaluations require material management judgments  including estimates of future sales  continuing market acceptance of the company s products  and current market and economic conditions 
inventory may be written down based on such judgments for any inventories that are identified as having a net realizable value less than its cost 
however  if the company is not able to meet its sales expectations  or if market conditions deteriorate significantly from management s estimates  reductions in the net realizable value of the company s inventories could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
acquisition related intangible assets the company accounts for acquisition related intangible assets in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 
 business combinations  and asc no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
a portion of the remaining difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net tangible assets at the date of acquisition is included in the balance sheet as acquisition related intangible assets 
amortization periods for the intangible assets subject to amortization range from seven to fifteen years depending on the nature of the assets acquired 
the carrying value of acquisition related intangible assets  including the related amortization period  is evaluated in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  which is determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows based upon our estimated cost of capital  an impairment loss is reflected in loss from operations 
such estimates are subject to change and we may be required to recognize an impairment loss in the future 
income taxes a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
significant judgment is necessary in the determination of the recoverability of the company s deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets are reviewed regularly for recoverability  and the company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company assesses the recoverability of the deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
in making this assessment  the company is required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the net deferred assets will be realized in future periods 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized  the value of that asset will be reduced to its expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
if it is determined that a deferred tax asset that had previously been written down will be realized in the future  the value of that deferred tax asset will be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when the determination is made 
actual results may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from the evidence used to assess the recoverability of the company s deferred tax assets 
on march   the company adopted the provisions of fasb accounting standards codification no 
asc asc no 
related to accounting for uncertain tax positions 
as a result of the implementation of asc no 
 the company recognized no material increase in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
at february   unrecognized tax benefits  all of which affect the effective tax rate if recognized  were million 
management does not anticipate that there will be a material change in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits within the next months 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
as of february   accrued interest related to uncertain tax benefit was less than million 
the tax years remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the company is subject 

table of contents results of operations the nature of the company s business is highly seasonal 
historically  sales in the third quarter ended november th each year have been higher than sales achieved in each of the other three fiscal quarters of the year 
thus  expenses and  to a greater extent  results from operations income may significantly vary by quarter 
therefore  caution is advised when appraising results for a period shorter than a full year  or when comparing any period other than to the same period of the previous year 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the company s statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal years ended february  february  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling general and administrative research and development esop contribution expense gain on brand sales restructuring costs impairment of acquisition related intangible assets and goodwill loss from operations interest income expense  net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax net loss the following table summarizes our net sales by product category fiscal years ended february  february  telescopes related products riflescopes binoculars other net sales fiscal compared to fiscal the company reported net sales of million in fiscal year  a decrease of million or from net sales of million fiscal this decrease was due to a decrease of approximately million in net sales due to the company s sale of its former sport optics brands last year  and the resulting elimination of the revenue associated with those products 
a decrease in sales of most of the company s high end telescopes  accessories products and low end telescopes were mostly offset by an increase in sales of the company s mid range telescopes 
in spite of increased expenses related to the transitioning of manufacturing to the mexico facility  and clearing last year s backlog due to capacity issues  the decrease in the sales of the company s high end telescopes was primarily attributable to weaker demand 
the increase in sales of the company s mid range telescopes was due to new product development 
reduced distribution outlets  increased competition and overall weak demand were also factors contributing to the decline in sales 
management believes that  as the company introduces new products into the telescope market  demand for some of the company s products may be stimulated 
however  there can be no assurances that demand will be increased for the company s products 
management also believes that demand for the company s less expensive telescope and binocular products can be enhanced with new product introductions  targeted marketing and competitive pricing 
the company generated approximately and of its revenue from top two customers during the year ended february  and february  
table of contents the following table summarizes the more significant fluctuations in net sales amounts in millions from fiscal to fiscal telescopes related products riflescopes binoculars other total net sales fiscal reduction in sales to costco and walmart divestiture of sport optics brands other factors net sales fiscal the gross profit margin during fiscal increased to of net sales  compared with of net sales in fiscal this improvement in the gross profit margin was driven by a favorable change in product mix  reductions in the company s manufacturing expenses and higher average selling price and non recurring events of fiscal inventory and sku reduction initiatives resulting in inventory write downs and higher markdowns 
approximately of the improvement in the gross profit margin was due to the devaluation of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar 
most of the company s employees at its manufacturing facility in mexico  as well as certain other manufacturing costs  are paid in mexican pesos 
in addition  the company consolidated its operations in mexico to one building in june  reducing the company s monthly rent by half approximately thousand per month or thousand per quarter 
the company s operating efficiency at its manufacturing facility in mexico has also improved  reducing the company s manufacturing costs 
selling expenses decreased from million of net sales in fiscal to million of net sales in fiscal while the lower sales volume was the primary contributor to lower selling expenses such as freight out and commissions  the decrease was also driven by lower headcount and reduced discretionary spending 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  a decrease of million or compared to million in fiscal out of the million reduction  million was due to excess facility costs rent  facility moving costs and utilities associated with our former irvine  california corporate headquarters 
the remainder of the decrease in general and administrative expenses was mostly due to reductions in both headcount and professional services 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year were million  a decrease of million or compared to million in fiscal primarily due to completion of the company s new product introduction etx ls at the end of the quarter ending may  in august  the company terminated its esop and distributed the remaining shares to eligible employees  which resulted in the elimination of this expense 
in april and june  the company sold its simmons  weaver and redfield sport optics brands and associated inventory for gross proceeds of million 
this sale resulted in a gain of approximately million 
excluding this gain  the company would have reported a net loss of million  or per share 
restructuring costs of million in fiscal consisted of a million lease termination fee related to the company s former irvine  california facility and million in severance related costs due to headcount reductions 
the company paid million of the lease termination fee in february and the remaining million was paid in full during the fiscal year ended february  
table of contents the company earned interest income in fiscal  due to the net cash received from the sale of meade europe in january interest expense of thousand was incurred in the prior year due to the company s borrowings on its former credit facility 
due to the cash generated from the sale of simmons  weaver and redfield brands  the company reduced its usage of credit facilities during fiscal the company did not record any income tax provision or benefit during fiscal due to its loss from operations  level of net operating loss carry forwards and valuation allowances recorded against the related deferred tax assets due to the company s recurring historical losses 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million for the fiscal  relating almost exclusively to the write off of a deferred tax liability associated with intangible assets sold as part of the brand sales 
as noted above  the company sold meade europe in january as a result  the results of meade europe have been classified as a discontinued operation 
income from discontinued operations  net of tax  was million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources at february   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million  as compared to million at february   a decrease of million due to company s loss from operations  offset partially by improvements in working capital management 
net cash used in operating activities decreased from million during the fiscal year ended february  compared to million during the fiscal year ended february  a decrease of million or due primarily to the decrease in operating loss excluding gain on brand sales 
operating loss excluding gain on brand sales decreased from million during the fiscal year ended february  to million during the fiscal year ended february  a decrease of million or  due to an improved gross margin and lower operating expenses 
in addition  approximately million or of the million of cash used in operating activities during fiscal consisted of restructuring costs associated with officer severance and the lease termination fee associated with the relocation of the company s corporate headquarters in february the following table illustrates certain of the key liquidity and capital structure ratios that management uses in evaluating the company s liquidity and capital structure february  february  february  february  in thousands current ratio current assets current liabilities current ratio quick ratio current assets inventories  net quick assets current liabilities quick ratio 
table of contents the company currently has in place an undrawn million secured credit facility with first capital 
availability of funds under this facility is based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
availability on this facility amounted to approximately million as of february  while the company s credit facility does not contain explicit financial covenants  the company s lender has significant latitude in restricting  reducing or withdrawing the company s credit facility at its sole discretion with limited notice  as is customary with these types of arrangements 
in the event the company requires more capital than is presently anticipated due to unforeseen factors  the company may need to rely on its credit facility 
in such an instance  if its lender restricts  reduces or eliminates the company s access to credit  or requires immediate repayment of the amounts outstanding under the agreement  the company would be required to pursue additional or alternative sources of liquidity such as equity financings or a new debt agreement with other creditors  either of which may contain less favorable terms 
the company cannot assure that such additional sources of capital would be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
the company currently anticipates that cash on hand and funds generated from operations  including cost saving measures the company has taken and additional measures it could still take  will be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated cash requirements for fiscal capital expenditures  including financed purchases of equipment  aggregated million and million for the years ended february  and  respectively 
the company had no material capital expenditure commitments at february  inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the past two years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in fiscal and beyond
