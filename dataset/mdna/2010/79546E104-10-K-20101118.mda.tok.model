sally beauty supply stores target retail consumers and salon professionals  while bsg exclusively targets salons and salon professionals 
for the year ended september   our consolidated net sales and operating earnings were  million and million  respectively 
we believe sally beauty supply is the largest open line distributor of professional beauty supplies in the us based on store count

store formats  including average size and product selection  for sally beauty supply outside the us and canada vary by marketplace 
we believe bsg is the largest full service distributor of professional beauty supplies in the us as of september   bsg had company operated stores  supplied franchised stores and had a sales force of approximately  professional distributor sales consultants selling exclusively to salons and salon professionals in substantially all states in the us and in portions of canada  puerto rico  mexico and certain european countries

industry and business trends we operate within the large and growing us professional beauty supply industry 
potential growth in the industry is expected to be driven by increases in consumer demand for hair color  hair loss prevention and 
table of contents hair styling products 
we believe the following key industry and business trends and characteristics will influence our business and our financial results going forward high level of marketplace fragmentation 
the us salon channel is highly fragmented with over  hair salons 
given the fragmented and small scale nature of the salon industry  we believe that salon operators will continue to depend on full service exclusive distributors and open line channels for a majority of their beauty supply purchases 
growth in booth renting and frequent stocking needs 
salon professionals primarily rely on just in time inventory due to capital constraints and a lack of warehouse and shelf space at salons 
in addition  booth renters  who comprise a significant percentage of total us salon professionals  are often responsible for purchasing their own supplies 
historically  booth renters have significantly increased as a percentage of total salon professionals  and we expect this trend to continue 
given their smaller individual purchases and relative lack of financial resources  booth renters are likely to be dependent on frequent trips to professional beauty supply stores  like bsg and sally beauty supply 
we expect that these factors will continue to drive demand for conveniently located professional beauty supply stores 
increasing use of exclusive label products 
we offer a broad range of exclusive label products 
as our lines of exclusive label products have matured and become better known in our retail stores  we have seen an increase in sales of these products 
generally  our exclusive label products have higher gross margins than the leading third party branded products and  accordingly  the growth in sales of these products will likely enhance our overall gross margins 
please see risk factors we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
favorable demographic and consumer trends 
we expect the aging baby boomer population to drive future growth in professional beauty supply sales through an increase in the usage of hair color and hair loss products 
additionally  continuously changing fashion related trends that drive new hair styles are expected to result in continued demand for hair styling products 
changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends can have an impact on our financial performance 
our continued success depends in large part on our ability to anticipate  gauge and react in a timely and effective manner to changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences for beauty products 
we continuously adapt our marketing and merchandising initiatives for sally beauty supply in an effort to expand our market reach or to respond to changing consumer preferences 
if we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the marketplace for beauty products and changing consumer demands  our business could suffer 
international growth strategies 
a key element of our growth strategy depends on our ability to capitalize on growth in the international marketplace and to grow our current level of non us operations 
for example  on december   we acquired sinelco  a wholesale distributor of professional beauty products located in belgium with sales throughout europe 
in addition  on september   we acquired intersalon  a leading distributor of premier beauty supply products with stores located in chile 
these acquisitions furthered our expansion plans in europe and latin america  key targets of sally beauty supply s international growth initiative 
we intend to continue to identify and evaluate non us acquisition and or organic growth targets 
our ability to grow our non us operations  integrate our new non us acquisitions and successfully pursue additional non us acquisition and or organic growth targets may be affected by business  legal  regulatory and economic risks 
please see risk factors we may not be able to successfully identify acquisition candidates and complete desirable acquisitions  if we acquire any businesses in the future  they could prove difficult to integrate  disrupt our business or have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to conduct business in international marketplaces may be affected by legal  regulatory and economic risks 

table of contents continuing consolidation 
there is continuing consolidation among professional beauty product distributors and professional beauty product manufacturers 
we plan to continue to examine ways in which we can benefit from this trend  including reviewing opportunities to shift business within the professional beauty products channel from competitive distributors to the bsg network as well as seeking opportunistic  value added acquisitions which complement our long term growth strategy 
we believe that suppliers are increasingly likely to focus on larger distributors and retailers with a broader scale and retail footprint 
we also believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend as well as participate in the ongoing consolidation at the distributor retail level 
however  changes often occur in our relationships with suppliers that may materially affect the net sales and operating earnings of our business segments 
consolidation among suppliers could exacerbate the effects of these relationship changes and could increase pricing pressures 
for example  as we announced in december  our largest supplier  l oreal  moved a material amount of revenue out of the bsg nationwide distribution network and into competitive regional distribution networks 
more recently  l oreal acquired distributors competing with bsg in the southeastern and west coast of the us and  as a result  directly competes with bsg in certain geographic areas 
if l oreal acquired other distributors or suppliers that conduct significant business with bsg  we could lose related revenue 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further loss of revenue over time by bsg including within its franchise based business due to potential losses of additional products both from l oreal and from other suppliers as well as from the increased competition from l oreal affiliated distribution networks 
please see risk factors the beauty products distribution industry is highly competitive and is consolidating and we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
relationships with suppliers 
sally beauty supply bsg and their suppliers are dependent on each other for the distribution of beauty products 
we do not manufacture the brand name or exclusive label products we sell 
we purchase our products from a limited number of manufacturers 
as is typical in distribution businesses  these relationships are subject to change from time to time including the expansion or loss of distribution rights in various geographies and the addition or loss of product lines 
since we purchase products from many manufacturers on an at will basis  under contracts which can generally be terminated without cause upon days notice or less or which expire without express rights of renewal  such manufacturers could discontinue sales to us at any time or upon the expiration of the distribution period 
some of our contracts with manufacturers may be terminated by such manufacturers if we fail to meet specified minimum purchase requirements 
in such cases  we do not have contractual assurances of continued supply  pricing or access to new products and vendors may change the terms upon which they sell 
infrequently  a supplier will seek to terminate a distribution relationship through legal action 
for example  in farouk systems  inc filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment that it was entitled to terminate a long term distribution agreement with armstrong mccall 
in that matter was settled and bsg now sells farouk products in some territories 
changes in our relationships with suppliers occur often and could positively or negatively impact our net sales and operating profits 
although we focus on developing new revenue and cost management initiatives to mitigate the negative effects resulting from unfavorable changes in our supplier relationships  there can be no assurance that our efforts will continue to completely offset the loss of these or other distribution rights 
please see risk factors we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
we expect to continue to expand our product line offerings and to gain additional distribution rights over time through either further negotiation with suppliers or by strategic acquisitions of existing distributors 
although we are focused on developing new revenue and cost management initiatives  there can be no assurance that our efforts will partially or completely offset any potential loss of distribution rights in the future 
please see risk factors we depend upon manufacturers who may 
table of contents be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
high level of competition 
sally beauty supply competes with other domestic and international beauty product wholesale and retail outlets  including local and regional open line beauty supply stores  professional only beauty supply stores  salons  mass merchandisers  drug stores and supermarkets  as well as sellers on the internet and salons retailing hair care items 
bsg competes with other domestic and international beauty product wholesale and retail suppliers and manufacturers selling professional beauty products directly to salons and individual salon professionals 
we also face competition from authorized and unauthorized retailers and internet sites offering professional salon only products 
the increasing availability of unauthorized professional salon products in large format retail stores such as drug stores  grocery stores and others could also have a negative impact on our business 
please see risk factors the beauty products distribution industry is highly competitive and is consolidating 
economic conditions 
we appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer a broad selection of beauty products sold directly to retail consumers and salons and salon professionals 
historically  these factors have provided us with reduced exposure to downturns in economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
however  a downturn in the economy  especially for an extended period of time  could adversely impact consumer demand of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services  particularly affecting our electrical products category and our full service sales business 
in addition  higher freight costs resulting from increases in the cost of fuel  especially for an extended period of time  may impact our expenses at levels that we cannot pass through to our customers 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
please see risk factors the health of the economy in the channels we serve may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
controlling expenses 
another important aspect of our business is our ability to control costs  especially in our bsg business segment  by right sizing the business and maximizing the efficiency of our structure 
in we completed implementation of an approximately million capital spending program to consolidate warehouses and reduce administrative expenses related to bsg s distribution network resulting in annualized cost savings of approximately million for the fiscal year 
please see risk factors we are not certain that our ongoing cost control plans will continue to be successful 
opening new stores 
our future growth strategy depends in part on our ability to open and profitably operate new stores in existing and additional geographic areas 
the capital requirements to open a us based sally beauty supply or bsg store  excluding inventory  average approximately  and  respectively  with the capital requirements for international stores costing less or substantially more depending upon the marketplace 
we may not be able to open all of the new stores we plan to open and any new stores we open may not be profitable  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
please see risk factors if we are unable to profitably open and operate new stores  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
changes to our information technology systems 
as our operations grow in both size and scope  we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our information systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure 
the expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial  operational and technical resources in advance of any increase in the volume of our business  with no assurance that the volume of business will increase 
for example  we have recently upgraded our financial reporting 
table of contents systems in the us and are in the process of designing and implementing a standardized erp system internationally over the next few years 
in addition  we are currently implementing a three year point of sale system upgrade program in a number of our divisions including our sally beauty supply operations in the us  which we anticipate will provide significant benefits  including enhanced tracking of customer sales and store inventory activity 
these and any other required upgrades to our information systems and information technology or new technology  now or in the future  will require that our management and resources be diverted from our core business to assist in completion of these projects 
there can be no assurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades  service outages or delays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology and customer issues therewith  or the impact on the reliability of our data from any new or upgraded technology will not have a material adverse effect on our financial reporting  business  financial condition or results of operations 
please see risk factors we may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems 
significant recent acquisitions on december   we acquired sinelco  a wholesale distributor of professional beauty products based in ronse  belgium  for approximately million approximately million 
we also assumed million approximately million of pre acquisition debt  excluding capital lease obligations  of sinelco in connection with the acquisition 
sinelco serves over  customers through a product catalog and website and has sales throughout europe 
goodwill of million which is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes was recorded as a result of this acquisition 
in addition  during the fiscal year  we completed several other individually immaterial acquisitions at an aggregate cost of million and recorded additional goodwill in the amount of million the majority of which is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes in connection with such acquisitions 
the valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the all acquisitions completed during the fiscal year was based on their fair values at the acquisition date 
we funded these acquisitions with cash from operations as well as borrowings under our abl facility
