item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in part ii  item of this report 
overview of our business shoe carnival  inc is one of the nation s largest family footwear retailers 
as of january   we operated stores in states primarily in the midwest  south and southeast regions of the united states 
we offer a distinctive shopping experience  a broad merchandise assortment and value to our customers while maintaining an efficient store level cost structure 
our stores combine competitive pricing with a highly promotional  in store marketing effort that encourages customer participation and creates a fun and exciting shopping experience 
we believe this highly promotional atmosphere results in various competitive advantages  including increased multiple unit sales  the building of a loyal  repeat customer base  the creation of word of mouth advertising  and enhanced sell through of in season goods 
our objective is to be the destination store of choice for a wide range of consumers seeking moderately priced  current season name brand and private label footwear 
our product assortment includes dress and casual shoes  sandals  boots and a wide assortment of athletic shoes for the entire family 
we believe that by offering a wide selection of both athletic and non athletic footwear  we are able to reduce our exposure to shifts in fashion preferences between those categories 
our marketing effort targets moderate income  value conscious consumers seeking name brand footwear for all age groups 
we believe that by offering a wide selection of popular styles of name brand merchandise at competitive prices  we generate broad customer appeal 
our cost efficient store operations and real estate strategy enable us to price products competitively 
low labor costs are achieved by housing merchandise directly on the selling floor in an open stock format  enabling customers to serve themselves  if they choose 
this reduces the staffing required to assist customers and reduces store level labor costs as a percentage of sales 
we locate stores predominantly in strip shopping centers in order to take advantage of lower occupancy costs and maximize our exposure to value oriented shoppers 
our fiscal year is a week year ending on the saturday closest to january unless otherwise stated  references to years  and relate respectively to the fiscal years ended january   january  and february  executive summary fiscal during fiscal  we achieved earnings per diluted share of  a increase over the earned in fiscal this increase resulted from a combination of top line sales growth  strong gross profit improvement and our ability to maintain tight control over operating expenses 
in addition net sales increased million to million  a increase over the prior year 
during the first six months of fiscal  our comparable store sales declined 
however  customer traffic began to increase significantly in august the beginning of the back to school selling season  and we saw sustained increases through the remainder of the year  which drove a comparable store sales gain for the six month period 
for the full year  our comparable store sales increased 
this sales gain was largely driven by an increase in the average selling price of our footwear 
we were able to raise our average price through an increase in the sale of higher priced footwear  such as boots and athletics  and by operating in a less promotional selling environment during the second half of fiscal compared to the prior year period 
our gross profit margin increased to from in fiscal well controlled inventories and strong fashion trends resulted in a merchandise margin increase of 
buying  distribution and occupancy costs decreased  as a percentage of sales  due to the leveraging effect of higher sales and a  decrease in expenses 
our expense savings were primarily related to cost reduction initiatives within our supply chain  which resulted in a reduction in distribution logistics expense 
selling  general and administrative expenditures were well controlled  increasing only million  or  during fiscal these costs decreased as a percentage of sales year over year 
we opened stores and closed nine stores during fiscal  ending the year with stores 
by slowing our store growth and tightly controlling all other capital expenditures  our total capital expenditures decreased million  as compared to the prior year 
we generated million of cash from operating activities net of purchases of property and equipment and ended the fiscal year with million in cash and cash equivalents and no interest bearing debt 
fiscal in fiscal  we expect the positive sales trend we saw in the second half of fiscal to continue  particularly in the first half of the year where the sales comparisons are easier 
however  we will continue to be cautious with our inventories  selling  general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures 
in addition our per store inventories are expected to increase in the mid single digit percentage range in the first half of fiscal and low single digits in the second half of the year as compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to rise moderately  primarily due to increases in employee compensation  including incentive compensation tied to financial performance  and advertising 
capital expenditures are expected to increase to million primarily due to our decision to return to a more normalized plan of remodeling our stores 
we completed a minimal amount of remodeling during fiscal we anticipate opening to stores and closing to stores 
we will accelerate our store growth when we see a sustained improvement in consumer spending and commercial real estate development 
by controlling the growth in our expense structure  inventories and capital expenditures in fiscal  we anticipate having positive free cash flow for the year 
this would be our seventh consecutive year of positive free cash flow 
critical accounting policies it is necessary for us to include certain judgments in our reported financial results 
these judgments involve estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the accounting policies that require the more significant judgments are merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
in determining market value  we estimate the future sales price of items of merchandise contained in the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
factors considered in this determination include  among others  current and recently recorded sales prices  the length of time product has been held in inventory and quantities of various product styles contained in inventory 
the ultimate amount realized from the sale of certain product could differ materially from our estimates 
we also estimate a shrinkage reserve for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and annually when no such event has occurred 
we evaluate the ongoing value of assets associated with retail stores that have been open longer than two years 
when events such as these occur  the assets subject to impairment are adjusted to estimated fair value and  if applicable  an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment  including current and future economic trends for stores  are subject to a high degree of judgment and if actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated  additional losses may be recorded 
income taxes we calculate income taxes and account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with current authoritative guidance 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the estimated tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we are also required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations are often complex  ambiguous and change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
insurance reserves we use a combination of self insurance and third party insurance for workers compensation  employee medical and general liability insurance 
these plans have stop loss provisions that protect us from individual and aggregate losses over specified dollar values 
when estimating our self insured liabilities  we consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors  statistical trends and  in certain instances  valuation assistance provided by independent third parties 
we will continue to evaluate our self insured liabilities and the underlying assumptions on a quarterly basis and make adjustments as needed 
the ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accruals 
while we believe that the recorded amounts are adequate  there can be no assurance that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimating process 
in the event we determine an accrual should be increased or reduced  we will record such adjustments in the period in which such determination is made 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the following fiscal years net sales cost of sales including buying  distribution  and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income in the regular course of business  we offer our customers sales incentives including coupons  discounts  and free merchandise 
sales are recorded net of such incentives and returns and allowances 
if an incentive involves free merchandise  that merchandise is recorded as a zero sale and the cost is included in cost of sales 
comparable store sales for the periods indicated below include stores that have been open for full months prior to the beginning of the period  including those stores that have been relocated or remodeled 
therefore  stores opened or closed during the periods indicated are not included in comparable store sales 
compared to net sales net sales increased million to million in fiscal  a increase from net sales of million in fiscal comparable store sales increased  or approximately million  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the stores opened in fiscal along with the effect of a full year s worth of sales from the stores opened in fiscal contributed an additional million in sales 
these sales increases were partially offset by the million of sales lost from the stores which were closed during the last two years 
gross profit gross profit increased million to million in fiscal  an increase from gross profit of million in fiscal the gross profit margin for fiscal increased to from in fiscal as a percentage of sales  the merchandise margin increased compared to the prior year  and buying  distribution and occupancy costs decreased 
through tight control of inventories  we were able to reduce the level of promotional selling on a year over year basis 
this  along with strong sales of boots and athletic footwear  positively affected our merchandise margin 
the leverage on our buying  distribution and occupancy costs was the result of the sales increase combined with a  decrease in expenses primarily due to cost saving initiatives in distribution logistics 
while additional occupancy costs were incurred for the operation of our new stores  these increases were largely offset by rent reductions on certain comparable stores  the elimination of rent from the stores closed during the past two years and lower store closing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  however  our sales gain enabled us to leverage these costs by  as a percentage of sales 
incentive compensation increased million on a year over year basis due to our improved financial performance 
expenses related to employee benefits increased million 
this increase was associated with our non qualified deferred compensation plan  which experienced an increase in value as a result of the rebound from the fiscal broad based decline in the stock market 
health care costs increased million in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in non cash asset impairments and disposal charges associated with store closings  along with other operational cost savings 
pre opening costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal we opened stores in fiscal as compared to stores in fiscal pre opening costs  such as advertising  payroll and supplies  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense in the period they are incurred 
the total amount of pre opening expense incurred will vary by store depending on the specific market and the promotional activities involved 
our average pre opening costs per store increased by  to  in fiscal  primarily as a result of an increase in advertising 
the portion of store closing costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal was  or as a percentage of sales 
these costs related to the closing of nine stores in fiscal and the impairment of assets and acceleration of expenses associated with management s determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods 
in fiscal  we incurred million  or as a percentage of sales  in costs related to the closing of stores and the impairment of assets and acceleration of expenses associated with management s determination to close certain underperforming stores in future periods 
we have identified stores to close in fiscal  five in fiscal  and one in fiscal however  the potential exists that further negotiations with our landlords could reverse our decision to close certain stores 
we will continue to evaluate underperforming stores  which may result in additional closings for current or future periods 
the timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly depending  in part  on the period in which management commits to a closing plan  the remaining basis in the fixed assets to be disposed of at closing and the amount of any lease buyout 
interest income and expense  net net interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily as a result of a reduction in interest income 
as returns available on short term investments fell to record lows  we held our excess funds for the first seven months of fiscal in non interest bearing deposit accounts to offset bank service fees  which are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was for fiscal and in fiscal the increase in rate between the two periods was primarily due to the federal tax rate falling below in fiscal as a result of lower projected income before tax 
compared to net sales net sales decreased million to million in fiscal  a decrease from net sales of million in fiscal comparable store sales decreased  or approximately million  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in net sales was partially offset by a million increase in sales generated by the stores opened in fiscal and the effect of a full year s worth of sales for the stores opened in fiscal  net of the sales loss from the stores which were closed during the last two years 
gross profit gross profit decreased million to million in fiscal  a decrease from gross profit of million in fiscal the gross profit margin for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal as a percentage of sales  the merchandise margin decreased compared to the prior year  while buying  distribution and occupancy costs increased 
as was seen across the retail sector  heavy promotions throughout the year were necessary to keep inventory turning at an acceptable level and consequently negatively impacted margins 
we experienced a increase in occupancy costs  as a percentage of sales  primarily as a result of the lower comparable store sales  an increase in costs due to the additional stores we operated throughout the year and additional store closing costs 
this increase  as a percentage of sales  was partially offset by a decline in distribution costs 
our distribution costs  both as a percentage of sales and in dollars  declined as a result of the increased costs associated with the conversion to our new distribution center during the first quarter of the prior year  a reduction in volume for fiscal and increased efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to during fiscal from in fiscal the savings in dollars was primarily the result of a million reduction in advertising costs from our decision to decrease advertising during non peak periods along with a million decrease in the expense for employee incentives and benefits 
these decreases were partially offset by million of additional costs incurred from the operation and support of the net new stores opened since the beginning of fiscal pre opening costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  in both fiscal and in fiscal we opened stores in fiscal as compared to stores in fiscal pre opening costs  such as advertising  payroll and supplies  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense in the period they are incurred 
the total amount of pre opening expense incurred will vary by store depending on the specific market and the promotional activities involved 
our average pre opening costs per store were  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the portion of store closing costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal was million  or as a percentage of sales 
these costs related to the closing of stores in fiscal and the impairment and acceleration of expenses associated with management s determination to close certain underperforming stores at future dates 
in fiscal  we incurred million  or as a percentage of sales  in costs related to the closing of five stores in fiscal and the impairment and acceleration of expenses associated with management s determination to close certain underperforming stores at future dates 
the timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly depending  in part  on the period in which management commits to a closing plan  the remaining basis in the fixed assets to be disposed of at closing and the amount of any lease buyout 
interest income and expense interest income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the rate available on investments 
interest expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal income taxes the effective income tax rate was for fiscal and in fiscal the effective income tax rate for both years differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state and local income taxes  net of the federal tax benefit and tax credits 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded  of state tax credits related to the investment in our new distribution center  which was the primary factor in reducing our effective tax rate in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our sources and uses of cash are summarized as follows in thousands net income plus depreciation and amortization   deferred income taxes  lease incentives   changes in operating assets and liabilities    other operating activities   net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by used in financing activities    net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents   our primary sources of funds are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal these amounts reflect the income from operations adjusted for non cash items and working capital changes 
working capital increased to million at january  from million at january  this was primarily attributable to a million increase in cash and cash equivalents and an million increase in merchandise inventories  partially offset by a million decrease in other current assets 
the current ratio at january  was and for january  was we had no outstanding interest bearing debt at january  or january  capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal no capital lease obligations were incurred during this three year period 
of the fiscal capital expenditures  approximately million was used for new stores  million was used for remodels and relocations and million was used to replace the software controlling the material handling equipment in our distribution center 
the remaining capital expenditures for fiscal were used for continued investments in technology and normal asset replacement activities 
lease incentives received from landlords were million  million and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
approximately  of the lease incentives received from landlords in fiscal represented monies that were negotiated for fiscal new stores and remodeling activities 
capital expenditures are expected to be million to million in fiscal we intend to open approximately to stores at an expected total cost of million to million and to expend up to million on remodeling activities 
lease incentives to be received from landlords are expected to be approximately million 
as part of our long term strategy to grow our store base and increase our distribution capabilities  we are in the process of redesigning certain elements of the material handling system in our distribution center 
accordingly  we anticipate expending million on these elements during fiscal the remaining capital expenditures are expected to be incurred for various other store improvements  along with continued investments in technology and normal asset replacement activities 
the actual amount of cash required for capital expenditures for store operations depends in part on the number of new stores opened  the amount of lease incentives  if any  received from landlords and the number of stores remodeled 
the opening of new stores will be dependent upon  among other things  the availability of desirable locations  and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms and general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending in areas we target for expansion 
our current store prototype uses between  and  square feet depending upon  among other factors  the location of the store and the population base the store is expected to service 
capital expenditures for a new store in fiscal are expected to average approximately  with landlord incentives averaging  the average inventory investment in a new store is expected to range from  to  depending on the size and sales expectation of the store and the timing of the new store opening 
pre opening expenses  such as advertising  salaries and supplies  are expected to average approximately  per store in fiscal this represents a  increase over our average fiscal expenditure 
the majority of the increase is attributable to our plan to significantly expand our advertising for new stores 
on a per store basis  for the stores opened during fiscal  the initial inventory investment averaged  capital expenditures averaged  and lease incentives received from landlords averaged  significant contractual obligations as of january  and the fiscal years in which payments are due include in thousands payments due by fiscal year and contractual obligations total after letters of credit   operating leases      purchase commitments   unrecognized tax positions   deferred compensation   total contractual obligations   we entered into a new unsecured credit agreement effective january  which provides for up to million in cash advances and commercial and standby letters of credit with borrowing limits based on eligible inventory 
it contains covenants which stipulate total shareholders equity  adjusted for the effect of any share repurchases  will not fall below that of the prior fiscal year end  the ratio of funded debt plus rent to ebitda plus rent will not exceed to  and cash dividends for a fiscal year will not exceed of consolidated net income for the immediately preceding fiscal year 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of january  should a default condition be reported  the lenders may preclude additional borrowings and call all loans and accrued interest at their discretion 
there were no borrowings outstanding or letters of credit outstanding under the new unsecured credit agreement at january  estimated interest payments on our line of credit are not included in the above table as our line of credit provides for frequent borrowing and or repayment activities which does not lend itself to reliable forecasting for disclosure purposes 
as of january   million was available to us for additional borrowings under the credit facility 
our prior unsecured credit agreement  which also provided for cash advances and the issuance of letters of credit  was set to mature on april  we did not incur early termination or prepayment penalties in connection with the replacement of this credit facility 
approximately million of commercial letters of credit and a standby letter of credit issued under this credit facility remained outstanding at january  the standby letter of credit was replaced during march under our new unsecured credit agreement with a similar instrument 
we will maintain cash and cash equivalents of a sufficient nature with the agent bank until such time all letters of credit have expired 
we anticipate all remaining commercial letters of credit issued under our prior unsecured credit agreement will be satisfied prior to the end of the first quarter of fiscal for purposes of our contractual obligations table above  we have assumed that we will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date 
we have disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended  whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement between us and the counterparty  due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension 
except for operating leases  the balances included in the and after column of the contractual obligations table includes amounts where we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the potential future payments 
we anticipate that our existing cash and cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our revolving credit line  will be sufficient to fund our planned store expansion along with other capital expenditures and other operating cash requirements for at least the next months 
see note long term debt  note leases  note income taxes and note employee benefit plans to our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this report for a further discussion of our contractual obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not assign any store operating leases to separate third parties during fiscal we remain liable on three assignments of operating leases covering former store locations 
we believe that the likelihood of material liability being triggered under these leases is remote  and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations in our consolidated financial statements as of january  see note leases to our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this report for further discussion 
except for the assignment of certain store operating leases and operating leases entered into in the normal course of business  we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements during fiscal or fiscal  nor did we have any off balance sheet arrangements outstanding at january  or january  seasonality our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future  primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores 
non capital expenditures  such as advertising and payroll  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense as incurred 
therefore  our results of operations may be adversely affected in any quarter in which we incur pre opening expenses related to the opening of new stores 
we have three distinct peak selling periods easter  back to school and christmas 
new accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our operations are contained in note summary of significant accounting policies  contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in that the interest payable on our credit facility is based on variable interest rates and therefore is affected by changes in market rates 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in market interest rates 
we had no borrowings under our credit facility during fiscal a change in the weighted average interest rate charged under the credit facility would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating by less than one thousand dollars in fiscal
