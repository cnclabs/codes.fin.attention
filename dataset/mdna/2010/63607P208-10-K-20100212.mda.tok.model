executive overview the company is a leading independent financial services distribution company 
the company offers high net worth individuals and companies throughout the united states and in canada comprehensive solutions across corporate and executive benefits  life insurance and wealth transfer  and investment advisory products and services 
founded in  and commencing operations on january   nfp has grown internally and through acquisitions and  as of december   operates a national distribution network with over owned firms 
the company acquired  and firms in   and  respectively 
during the year ended december   revenue decreased million or  to million from  million during the year ended december  the company experienced a net loss of million for the year ended december   a decrease of from net income of million during the year ended december  the net loss was due to a substantial increase in the level of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets from million to million for the year ended december  excluding the after tax impact of impairments  the net income decline was a result of lower revenue  particularly in life insurance  partially offset by declines in cost of services and general and administrative expense 
the company s firms earn revenue that consists primarily of commissions and fees earned from the sale of financial products and services to their clients 
the company s firms also incur commissions and fees expense and operating expense in the course of earning revenue 
nfp pays management fees to non employee principals of its firms and or certain entities they own based on the financial performance of each respective firm 
the company refers to revenue earned by the company s firms less the expenses of its firms  including management fees  as gross margin 
the company excludes amortization and depreciation from gross margin 
these amounts are separately disclosed as part of corporate and other expenses 
management uses gross margin as a measure of the performance of the firms that the company has acquired 
gross margin declined from million in to million in during  the company experienced continued declines in revenue from its retail life and life settlements products and also experienced less severe declines in its benefits and financial advisory revenue which contributed to the decline in revenue and gross margin during the year 
the decline in revenue offset positive trends in the other variable components of the company s cost structure as the company recorded lowered commission and fees expense and operating expenses in than in the prior year 
these factors contributed to the decline in the company s gross margin in as compared to growth it had experienced in years prior to the company s gross margin is offset by expenses that it incurred at the corporate level  including corporate and other expenses 
corporate and other expenses have increased from million in to million in primarily due to an impairment charge of million during corporate and other expenses include general and administrative expenses  which are the operating expenses of nfp s corporate headquarters 
general and administrative expenses have grown from million in to million in general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased from in to in the company recognized an impairment charge of million  million  million and million during the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively  of as a result  the company recognized an impairment charge of million during the year ended december  as compared to the million impairment charge for the prior year 

table of contents many external factors affect the company s revenue and profitability  including economic and market conditions  legislative and regulatory developments and competition 
because many of these factors are unpredictable and generally beyond the company s control  the company s revenue and earnings may fluctuate from year to year and quarter to quarter 
the company s revenue and net income  particularly in the second half of and early  benefited from strong sales of financed life insurance products 
management believes that sales of financed life insurance products diminished in the second half of and this declining trend continued through the company experienced continued declines in its life insurance revenue in which led to the overall decline in revenue and margins and offset gains in gross margin through the first half of in  the decline in gross margin reflected the challenging economic environment which worsened in the second half of during  the company experienced continued declines in its retail life and life settlements products and also experienced less severe declines in its benefits and financial advisory revenue which contributed to the decline in revenue and margins during the year 
while the challenging economic and market environment is showing signs of stabilization  there is considerable uncertainty as to the scope of any economic recovery 
additionally  poor economic conditions during the latter part of largely continued in financial market volatility and a distressed economic environment may reduce the demand for the company s services or the products the company distributes and could negatively affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in light of the financial environment  nfp has taken certain steps to streamline operations and conserve available cash and continues to explore further expense reductions 
with the exception of certain sub acquisitions  nfp does not anticipate completing acquisitions until market conditions and financial results improve 
nfp continues to consider actions designed to strengthen its financial position  including evaluating its capital structure or further reducing indebtedness 
in september  nfp announced corporate reorganizational efforts that are intended to enhance the company s client service delivery structure 
acquisitions while acquisitions remain a component of the company s business strategy over the long term  nfp suspended acquisition activity with the exception of certain sub acquisitions or other limited strategic transactions in the latter part of in order to conserve cash 
nfp continues to assess the market and economic environment 
under nfp s typical acquisition structure  nfp acquires of the equity of businesses that distribute financial services products on terms that are relatively standard across its acquisitions 
to determine the acquisition price  nfp s management first estimates the annual operating cash flow of the business to be acquired based on current levels of revenue and expense 
for this purpose  management defines operating cash flow as cash revenue of the business less cash and non cash expenses  other than amortization  depreciation and compensation to the business owners or individuals who subsequently become principals 
management refers to this estimated annual operating cash flow as target earnings 
typically  the acquisition price is a multiple generally in a range of five to six times of a portion of the target earnings  which management refers to as base earnings 
under certain circumstances  nfp has paid multiples in excess of six times based on the unique attributes of the transaction that in the company s view justify the higher value 
base earnings averaged of target earnings for all firms owned at december  this percentage can vary based on the percentage of base earnings acquired  disposed  and or restructured 
in determining base earnings  management focuses on the recurring revenue of the business 
recurring revenue refers to revenue from sales previously made such as renewal commissions on insurance products  commissions and administrative fees for ongoing benefits plans and mutual fund trail commissions and fees for assets under management 
nfp enters into a management contract with principals and or certain entities they own 
under the terms of the management contract  the principals and or such entities are entitled to management fees consisting of all future earnings of the acquired business in excess of the base earnings up to target earnings  and a percentage of any earnings in excess of target earnings generally based on the ratio of base earnings to target earnings 

table of contents nfp typically retains a cumulative preferred position in the base earnings 
to the extent earnings of a firm in any year are less than base earnings  in the following year nfp is entitled to receive base earnings together with the prior years shortfall before any management fees are paid 
in certain transactions later in the company s operating history involving large institutional sellers  the company has provided minimum guaranteed compensation to certain former employees of the seller who became principals of the acquired business 
additional purchase consideration may be paid to the former owners upon satisfying specified internal growth thresholds over the three year period following the acquisition 
sub acquisitions a sub acquisition involves the acquisition by one of the company s firms of a business that is generally too small to qualify for a direct acquisition by nfp or where the individual running the business wishes to exit immediately or soon after the acquisition  prefers to partner with an existing principal or does not wish to become a principal 
the acquisition multiple paid for sub acquisitions is typically lower than the multiple paid for a direct acquisition by nfp 
for the years ended december  in thousands  except number of acquisitions closed number of acquisitions closed consideration cash common stock other a a represents other consideration and capitalized costs of the acquisitions for prior years 
although management believes that nfp will continue to have opportunities to complete acquisitions once market conditions stabilize  there can be no assurance that nfp will be successful in identifying and completing acquisitions see risk factors the company may not resume acquisitions or may be unsuccessful in acquiring suitable acquisition candidates  which could adversely affect the company s growth 
any change in the company s financial condition or in the environment of the markets in which the company operates could impact its ability to source and complete acquisitions 
restructures and disposals certain businesses acquired by nfp have been adversely affected by changes in the markets served  necessitating a change in the economic relationship between nfp and the principals 
for the year ended december   nfp has restructured transactions  of which had been previously restructured 
these restructures generally result in either temporary or permanent reductions in base and target earnings and or changes in the ratio of base to target earnings and the principals typically paying cash  surrendering nfp common stock  issuing notes or other concessions by principals 
as part of the restructures that occurred during the year ended december   the company received greater operating control over the restructured firms  including expense control and limitations on management fee advances 
such restructures are an indicator of a need to assess whether an impairment exists 
see expenses corporate and other expenses impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
at times  the company may dispose of firms  certain business units within a firm or firm assets for one or more of the following reasons non performance  changes resulting in firms no longer being part of the company s core business  change in competitive environment  regulatory changes  the cultural incompatibility of 
table of contents an acquired firm s management team with the company  change of business interests of a principal or other issues personal to a principal 
in certain instances nfp sells operating companies back to the principals 
principals generally buy back businesses by surrendering all of their nfp common stock and paying cash or issuing nfp a note 
for the year ended december   nfp has disposed of firms and certain assets of more firms 
revenue the company s firms generate revenue primarily from the following sources corporate and executive benefits commissions and fees 
the company s firms earn commissions on the sale of insurance policies written for benefits programs 
the commissions are paid each year as long as the client continues to use the product and maintains its broker of record relationship with the firm 
the company s firms also earn fees for the development  implementation and administration of corporate and executive benefits programs 
asset based fees are also earned for administrative services or consulting related to certain benefits plans 
some of the company s firms offer property and casualty insurance brokerage and advisory services 
the company believes that these services complement the corporate and executive benefits services provided to the company s clients 
in connection with these services  the company earns commissions and fees 
life insurance commissions and estate planning fees 
insurance and annuity commissions paid by insurance companies are based on a percentage of the premium that the insurance company charges to the policyholder 
first year commissions are calculated as a percentage of the first months premium on the policy and earned in the year that the policy is originated 
in many cases  the company s firms receive renewal commissions for a period following the first year 
some of the company s firms receive fees for the settlement of life insurance policies 
these fees are generally based on a percentage of the settlement proceeds 
the company s firms also earn fees for developing estate plans 
revenue from life insurance activities also includes amounts received by the company s life brokerage entities  including its life settlements brokerage entities  that assist non affiliated producers with the placement and sale of life insurance 
financial planning and investment advisory fees and securities commissions 
the company s firms earn commissions related to the sale of securities and certain investment related insurance products  as well as fees for offering financial advice and related services 
these fees are based on a percentage of assets under management and are generally paid quarterly 
in a few cases  incentive fees are earned based on the performance of the assets under management 
some of the company s firms charge flat fees for the development of a financial plan or a flat fee annually for advising clients on asset allocation 
some of the company s firms also earn additional compensation in the form of incentive and marketing support revenue from manufacturers of financial services products  based on the volume  persistency and profitability of business generated by the company from these three sources 
incentive and marketing support revenue is recognized at the earlier of notification of a payment or when payment is received  unless historical data or other information exists which enables management to reasonably estimate the amount earned during the period 
these forms of payment are earned both with respect to sales by the company s owned firms and sales by nfp s affiliated third party distributors 
nfpsi  nfp s registered broker dealer and investment adviser  also earns commissions and fees on the transactions it conducts 
most principals of the company s firms  as well as many of the company s affiliated third party distributors  conduct securities or investment advisory business through nfpsi 
although nfp s operating history is limited  historically a significant number of its firms earn approximately to of their revenue in the first three quarters of the year and approximately to of their revenue in the fourth quarter 
in  nfp earned of its revenue in the fourth quarter 
in  nfp 
table of contents earned of its revenue in the fourth quarter 
a continued difficult economic environment may result in a change in this historical pattern for the year ended december   as was the case for the years ended december  and december  expenses the following table sets forth certain expenses as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated for the years ended december  revenue cost of services commissions and fees operating expenses management fees total cost of services excludes items shown separately below gross margin corporate and other expenses general and administrative amortization depreciation impairment of goodwill and intangible assets management agreement buyout gain on sale of businesses total corporate and other expenses excludes amortization and depreciation which are shown separately under corporate and other expenses 
excludes management agreement buyout which is shown separately under corporate and other expenses 
cost of services commissions and fees 
commissions and fees are typically paid to third party producers  who are producers that are affiliated with the company s firms 
commission and fees are also paid to non affiliated producers who utilize the services of one or more of the company s life brokerage entities  including the company s life settlements brokerage entities 
additionally  commissions and fees are paid to non affiliated producers who provide referrals and specific product expertise to nfp s firms 
when business is generated solely by a principal  no commission expense is incurred because principals are only paid from a share of the cash flow of the acquired firm through management fees 
however  when income is generated by a third party producer  the producer is generally paid a portion of the commission income  which is reflected as commission expense of the acquired firm 
rather than collecting the full commission and remitting a portion to a third party producer  a firm may include the third party producer on the policy application submitted to a carrier 
the carrier will  in these instances  directly pay each named producer their respective share of the commissions and fees earned 
when this occurs the firm will record only the commissions and fees it receives directly as revenue and has no commission expense 
as a result  the nfp firm will have lower revenue and commission expense and a higher gross margin percentage 
gross margin dollars will be the same 
the transactions in which an nfp firm is listed as the sole producer and pays commissions to a third party producer  versus transactions in which the carrier pays each producer directly  will cause nfp s gross margin percentage to fluctuate without affecting gross margin dollars or earnings 
in addition  nfpsi pays commissions to the company s affiliated third party distributors who transact business through nfpsi 

table of contents operating expenses 
the company s firms incur operating expenses related to maintaining individual offices  including compensating producing and non producing staff 
firm operating expenses also include the expenses of nfpsi and of nfpisi  two subsidiaries that serve the company s acquired firms and through which the company s acquired firms and its third party distributors who are members of its marketing organizations access insurance and financial services products and manufacturers 
the company records share based payments related to firm employees and firm activities to operating expenses as a component of cost of services 
management fees 
nfp pays management fees to the principals of its firms and or certain entities they own based on the financial performance of the firms they manage 
nfp typically pays a portion of the management fees monthly in advance 
once nfp earns its cumulative preferred earnings  or base earnings  from a firm  the principals and or entity the principals own will earn management fees equal to earnings above base earnings up to target earnings 
an additional management fee is paid in respect of earnings in excess of target earnings based on the ratio of base earnings to target earnings 
for example  if base earnings equal of target earnings  nfp receives of earnings in excess of target earnings and the principals and or the entities they own receives 
a majority of the company s acquisitions have been completed with a ratio of base earnings to target earnings of 
management fees also include an accrual for certain performance based incentive amounts payable under nfp s ongoing incentive plan  the pip and the eip 
incentive amounts are paid in a combination of cash and nfp s common stock 
for firms electing to continue to participate in the ongoing incentive plan  in addition to the incentive award  nfp pays an additional cash incentive equal to of the incentive award elected to be received in nfp common stock 
this election is made subsequent to the completion of the incentive period 
for firms that began their incentive period prior to january   the principal could elect from to to be paid in nfp s common stock 
no accrual is made for these additional cash incentives until the incentive award is earned and the related election is made 
however  for firms beginning their incentive period on or after january  with the exception of highland capital holding corporation firms which completed this incentive period in  the principal is required to take a minimum of maximum of of the incentive award in nfp common stock 
the company accrues on a current basis for these firms the additional cash incentive of the stock portion of the award based upon the principal s election on the minimum percentage required to be received in company stock 
since december  nfp has elected to pay all incentive awards under the ongoing incentive plan in cash 
management fees are reduced by amounts paid by the principals and or certain entities they own under the terms of the management contract for capital expenditures  including sub acquisitions  in excess of  these amounts may be paid in full or over a mutually agreeable period of time and are recorded as a deferred reduction in management fees 
amounts recorded in deferred reduction in management fees are amortized as a reduction in management fee expense generally over the useful life of the asset 
the ratio of management fees to gross margin before management fees is dependent on the percentage of total earnings of the company s firms capitalized by the company  the performance of the company s firms relative to base earnings and target earnings  the growth of earnings of the company s firms in the periods after their first three years following acquisition and the earnings of nfpisi  nfpsi and a small number of firms without a principal  to whom which no management fees are paid 
due to nfp s cumulative preferred position  if a firm produces earnings below target earnings in a given year  nfp s share of the firm s total earnings would be higher for that year 
if a firm produces earnings at or above target earnings  nfp s share of the firm s total earnings would be equal to the percentage of the earnings capitalized by nfp in the initial transaction  less any percentage due to additional management fees earned under the ongoing incentive plan 
the company records share based payments related to principals as management fees which are included as a component of cost of services 
the table below summarizes the results of operations of nfp s firms for the periods presented and uses the following non gaap measures i gross margin before management fees  ii gross margin before management fees as a percentage of total revenue and iii management fees  as a percentage of gross margin before management fees 
gross margin before management fees represents the profitability of the company s business before principals receive participation in the earnings 
gross margin before management fees as a percentage of 
table of contents total revenue represents the base profitability of the company divided by the total revenue of the company s business 
whether or not a principal participates in the earnings of a firm is dependent on the specific characteristics and performance of that firm 
management fees as a percentage of gross margin before management fees represents the percentage of earnings that is not retained by the company as profit  but is paid out to principals 
for the years ended december  in thousands revenue commissions and fees cost of services commissions and fees operating expenses gross margin before management fees management fees gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenue gross margin before management fees as a percentage of revenue management fees  as a percentage of gross margin before management fees excludes amortization and depreciation which are shown separately under corporate and other expenses 
excludes management agreement buyout which is shown separately under corporate and other expenses 
the company uses gross margin before management fees and gross margin before management fees as a percentage of total revenue to evaluate how the company s business is performing before giving consideration to a principal s participation in their firm s earnings 
this measure is one for which the principal is compensated and reflects the principal s performance and is a result of their direct operating authority and control 
management fees as a percentage of gross margin before management fees is a measure that management uses to evaluate how much of the company s margin and margin growth is being shared with principals 
this management fee percentage is a variable  not a fixed  ratio 
management fees as a percentage of gross margin before management fees will fluctuate based upon the aggregate mix of earnings performance by individual firms 
it is based on the percentage of the company s earnings that are capitalized at the time of acquisition  the performance relative to nfp s cumulative preferred position in the earnings and the growth of the individual firms for further discussion on the acquisition model and management fee structure  see business acquisitions acquisition model 
management fees may be higher during periods of strong growth due to the increase in incentive accruals 
higher firm earnings will generally be accompanied by higher incentive accruals 
where firm earnings decrease  management fees and management fee percentage may be lower as firms earnings fall below target and incentive accruals are either reduced or eliminated 
in addition  because management fees earned are based on a firm s cumulative performance through the year  to the extent that a firm s performance improves through the year  whether by revenue growth or expense reductions  the management fee percentage may likewise increase through the year 
for example  if a firm has base earnings and target earnings of million and million  respectively  and if the firm s cumulative earnings are million for the first nine months of the year  no management fee would be earned and the management fee percentage would be zero 
in the remaining fourth quarter  if the firm was able to achieve cumulative earnings of million  the management fee earned would be million and the management fee percentage would be equal to approximately for the quarter 
further  since nfp retains a cumulative preferred interest in base earnings  the relative percentage of management fees generally decreases as firm earnings decline 
for firms that do not achieve base earnings  principals typically earn no management fee 
thus  a principal generally earns more management fees only when firm earnings grow and  conversely  principals earn less when firm earnings decline 
this structure provides the company with protection against earnings shortfalls through reduced management fee expense  in this manner the interests of the principals and shareholders remain aligned 

table of contents management uses these non gaap measures to evaluate the performance of its firms and the results of the company s model 
this cannot be effectively illustrated using the corresponding gaap measures as management fees would be included in these gaap measures and produce a less meaningful measure for this evaluation 
on a firm specific basis the company uses these measures to help the company determine where to allocate corporate and other resources to assist firm principals to develop additional sources of revenue and improve their earnings performance 
the company may assist these firms in expense reductions  cross selling  providing new products or services  technology improvements  providing capital for sub acquisitions or coordinating internal mergers 
on a macro level  the company uses these measurements to help it evaluate broad performance of products and services which  in turn  helps shape the company s acquisition policy 
in recent years  the company has emphasized acquiring businesses with a higher level of recurring revenue  such as benefits businesses  and those which expand the company s platform capabilities 
the company also may use these measures to help it assess the level of economic ownership to retain in new acquisitions or existing firms 
finally  the company uses these measures to monitor the effectiveness of its incentive plans 
management fees were of gross margin before management fees in compared with in and in in  the increase in management fee percentage was largely due to the increase in the accrual during the fourth quarter for the pip of million 
excluding the effect of the pip  the management fee percentage was lower compared with the prior year period due to a decline in the ongoing incentive plan accrual  lower firm earnings and an increase in nfpisi s contribution to gross margin before management fees  an entity for which no management fees are paid 
in  as gross margin before management fees as a percentage of revenue declined  the principals percentage participation in those earnings also declined 
new incentive plans 
for a discussion of new incentive plans  please see note commitments and contingencies new incentive plans 
the amounts that have been accrued relating to the new incentive plans in effect at december  have been largely recorded through management fee expense 
a lesser portion of expense for the eip was expensed within operating expenses relating to firm activities and relating to equity awards granted to certain firm employees at the discretion of principals 
corporate and other expenses general and administrative 
at the corporate level  the company incurs general and administrative expense related to the acquisition of and administration of its firms 
general and administrative expense includes both cash and stock based compensation  occupancy  professional fees  travel and entertainment  technology  telecommunication  advertising and marketing  legal  internal audit and certain corporate compliance costs 
amortization 
the company incurs amortization expense related to the amortization of certain identifiable intangible assets 
depreciation 
the company incurs depreciation expense related to capital assets  such as investments in technology  office furniture and equipment  as well as amortization for its leasehold improvements 
depreciation expense related to the company s firms as well as nfp s corporate office is recorded within this line item 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
the company evaluates its amortizing long lived assets and non amortizing intangible assets for impairment in accordance with gaap 
in accordance with gaap  long lived assets  such as purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company generally performs its recoverability test on a quarterly basis for each of its acquired firms that has experienced a significant deterioration in its business indicated principally by either an inability to produce base earnings for a period of time or in the event of a restructure in base 

table of contents recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and by the eventual disposition of the asset 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the underlying asset  an impairment may exist 
the company measures impairments on identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying amount of the asset 
in the event that the discounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment charge will be recognized for the difference in the consolidated statements of operations 
in accordance with gaap  goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested at least annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the intangible asset might be impaired 
the company generally performs its impairment test on a quarterly basis for each of its acquired firms that may have an indicator of impairment 
indicators at the company level include but are not limited to sustained operating losses or a trend of poor operating performance  which may cause the terms of the applicable management contract to be restructured  loss of key personnel  a decrease in nfp s market capitalization below its book value  and an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
indicators of impairment at the reporting unit level may be due to the failure of the firms the company acquires to perform as expected after the acquisition for various reasons  including legislative or regulatory changes that affect the products and services in which a firm specializes  the loss of key clients after acquisition  general economic factors that impact a firm in a direct way  and the death or disability of significant principals 
if one or more indicators of impairment exist  nfp performs an evaluation to identify potential impairments 
if an impairment is identified  nfp measures and records the amount of impairment loss 
a two step impairment test is performed on goodwill for reporting units that demonstrate indicators of impairment 
in the first step  nfp compares the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit 
nfp determines the fair value of its reporting units by blending two valuation approaches the income approach and a market value approach 
in order to determine the relative fair value of each of the reporting units the income approach was conducted first 
these relative values were then scaled to the estimated market value of nfp 
on january  the company adopted new guidance related to accounting for non financial assets and liabilities  which emphasizes market based measurement  rather than entity specific measurement  in calculating reporting unit fair value 
in applying the market value approach  management derived an enterprise value of the company as a whole as of december   taking into consideration nfp s stock price  an appropriate equity premium and the current capital structure 
the market value approach was used to derive the implied equity value of the entity as a whole which was then allocated to the individual reporting units based on the proportional fair value of each reporting unit derived using the income approach to the total entity fair value derived using the income approach 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and nfp is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner that is consistent with the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
as referenced above  the method to compute the amount of impairment incorporates quantitative data and qualitative criteria including new information and judgments that can dramatically change the decision about the 
table of contents valuation of an intangible asset in a very short period of time 
the timing and amount of realized losses reported in earnings could vary if management s conclusions were different 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on the company s reported financial position and results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period 
as previously disclosed  nfp carefully monitors both the expected future cash flows of its reporting units and its market capitalization for the purpose of assessing the carrying values of its goodwill and intangible assets 
as further stated  if the stock price remained below the net book value per share  or other negative business factors existed as outlined in the relevant accounting guidance  nfp may be required to perform another step analysis and potentially a step analysis  which could result in an impairment of up to the entire balance of the company s remaining goodwill  if nfp performed a step goodwill impairment analysis as defined by gaap  it would also be required to evaluate its intangible assets for impairment under gaap 
nfp s impairment analysis for the year ended december   consistent with the analysis previously provided  led to the impairment charge of million taken for the year ended december  in accordance with the provisions of gaap  long lived assets held and used were written down to their fair value  resulting in an impairment charge of million for amortizing intangibles  which was included in earnings for the year ended december  of this million  an impairment charge of million was recognized for the three months ended march  in accordance with the provisions of gaap  goodwill and trade name was written down to its implied fair value  resulting in an impairment charge of million  which was included in earnings for the year ended december  of this million  an impairment charge of million was recognized for the three months ended march  management agreement buyout 
from time to time  nfp may seek to acquire an additional economic interest in one of its existing firms through the acquisition of a principals ownership interest in a management company which has been contracted by nfp to manage and operate one of its wholly owned subsidiaries 
the acquisition of this ownership interest will be treated for accounting purposes as the settlement of an executory contract in a business combination between parties with a preexisting relationship and expensed as part of corporate and other expenses 
gain on sale of businesses 
from time to time  nfp has disposed of acquired firms or certain assets of acquired firms 
in these dispositions  nfp may realize a gain or loss on the sale of acquired firms or certain assets of acquired firms 
results of operations in  the company experienced continued declines in its retail life  life brokerage and life settlements products and also experienced less severe declines in its benefits and financial advisory revenue which contributed to the decline in revenue and margins during the year 
the decline in revenue was partially offset by positive trends in the other variable components of the company s cost structure as the company recorded lowered commission and fees expense and operating expenses in than in in  revenue declined while revenue grew in this growth was driven  in  primarily by the company s acquisitions and in previous years through a combination of acquisitions and internal growth in the revenue of its acquired firms  augmented by the growth of nfpisi and nfpsi 
in and  the company s firms had an internal revenue growth rate decline of and  respectively 
in  the company s firms had an internal revenue growth rate of less than 
as a measure of financial performance  nfp calculates the internal growth rate of the revenue of the company s firms 
this calculation compares the change in revenue of a comparable group of firms for the same time period in successive years 
nfp includes firms in this calculation at the beginning of the first fiscal quarter that begins one year after acquisition by the company unless a firm has internally consolidated with another owned firm or has made a sub acquisition that represents more than of the base earnings of the acquiring firm  or a significant portion of the firm s assets have been sold 
with respect to two owned firms that internally 
table of contents consolidate  the combined firm is excluded from the calculation from the time of the internal consolidation until the first fiscal quarter that begins one year after acquisition by nfp of the most recently acquired firm participating in the internal consolidation 
however  if both firms involved in an internal consolidation are included in the internal growth rate calculation at the time of the internal consolidation  the combined firm continues to be included in the calculation after the internal consolidation 
with respect to situations where a significant portion of a firm s assets have been sold  the surviving entity is excluded from the internal growth rate calculation from the time of the sale until one year following the sale 
with respect to the sub acquisitions described above  to the extent the sub acquired firm does not separately report financial statements to nfp  the acquiring firm is excluded from the calculation from the time of the sub acquisition until the first fiscal quarter beginning one year following the sub acquisition 
sub acquisitions that represent less than of the base earnings of the acquiring firms are considered to be internal growth 
for further information about sub acquisitions  see business acquisitions sub acquisitions 
with respect to dispositions  nfp includes these firms up to the time of disposition and excludes these firms for all periods after the disposition 
the calculation is adjusted for intercompany transactions for all periods after december  management believes that the intercompany adjustments made to the internal revenue growth rate for periods after december  does not significantly impact its comparability with prior year periods 
management also monitors acquired firm revenue  commissions and fees expense and operating expense from new acquisitions as compared with existing firms 
for this purpose  a firm is considered to be a new acquisition for the twelve months following the acquisition 
after the first twelve months  a firm is considered to be an existing firm 
within any reported period  a firm may be considered to be a new acquisition for part of the period and an existing firm for the remainder of the period

the increase in cash usage during the first quarter of the year generally requires increased borrowings under nfp s credit facility  but this did not occur for the year ending december  as the year progresses  cash flow typically improves as earnings increase and acquisition activities moderate 
nfp generally reduces the borrowings under its credit facility by using this increased cash flow

nfp s credit facility is structured as a revolving credit facility and matures on august  nfp may elect to pay down its outstanding balance at any time before august  but repayment is not required before that date 
nfp s classification of this obligation as a current liability has been driven by nfp s practice of drawing against the credit line during the year and subsequently repaying significant amounts of the borrowing

those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to nfp if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time 
any disruption in the ability to borrow could require nfp to take measures to conserve cash until markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for its business needs could be arranged 
third amendment on may   nfp entered into the third amendment to its credit agreement 
under the terms of the third amendment  the definition of ebitda has been amended to expressly provide that the non cash impairment of goodwill and intangible assets associated with the company s evaluation of intangible assets for the first quarter of in accordance with gaap will be disregarded in the calculation of ebitda 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants 
however  if the company s earnings deteriorate  it is possible that nfp would fail to comply with the terms of its credit facility  such as the consolidated leverage ratio covenant  and therefore be in default under the credit facility 
upon the occurrence of such event of default  the majority of lenders under the credit facility could cause amounts currently outstanding to be declared immediately due and payable 
such an acceleration could trigger cross acceleration provisions under nfp s indenture governing the notes  see convertible senior notes below 

table of contents as of december  the year to date weighted average interest rate for nfp s credit facility was 
the combined weighted average of nfp s credit facility in the prior year was 
nfp had a balance of million outstanding under its credit facility as of december   below the maximum allowable balance of million

the notes will be convertible  regardless of the foregoing circumstances  at any time from  and including  december  through the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date 
default under the credit facility resulting in its acceleration would  subject to a day grace period  trigger a default under the supplemental indenture governing the notes  in which case the trustee under the notes or the holders of not less than in principal amount of the notes could accelerate the payment of the notes 
upon conversion  nfp will pay  at its election  cash or a combination of cash and common stock based on a daily conversion value calculated on a proportionate basis for each trading day of the relevant trading day observation period 
the initial conversion rate for the notes was shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
the conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest 
in addition  if a fundamental change as defined in the first supplemental indenture governing the notes occurs prior to the maturity date  nfp will  in some cases and subject to certain limitations  increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its notes in connection with such fundamental change 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  nfp entered into a convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with an affiliate of one of the underwriters for the notes 
the transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution to nfp s common stock upon future conversions of the notes 
under the convertible note hedge nfp purchased  call options for an aggregate premium of million 
each call option entitles nfp to repurchase an equivalent number of shares issued upon conversion of the notes at the same strike price initially per share  generally subject to the same adjustments 
the call options expire on the maturity date of the notes 
nfp also sold warrants for an aggregate premium of million 
the warrants expire ratably over a period of scheduled trading days between may  and june   on which dates  if not previously exercised  the warrants will be treated as automatically exercised if they are in the money 
the warrants provide for net share settlement 
the net cost of the convertible note hedge and warrants to the company is million 
debt issuance costs associated with the notes of approximately million are recorded in other current and non current assets and will be amortized over the term of the notes 

table of contents nfp received proceeds from the issuance of the notes  net of underwriting fees and the cost of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions  of approximately million of which million was used to repurchase million shares of nfp common stock from apollo in a privately negotiated transaction and million was used to pay down balances outstanding under nfp s credit facility 
apollo received the same proceeds per share  net of underwriting discounts  for the shares it sold pursuant to the repurchase and in the january secondary public offering  on an aggregate basis  as the other selling stockholders received for the shares they sold in the offering 
adoption of new accounting guidance on january   the company adopted new guidance related to the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
the new guidance applies to nfp s convertible senior notes see note borrowings 
the new guidance requires nfp to separate the convertible senior notes into two separate components a non convertible note and a conversion option 
as a result  nfp is required to recognize interest expense on its convertible senior notes at their non convertible debt borrowing rate rather than at their stated face rate 
with the change in accounting principle required by the new guidance  nfp is required to amortize to interest expense the excess of the principal amount of the liability component of its notes over the carrying amount using the interest method  and the non cash portion of interest expense relating to the discount on the notes is now recognized as a charge to earnings 
the new guidance does not have any impact on cash payments or obligations due under the terms of the notes 
as required  effective january   nfp s comparative financial statements of prior years have been adjusted to apply its provisions retrospectively 
for more detail on the effects of the change in accounting principle  see note summary of significant accounting policies recently adopted accounting standards

for the year ended december   the amount of interest expense incurred by nfp relating to the notes for cash interest paid and for the amortization of the discount is approximately million 
as of december  the conversion rate for the notes is shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
as of december  the instrument s converted value did not exceed its principal amount of million 
dividends on november   nfp s board of directors suspended nfp s quarterly cash dividend 
previously  nfp paid a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock on january   april   july  and october  the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of nfp s common stock will be at the discretion of nfp s board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including the company s financial condition  earnings  legal requirements  and other factors as nfp s board of directors deems relevant 
notes receivable the company encourages succession planning in the management of its firms 
see business operations succession planning 
nfp has financed several purchases of interests in entities owned by principals or applicable management agreements to facilitate succession 
this financing is secured by management fees and  in other cases  is secured by other assets 

table of contents nfp typically advances management fees monthly to principals and or certain entities they own for up to nine months while monitoring the performance of the firms to determine if the actual earnings are on track to meet or exceed target earnings 
if earnings are not equal to or greater than pro rata target earnings  nfp ceases to pay or reduces the management fee advance 
if an over advance of a management fee exists  the principal and or such entities are expected to repay the advance within days of the end of the calendar year 
if a principal and or such entities cannot repay the over advance  nfp has allowed principals and or such entities to repay the advance over time 
in these cases  nfp generally requires the principals and or such entities to provide it with an interest bearing note in an amount equal to the over advance  generally secured by the principals and or such entities shares of nfp s common stock and in some cases  is secured by other assets 
the company has from time to time disposed of firms 
nfp has also agreed  in certain cases  to reduce the levels of base earnings and target earnings in exchange for a payment from the principals of a firm 
in these situations  nfp typically takes back a note for a portion of the cost of the disposition or the restructuring to the principal 
as of the following dates  notes receivable were as follows as of december  in thousands notes from principals and or certain entities they own notes received in connection with dispositions other notes receivable less allowance for uncollectible notes total notes receivable  net nfp considers applying a reserve to a promissory note when it becomes apparent that conditions exist that may lead to nfp s inability to fully collect on outstanding amounts due 
such conditions include delinquent or late payments on loans  deterioration in the credit worthiness of the borrower  and other relevant factors 
when such conditions lead to an expectation of a loss  nfp generally applies a reserve to the uncollateralized portion of the promissory note 
the reserve is generally based on nfp s payment and collection experience  and whether nfp has an ongoing relationship with the borrower 
in instances where the borrower is a principal  nfp has the contractual right to offset management fees earned with any payments due under a promissory note 
commitments and contingencies legal matters in the ordinary course of business  the company is involved in lawsuits and other claims 
management considers these lawsuits and claims to be without merit and the company intends to defend them vigorously 
in addition  the sellers of firms that the company acquires typically indemnify the company for loss or liability resulting from acts or omissions occurring prior to the acquisition  whether or not the sellers were aware of these acts or omissions 
several of the existing lawsuits and claims have triggered these indemnity obligations 
in addition to the foregoing lawsuits and claims  during  several of the company s firms received subpoenas and other informational requests from governmental authorities  including the new york attorney general s office  seeking information regarding compensation arrangements  any evidence of bid rigging and related matters 
the company has cooperated and will continue to cooperate fully with all governmental agencies 

table of contents in march  nfp received a subpoena from the new york attorney general s office seeking information regarding life settlement transactions 
one of nfp s subsidiaries received a subpoena seeking the same information 
the company is cooperating fully with the attorney general s investigation 
the investigation  however  is ongoing and the company is unable to predict the investigation s outcome 
management continues to believe that the resolution of these lawsuits or claims will not have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
the company cannot predict at this time the effect that any current or future regulatory activity  investigations or litigation will have on its business 
given the current regulatory environment and the number of its subsidiaries operating in local markets throughout the country  it is possible that the company will become subject to further governmental inquiries and subpoenas and have lawsuits filed against it 
the company s ultimate liability  if any  in connection with these matters and any possible future such matters is uncertain and subject to contingencies that are not yet known

table of contents contingent consideration and contingent firm employee payments in order to better determine the economic value of the businesses the company has acquired  the company has incorporated contingent consideration  or earnout  provisions into the structure of its acquisitions since the beginning of these arrangements generally provide for the payment of additional consideration to the sellers upon the firm s satisfaction of certain compounded growth rate thresholds over the three year period generally following the closing of the acquisition 
in a small number of cases  contingent consideration may also be payable after shorter periods 
as of december   acquisitions are within their initial three year contingent consideration measurement period 
for acquisitions effective prior to january   contingent consideration is considered to be additional purchase consideration and is accounted for as part of the purchase price of the company s acquired firms when the outcome of the contingency is determined beyond a reasonable doubt 
for acquisitions completed after january   in accordance with gaap  contingent consideration amounts are fair valued at the acquisition date and are included on that basis in reported purchase price consideration at the time of the acquisition with subsequent adjustments recorded in the statement of operations 
in connection with certain acquisitions  the company also has agreed to make certain contingent payments to employees of its acquired firms  contingent upon the satisfaction of established performance milestones 
these payments are expensed as employee compensation 
the minimum contingent payments which could be payable as purchase consideration and employee compensation in each year is zero 
the maximum contingent payment which could be payable as purchase consideration and employee compensation based on commitments outstanding as of december  consists of the following schedule of maximum contingent payments in thousands purchase consideration contingent consideration payable for acquisitions consummated in would generally be payable by the end of nfp currently anticipates using contingent consideration arrangements in future acquisitions  which would result in an increase in the maximum contingent consideration amount in and thereafter 
the maximum consideration is generally payable upon a firm achieving a compound annual growth rate of  or higher  in earnings during the first three years following acquisition 
the payments of purchase consideration are generally made in cash and nfp common stock based on the average closing price of nfp common stock for the trading days up to and including the end of the period  in proportions that vary among acquisitions 
contingent firm employee payments are generally payable in cash and recorded as an expense in the year earned

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding unrecognized tax positions 
segment information in june  the fasb issued guidance relating to disclosures about enterprise segments and related information 
this guidance established standards for the way companies report information about operating segments in financial statements 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
in accordance with gaap  the company has determined that it operates in a single segment within the financial services industry entirely within the united states of america  its territories and canada 
it is impracticable for the company to disclose the revenue from external customers for corporate and executive benefits  life insurance and wealth transfer and financial planning and investment advisory services  as the company does not have available discrete financial information for such specific products and services 
while as of the year ended december  the company did not manage its business based on specific revenue categories  management continually assesses the company s reporting processes and plans to develop a reporting infrastructure to accommodate more robust client  product and service level information 
critical accounting policies business acquisitions  purchase price allocations and intangible assets since the company s formation and through december   it has completed acquisition transactions  including sub acquisitions 
all of these transactions have been accounted for using the purchase method  and their related net assets and results of operations were included in nfp s consolidated financial statements commencing on their respective acquisition dates 
certain of the acquisitions have provisions for additional contingent consideration based upon the financial results achieved over a multi year period 
this additional consideration is reflected as an increase in goodwill when results are achieved and the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt 
the company allocates the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired to book of business  management contracts  institutional customer relationships  trade name and goodwill 
the company amortizes intangibles over a year period for book of business  a year period for management contracts and an year period for institutional customer relationships 

table of contents intangible assets are presented net of accumulated amortization and consist of the following as of december  in thousands book of business management contracts trade name institutional customer relationships goodwill total intangible assets and goodwill amortization expense consisted of the following for the years ended december  in thousands book of business management contracts trade name institutional customer relationships goodwill total amortization impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates its amortizing long lived assets and non amortizing intangible assets for impairment in accordance with gaap 
in accordance with gaap  long lived assets  such as purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company generally performs its recoverability test on a quarterly basis for each of its acquired firms that have experienced a significant deterioration in its business indicated principally by either an inability to produce base earnings for a period of time or in the event of a restructure in base 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and by the eventual disposition of the asset 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the underlying asset  an impairment may exist 
the company measures impairments on identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying amount of the asset 
in the event that the discounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment charge will be recognized for the difference in the consolidated statements of operations 
for the years ended december    and  the company recorded impairment losses of million  million  and million respectively  related to management contract and book of business  which is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
in accordance with gaap  goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested at least annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the intangible asset might be impaired 
the company generally performs its impairment test on a quarterly basis for each of its acquired firms that may have an indicator of impairment 
indicators at the company level include but are not limited to sustained operating losses or a trend of poor operating performance  which may cause the 
table of contents terms of the applicable management contract to be restructured  loss of key personnel  a decrease in nfp s market capitalization below its book value  and an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
indicators of impairment at the reporting unit level may be due to the failure of the firms the company acquires to perform as expected after the acquisition for various reasons  including legislative or regulatory changes that affect the products and services in which a firm specializes  the loss of key clients after acquisition  general economic factors that impact a firm in a direct way  and the death or disability of significant principals 
if one or more indicators of impairment exist  nfp performs an evaluation to identify potential impairments 
if an impairment is identified  nfp measures and records the amount of impairment loss 
a two step impairment test is performed on goodwill 
in the first step  nfp compares the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit 
nfp determines the fair value of its reporting units by blending two valuation approaches the income approach and a market value approach 
in order to determine the relative fair value of each of the reporting units the income approach is conducted first 
these relative values are then scaled to the estimated market value of nfp 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and nfp is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner that is consistent with the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
for the years ended december    and  the company recorded impairment losses of million  million  and million  respectively  related to goodwill and trade name  which is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations
