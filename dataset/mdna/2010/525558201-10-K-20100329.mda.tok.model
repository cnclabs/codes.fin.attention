item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k and in our other securities and exchange commission filings 
the following discussion may contain predictions  estimates  and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures  and markets medical devices and implants for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease 
our principal product offerings are sold throughout the world  primarily in the united states  the european union and  to a lesser extent  japan 
we estimate that the annual worldwide market addressed by our product lines approaches billion and that the annual worldwide market for all peripheral vascular devices approximates billion 
we have used acquisitions as a primary means of further accessing the larger peripheral vascular device market  and we expect to continue to pursue this strategy in the future 
we currently manufacture most of our product lines in our burlington  massachusetts  headquarters 
our products are used by vascular surgeons who treat peripheral vascular disease through both open surgical methods and more recently adopted endovascular techniques 
in contrast to interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists  neither of whom are certified to perform open surgical procedures  vascular surgeons can perform both open surgical and minimally invasive endovascular procedures  and are therefore uniquely positioned to provide patients with a wider range of treatment options 
below is a listing of our product lines and product categories our endovascular product category includes our taarget thoracic stent graft  unifit abdominal stent graft  vascutape radiopaque tape  leveredge contrast injector  and the unballoon non occlusive modeling catheter 
we also report the results of our distribution of the endologix powerlink system within this category 
our vascular product category includes our expandable lemaitre valvulotome  pruitt inahara and pruitt f carotid shunts  invisigrip vein stripper  lemaitre balloon catheters  and the five remote endarterectomy products  anastoclip vessel closure system  and the albograft vascular graft 
we also report the results of our distribution of the xenosure biologic vascular patch within this category 

table of contents our general surgery product category includes our reddick cholangiogram catheter and related accessories and optilock implantable port 
for the  and fiscal years  we reported the net sales of our anastoclip vessel closure system within the endovascular product category  and our discussion herein maintains this presentation 
commencing in we will report these net sales in the vascular category 
we evaluate the sales performance of our various product lines utilizing criteria that vary based upon the position of each product line in its expected life cycle 
for established products  we typically review unit sales and selling prices 
for faster growing products  we typically also focus upon new account generation and customer retention 
our business opportunities include the following the addition of complementary products through acquisition  the updating of existing products and introduction of new products through research and development  the long term growth of our sales force in north america  europe and japan  and the introduction of our products in new markets upon obtainment of regulatory approvals in these markets 
we are currently pursuing each of these opportunities 
to assist us in evaluating our business strategies  we regularly monitor long term technology trends in the peripheral vascular device market 
additionally  we consider the information obtained from discussions with the medical community in connection with the demand for our products  including potential new product launches 
we also use this information to help determine our competitive position in the peripheral vascular device market and our manufacturing capacity requirements 
we sell our products primarily through a direct sales force 
as of december   our sales force was comprised of sales representatives in north america  the european union and japan 
we also sell our products through a network of distributors in various countries outside of the united states and canada 
our worldwide headquarters are located in burlington  massachusetts 
our international operations are headquartered in sulzbach  germany 
we also have sales offices located in tokyo  japan  and rome  italy  and a manufacturing facility in brindisi  italy 
in  approximately of our net sales were generated in markets in which we employ direct sales representatives 
because we believe that direct to hospital sales engender closer customer relationships  and allow for higher selling prices and gross margins  we periodically enter into transactions with our distributors to transition their sales of our medical devices to our direct sales organization 
in march  we entered into a definitive agreement with edwards lifesciences to terminate its distribution of our albograft vascular graft 
we paid million to edward lifesciences in exchange for this early termination  the purchase of their albograft customer list  certain customer contracts and remaining albograft inventory  and their provision of sales and marketing services 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies  primarily the euro  affect our financial results 
for the year ended december   approximately of our sales were denominated in foreign currencies 
we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our sales in the future 
selling  marketing  and administrative costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currency  thereby partially mitigating our transaction risk exposure 
we therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is moderated 
however  most of our foreign sales are denominated in local currency  and if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of 
table of contents the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
our strategy for growing our business includes the acquisition of complementary product lines and companies and occasionally the discontinuance or divestiture of products or activities that are no longer complementary 
these actions may affect the comparability of our financial results from period to period and may cause substantial fluctuations period to period 
for example  in december we entered into an agreement with neovasc inc to distribute the xenosure biologic vascular patch 
we began selling this product in the following table indicates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and changes to our business activities for each of our quarters during the three most recently completed fiscal years amounts in thousands q q q q q q q q q q q q total net sales impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations net impact of acquisitions  distributed sales and discontinued products  excluding currency exchange rate fluctuations represents the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year based on the weighted average exchange rate for each quarter 
represents the impact of sales of products of acquired businesses and distributed sales of other manufacturers products  net of sales related to discontinued products and other activities  based on months sales following the date of the event or transaction  for the current period only 
in recent years we have experienced comparatively greater success in product markets characterized by low or limited competition 
in these markets  we believe that we have been able to increase selling prices without sacrificing material market share  to the benefit of our rate of net sales growth 
in contrast  we have experienced comparatively lesser success in highly competitive product markets such as aortic stent grafts  where we face intense competition from larger companies with greater resources 
for example  we believe that intense competition from medtronic  w 
l 
gore and cook has affected the adoption of our taarget thoracic stent graft in european markets 
while this latter trend may moderate as we continue to grow our organization  and while we believe that this trend can be mitigated by our strong relationships with our vascular surgeon customers  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the aortic stent graft market or in other highly competitive markets 
net sales and expense components the following is a description of the primary components of our net sales and expenses net sales 
we derive our net sales from the sale of our products  less discounts and returns 
most of our sales are generated by our direct sales force and are shipped and billed to hospitals or clinics throughout the world 
in countries where we do not have a direct sales force  sales are primarily generated by shipments to distributors who  in turn  sell to hospitals and clinics 
in those cases where our products are held on consignment at a hospital or clinic  we generate sales at the time the product is used in surgery rather than at shipment 
cost of sales 
we manufacture nearly all of the products that we sell 
our cost of sales consists primarily of manufacturing personnel  raw materials and components  depreciation of property and equipment  and other allocated manufacturing overhead  as well as freight expense we pay to ship products to customers 

table of contents sales and marketing 
our selling and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries  commissions  stock based compensation  travel and entertainment  attendance at medical society meetings  training programs  advertising and product promotions  direct mail  and other marketing costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of executive  finance and human resource expense  stock based compensation  legal and accounting fees  information technology expense  intangible amortization expense  and insurance expense 
research and development 
research and development expense includes costs associated with the design  development  testing  enhancement  and regulatory approval of our products 
it also includes costs associated with design and execution of clinical studies and regulatory submissions and costs to register  maintain  and defend our intellectual property 
restructuring 
restructuring expense includes costs directly associated with distribution agreement termination expenses  severance  and retention costs for terminated employees  and other expenses associated with restructuring our operations 
other income expense 
other income expense primarily includes interest income and expense  investment impairment charges  foreign currency gains losses  and other miscellaneous gains losses 
income tax expense 
we are subject to federal and state income taxes for earnings generated in the us  which include operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for certain years depending on tax elections made  and foreign taxes on earnings of our wholly owned german  french  italian  and japanese subsidiaries 
our consolidated tax expense is affected by the mix of our taxable income loss in the united states  germany  france  italy  and japan  permanent items  discrete items  unrecognized tax benefits  and amortization of goodwill for u 
s tax reporting purposes 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december   to the year ended december  the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations and the change between the specified periods expressed as a percent increase or decrease percent change in thousands net sales net sales by product category endovascular vascular general surgery total branded products oem total net sales by geography americas international total 
table of contents net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in sales in our vascular product category grew  while sales in our endovascular product category and general surgery product categories decreased by and  respectively  from the previous year 
new acquisitions and business development activities added to year over year sales growth while changes in foreign currency exchange rates subtracted 
excluding these effects  net sales for grew 
sales increases in were largely driven by higher average selling prices across nearly all product lines  as well as an increase in our vascular product category of million which included additional xenosure biologic vascular patch sales of million  increased valvulotomes sales of million and vascular catheter sales of million  as well as increases in all other product lines in the vascular product category 
these gains were partially offset by a million decrease in our endovascular product category  primarily due to decreased taarget thoracic stent graft  endologix powerlink system  and anastoclip vessel closure system sales  as well as the effect of negative currency exchange rate fluctuations of million 
in the volatility of the euro as compared to the dollar significantly affected the value of our sales in europe when translated into us dollars 
this affect may continue into our endovascular product category declined to of net sales in from in the prior year 
our endovascular product category represented of our revenues for the three months ending december  endovascular declines were driven in part by decreased sales from our taarget thoracic and endologix powerlink stent graft offerings 
taarget stent graft results were due mainly to the retirement of our largest stent graft customer in the fourth quarter of  as well as strong competitor product offerings 
we expect that our endovascular product category will continue to decrease as a percentage of our revenues in  in part due to the loss of this key customer 
direct to hospital net sales were in  up from in the increase was largely due to strong results from our comparatively newer sales organizations in italy and france and the termination of edwards lifesciences distribution of our albograft vascular graft 
net sales by geography 
net sales in the americas increased million to million in the increase was mainly the result of higher average selling prices across nearly all product lines as well as the addition of million of sales of the xenosure biologic vascular patch 
international net sales decreased million in to million 
international sales were favorably impacted by sales growth of million at our italian sales office  million at our french sales office  and million at our japanese sales office 
international sales were unfavorably impacted by the effect of negative currency exchange rate fluctuations of million and by a decrease in sales of our endovascular product category of million

gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in while our gross margin increased to 
the gross margin increase was largely the result of improved manufacturing efficiencies  higher average selling prices across nearly all product lines  a reduction in inventory write downs related to the redesign of our taarget thoracic stent graft product line in  and our

sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense decreased to million in  from million in selling expense decreased million while marketing expense decreased million 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced sales and marketing expense by million compared to the prior year 
selling expense decreases were driven largely by reduced sales commissions and payroll costs of million  decreased travel and entertainment expenses of million  and the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
marketing expense decreases were largely the result of reduced advertising expenses of million  reduced advisory board expenses of million  and the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations  and were partially offset by additional payroll costs of million 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expense decreased to in from in the prior year 
at the end of  we employed field sales representatives worldwide  as compared to at the end of selling expense was restrained in part by the adoption of a lower cost compensation model for most new sales hires  and we expect to continue this hiring practice in general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in insurance premiums of million and was partially offset by increased amortization of million related to the termination of our albograft vascular graft distribution agreement 
research and development 
research and development expense increased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expense increased to in compared to in the increase was driven by increased regulatory and clinical affairs related costs of million as well as higher product development expense of million  and was partially offset by a reduction in royalty expense of million  driven by reduced taarget thoracic stent graft and unifit abdominal stent graft sales  and in processing engineering expense of million 
we had enrolled patients in our unite clinical trial as of december  compared to as of december  we anticipate that research and development expense will increase over time as more unite and entrust trial patients are enrolled  new products follow the regulatory pathways  and more product development is undertaken 
restructuring 
restructuring charges increased to million in from million in in  we incurred a million restructuring charge related to the march  termination of our albograft vascular graft distribution agreement with edwards lifesciences 
the transaction included the payment of million in exchange for the termination of the distribution agreement  as well as the acquisition of detailed customer information  transition services  and remaining product inventory 
charges included million related to the early termination of our distributor in italy  and million related to our reductions in force in february and july 

table of contents impairment charges 
we incurred million of impairment charges in related to patents deemed to have no value based on future expected economic benefits 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in the charge was the result of the write down of intangible assets totaling million relating to a customer relationship at our biomateriali subsidiary  as well as the write down of selected patents of million 
other income expense 
in  net interest income was  compared to million in the decrease was a result of an unfavorable interest rate market and the allocation of our portfolio to low risk investments 
foreign exchange gains for were million compared to foreign exchange losses of million in foreign exchange gains are due to the comparative weakening of the dollar versus the euro during the financial period 
other income expense for was primarily due to losses on the disposal of capital equipment of  in  we recognized the write down of portfolio investments totaling million which was attributed to the other than temporary decline in one specific asset backed security which we held as available for sale in our marketable securities portfolio income tax expense 
we recorded a provision for taxes of million in compared to million in on pre tax income of million in and on a pre tax loss of million in the provision was comprised of taxes on profits on certain of our foreign subsidiaries that are profitable  deferred tax liabilities related to the amortization of goodwill for us tax purposes which cannot be used to reduce existing deferred tax assets  and the alternative minimum tax 
our effective tax rate differed from the us statutory tax rate principally due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies 
in  we utilized million of our u 
s net operating loss carryforwards 
during  we could utilize the remaining million of u 
s net operating loss carryforwards  which may result in an increased provision for taxes on a prospective basis 
we provide a full valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets  as we believe it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and deferred taxes will not be realized 
however  it is possible that the realization of future profits could result in the reversal of a significant portion  or all of the valuation allowance  which would then be recorded as a tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations in the period of reversal

new acquisitions and business development activities added to year over year sales growth  changes in foreign currency exchange rates added and organic sales increased 
sales increases were driven in part by the inclusion of our acquisitions excluding the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations of approximately million  higher average selling prices  the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations of approximately million  and significant sales growth in various international markets  including the united kingdom  japan and france  and were partially offset by a decline in unit sales in several of our product lines

net sales by geography 
net sales in the united states and canada increased to million in  as compared to million in the increase was driven primarily by the full year inclusion of our acquisitions of the leveredge contrast injector  aspire stent  and endore product lines  as well as higher average selling prices and strong results from our valvulotome and embolectomy catheter product lines

research and development 
research and development expense increased to million in from million in the increase was driven by increases in regulatory and clinical expense and personnel costs  the inclusion of biomateriali in the consolidated results  increased royalties of million  higher product development costs largely related to the introduction of the tt delivery system  and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of million 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in process development costs 
restructuring 
restructuring charges increased to million in from million in charges included million related to the early termination of our distributor in italy  and million related to our reductions in force in february and july 
expenses for included charges related to the buy out of our distributors in ireland and italy due to our decision to sell directly to hospitals in those countries 
purchased research and development 
in conjunction with a technology acquisition in december  we acquired in process research and development with a fair value of million that was expensed on the date of acquisition  as the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use to us at the date of acquisition 
impairment charges 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in the charge was the result of the write down of intangible assets totaling million relating to a customer relationship at our biomateriali subsidiary  as well as the write down of selected patents of million 
other income expense 
in interest income was million compared to million in the change was due to a decrease in average cash on hand throughout the year  significantly reduced yields on portfolio investments  the write down of portfolio investments of million which was attributed to the other than temporary decline in one specific asset backed security which we held as available for sale in our marketable securities portfolio at december   and increased interest expense associated with acquisition related debt at our biomateriali subsidiary of million 
losses on foreign currency exchange were due to a relative decrease in the strength of the euro as compared to the us dollar 
other income expense for was primarily due to losses on the disposal of capital equipment of  income tax expense 
we recorded a provision for taxes of million in compared to million in despite pre tax losses of million in and million in the provision was the result of a number of factors  including taxes on profits on certain of our foreign subsidiaries that are profitable  deferred tax liabilities related to the amortization of goodwill for us tax purposes  which cannot be used to reduce existing deferred tax assets  and effects of changes in uncertain tax positions 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million as compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments 
table of contents with maturities of days or less at the date of purchase and consist of time deposits  fully collateralized overnight repurchase agreements  and us government obligations  and are stated at cost  which approximates fair value 
our marketable securities are primarily marketable debt securities  corporate bonds  and us government securities that we classify as available for sale and are carried at fair market value 
we did not hold any mortgage asset backed or auction rate securities in our investment portfolio as of december  the majority of our marketable securities have remaining maturities of two years or less 
the weighted average maturity of the portfolio was months as of december   a reduction of months from december  as of december   our investment portfolio included million of asset backed securities collateralized by credit card debt  and auto loans 
in order to limit our credit risk exposure  we reduced our asset backed securities holdings in by million  from million as of december  in the event of a temporary decline in market value  we have the intent and ability to hold our debt investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested 
we continually monitor the asset allocation of our holdings in an attempt to mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures  and we intend to continue to closely monitor developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as necessary 
although the volatility in the current global financial markets can affect the liquidity and valuation of selected securities  we do not anticipate that these events will result in significant portfolio liquidity limitations or write downs  although we can make no assurances to this effect 
operating and capital expenditure requirements we require cash to pay our operating expenses  make capital expenditures  and pay our long term liabilities 
since our inception  we have funded our operations through private and public placements of equity securities  short term borrowings  and funds generated from our operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized operating income of million  net of a million restructuring charge 
although it is our intention to generate an operating profit on an ongoing basis  excluding the impact of acquisitions and distributor terminations  there can be no assurance that we will generate an operating profit in the future due to our continued investment in growing our business 
we expect to fund any increased costs and expenditures from our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  though our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the revenues generated by sales of our products  the costs associated with expanding our manufacturing  marketing  sales  and distribution efforts  the earn out payments due related to the unballoon non occlusive modeling catheter  the rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities  litigation  the costs of obtaining and maintaining fda and other regulatory clearances of our products and products in development  the effects of competing technological and market developments  and the number  timing  and nature of acquisitions and other strategic transactions 
our cash balances may decrease as we continue to use cash to fund our operations  make acquisitions  make purchases under our share repurchase program  and make deferred payments related to prior acquisitions 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  investments and the interest we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
if these sources of cash are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements beyond the next months  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or borrow against our credit facility 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in 
table of contents dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities  such securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back  or eliminate some or all of our business operations or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
credit facility we have a revolving line of credit with brown brothers harriman co under which our borrowing capacity is million  with a maximum principal amount of any letters of credit issued as part of this facility of million 
in august  the maturity date for amounts borrowed was extended to august loans made under this revolving line of credit bear interest at libor plus basis points or the bank s base rate  at our discretion 
borrowings under this line of credit are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
as of december   we had no borrowing outstanding under this line of credit 
the loan agreement requires that we meet certain financial and operating covenants including a required leverage ratio and minimum tangible net worth 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants

net cash used from changes in operating assets and liabilities was million 
the net cash used from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily a result of the payment of restructuring related liabilities and an overall decrease in operating expense spending in  offset by reduced levels inventory of million 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in this was primarily due to sales and maturities of marketable securities of million  the purchase of technology and other intangible assets of million  payments made related to prior year acquisitions of million  and purchases of property and equipment of million

the net proceeds from the sale and maturities of marketable securities of million were reinvested into cash equivalents such as time deposits and fully collateralized overnight repurchase agreements 
in december  we purchased certain patent applications and in process research and development which included earn out payments associated with the commercialization of the device in the european union and the united states as part of the consideration 
the earn out payments are payable quarterly at approximately the rate of two times sales for the four quarters 
the european earn out period is measured from december  through december  we recorded an intangible asset and a liability of approximately  related to the sales volume 
the united states earn out period is measured over four quarters following the first commercial sale in the united states 
we anticipate that the payment of resulting future earn out obligations may impact cash flow from investing activities in financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in this was primarily due to the purchase of million of treasury stock under our stock repurchase plan and the purchase of million of treasury stock to cover withholding taxes of restricted stock award vesting s and was partially offset by million from the exercise of stock options and million from an italian government loan program which we assumed as part of our purchase of biomateriali 
we may purchase an additional million of treasury stock under our stock repurchase plan through december  net cash used in financing activities was  in this was primarily due to the repayment of the revolving line of credit at our italian subsidiary of million  and offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of common stock options and our employee purchase plan of million 
contractual obligations 
our principal contractual obligations consist of operating leases  inventory purchase commitments  and income tax obligations for unrecognized tax benefits 
the following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations total less than year years years in thousands operating leases purchase commitments for inventory unrecognized tax benefits total contractual obligations the commitments under our operating leases consist primarily of lease payments for our burlington  massachusetts  corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility and a separate manufacturing and storage facility in burlington  massachusetts  each expiring in  our sulzbach  germany office  expiring in  and our tokyo  japan office  expiring in on march   we extended our lease of our manufacturing facility in burlington  massachusetts through additionally  we entered into a lease for an additional  square feet in an adjacent facility in burlington  massachusetts through while terminating the lease to our burlington storage facility 
the purchase commitments for inventory are to be used in operations over the normal course of business and do not represent excess commitments or loss contracts 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  sales returns and discounts  and income taxes are reviewed on an ongoing basis and updated as appropriate 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the industry  and information provided by physicians who use our products and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial estimates and related accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements 
those financial estimates and related policies include revenue recognition our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of disposable or implantable devices used during vascular surgery 
we sell directly to hospitals and to distributors  as described below  and  during the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements  entered into consigned inventory arrangements with either hospitals or distributors on a limited basis 
we recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generally use customer purchase orders or contracts to determine the existence of an arrangement 
substantially all sales transactions are based on prices that are determinable at the time that the customer s purchase order is accepted by us 
in order to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we would defer the recognition of revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we provide for product returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our historical return product history 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable are with customers based in the united states and internationally 
accounts receivable generally are due within to days of invoice and are stated at amounts due from customers  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  other than in certain european markets where longer payment terms are customary 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the current creditworthiness of the customers  as 
table of contents determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor aging reports  collections  and payments from customers  and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues we identify 
we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and allowances  we cannot guarantee the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
the provision for the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in general and administrative expenses 
inventory inventory consists of finished products  work in process  and raw materials 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
cost includes materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead and is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and our estimated sales forecast  which is based on sales history and anticipated future demand 
our estimates of future product demand may not be accurate  and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
accordingly  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations 
stock based compensation we recognize  as expense  the estimated fair value of all share based payments to employees which is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
we have elected to recognize the compensation cost of all share based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
in periods that we grant stock options  fair value assumptions are based on volatility  interest  dividend yield  and expected term over which the stock options will be outstanding 
the computation of expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury risk free interest rate in effect at the time of grant 
the expected lives of the options were estimated using the simplified method for plan vanilla options 
computation of expected forfeitures is based on historical forfeiture rates of our stock options 
we used an expected forfeiture rate of approximately   and for  and  respectively 
share based compensation charges are recorded net of the estimated forfeitures and will be adjusted in future periods to reflect the results of actual forfeitures and vesting 
as disclosed more fully in the notes of our financial statements  we recorded expense of approximately million in connection with share based payment awards for the year ended december  the future expense of non vested share based awards of approximately million is to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
during  we granted stock options at a weighted average exercise price of and restricted stock units with fair value weighted average price of 
valuation of goodwill  other intangibles when we acquire a business  the purchase price is allocated  as applicable  among acquired tangible net assets  identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill as required by us gaap 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of the acquired businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists 
we evaluate the december balance of the carrying value of goodwill based on a single reporting unit 
the first step of our goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and thus the second 
table of contents step of the impairment test  used to measure the amount of the impairment loss  is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill as of the date of the impairment review with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of our goodwill is determined on the same basis as the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with a business combination 
specifically  we allocate the fair value of our reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination as of the date of the impairment review and as if the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we have determined that no impairment charges were required during the year ended december  as the market capitalization of the company as a whole has exceeded the carrying amount  and on that basis we concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
goodwill was million as of december  and our annual impairment testing indicated no significant risk of impairment based upon changes in value that are reasonably likely to occur 
however  changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of our reporting unit 
other intangible assets consist primarily of purchased developed technology  patents  customer relationships  and trademarks and are amortized over their estimated useful lives  ranging from two to years 
we review intangible assets quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist for a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment 
conditions that may indicate impairment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of the asset  a change in the operating cash flows associated with the asset  or adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset  we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified 
we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets  we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions  cost structures  and remaining useful lives of the asset 
these estimates and assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million as of december   and million as of december  we recognized impairment charges on our intangible assets of million in and million in contingencies in the normal course of business  we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  and other claims and assessments for matters related to  among other things  patent infringement  business acquisitions  employment  and product recalls 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
we record charges for the costs we anticipate incurring in connection with litigation and claims against us when we determine a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate these costs 
during the years ended december    and  we were not subject to any material litigation  claims or assessments 
restructuring we record restructuring charges incurred in connection with consolidation or relocation of operations  exited business lines  or shutdowns of specific sites 
these restructuring charges  which reflect our commitment 
table of contents to a termination or exit plan that will begin within twelve months  are based on estimates of the expected costs associated with site closure  legal matters  contract terminations  or other costs directly related to the restructuring 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  an additional charge to earnings will result 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a credit to earnings will be recognized 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from taxable income during the carryback period or in the future  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect this increase as an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
we do not provide for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  as our current intention is to permanently reinvest these earnings 
we recognize  measure  present and disclose in our financial statements  uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expects to take on a tax return 
we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions  both within the united states and outside of the united states and may be subject to audits from various tax authorities regarding transfer pricing  the deductibility of certain expenses  intercompany transactions  and other matters 
within specific countries  we may be subject to audit by various tax authorities operating within the country and may be subject to different statutes of limitation expiration dates 
management s judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  liabilities for uncertain tax positions  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
we have recorded a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of million in and million in marketable securities our investments consist primarily of marketable debt securities and us government securities  and are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair market value at december  the unrealized gains losses on available for sale securities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of days or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents  and investments with maturities of greater than days at the time of purchase to be short term investments 
when a marketable security incurs a significant unrealized loss for a sustained period of time  we review the instrument to determine if it is other than temporarily impaired 
if we conclude an instrument is other than temporarily impaired  we record the unrealized loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships
