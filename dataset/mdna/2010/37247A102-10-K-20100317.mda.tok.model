for example  congress currently has under discussion a number of healthcare reform measures  some of which include reimbursement changes to home health and hospice that can  if enacted  negatively impact gentiva and other providers 
the legislative environment is presently very fluid  and the company is monitoring the situation closely 

table of contents the commercial insurance industry is continually seeking ways to control the cost of services to patients that it covers

all prior year presentations have been reclassified to conform to the current year s format 
the principal changes that were adopted in fiscal are classification of the hme and iv businesses as discontinued operations  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  changes in segment information  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  and a reclassification which reduced hospice net revenues and cost of services sold by million in fiscal and million in fiscal relating to the reimbursement of nursing home room and board charges for hospice patients

episodic revenue growth  excluding the impact of acquisitions  was approximately percent for fiscal as compared to fiscal and was driven by increases in the company s specialty programs 
medicare revenues for fiscal were minimally impacted by an update to the market basket index of percent  substantially offset by a percent reduction in rates to offset coding changes since the original implementation of pps 
the number of episodes per admission approximated in both fiscal and revenues generated from medicare were million during fiscal  an increase of percent as compared to million in fiscal medicare revenues represented approximately percent of total home health revenues in the fiscal year as compared to percent of total home health revenues in the fiscal year

approximately percentage points of this increase is attributable to the fact that fiscal no longer included the impact of the lower margin carecentrix business 
from a total company perspective  the remaining increases in gross profit percentage were attributable primarily to i significant changes in revenue mix  ii an ongoing initiative to change the pay structure of home health clinicians from a salaried basis to a pay per visit basis which allows the company to better match revenues with expenses  and iii improved processes and management over various components of cost of services sold  such as mileage expenses  productive materials and workers compensation and professional and general liability costs 
these increases in gross margin percentage were partially offset by the impact of incremental costs resulting from i an increase in visits per episode of nearly percent  ii a change in the mix of clinician visits with a greater emphasis on higher cost disciplines and iii a significant increase in employee health and welfare costs 
the changes in revenue mix in the home health segment resulted from i organic revenue growth in medicare  particularly in the company s specialty programs  and the non medicare pps business  and ii the elimination or reduction of certain low margin medicaid and local government business and commercial business  including pediatric and adult hourly services and other business in home health branch offices that were sold in the first quarter of as a result of these factors  gross profit as a percentage of net revenues in the home health segment increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal hospice gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal  primarily as a result of improved management of productive labor costs and direct materials  including drug expenses

as a result of the disposition of carecentrix  the company s net revenues associated with capitated arrangements are immaterial for fiscal medicare settlement issues under interim payment system prior to october   reimbursement of medicare home healthcare services was based on reasonable  allowable costs incurred in providing services to eligible beneficiaries subject to both per visit and per beneficiary limits in accordance with the interim payment system established through the balanced budget act of these costs were reported in annual cost reports which were filed with the centers for medicare medicaid services cms and were subject to audit by the fiscal intermediary engaged by cms 
the fiscal intermediary has not finalized its audit of the fiscal cost reports 
furthermore  settled cost reports relating to certain years prior to fiscal could be subject to reopening of the audit process by the fiscal intermediary 
although management believes that established reserves related to the open fiscal cost report year are sufficient  it is possible that adjustments resulting from such audits could exceed established reserves and could have a material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these reserves are reflected in medicare liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company periodically reviews its established audit reserves for appropriateness and records any adjustments or settlements as net revenues in the company s consolidated statements of income 
there have not been any material revisions in established reserves for the periods presented in this filing 
settlement liabilities are recorded at the time of any probable and reasonably estimable event and any positive settlements are recorded as revenue in the company s consolidated statements of income in the period in which such gain contingencies are realized 
causes and impact of change on revenue for each of the sources of revenue  the principal elements in addition to those described above which can cause change in the amount of revenue to be realized are i an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation  ii an inability to obtain authorizations acceptable to the payer  iii utilization of services at levels other than authorized  and iv other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
revenue adjustments resulting from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts are recorded as adjustments to net revenues or recorded against allowance for doubtful accounts  depending on the nature of the adjustment 
these are determined by company management and reviewed from time to time  but no less often than quarterly 
each of the elements described here and under each of the various sources of revenue can effect change in the estimates  and it is not possible to predict the degree of change that might be effected by a variation in one or more of the elements described 
while it is not possible to predict the degree of change of each element  we believe that changes in these elements could cause a change in estimate which could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
there have not been any material revisions in these estimates for the periods presented in this filing

the company reviews each account individually and does not have either a threshold dollar amount or aging period that it uses to trigger a balance write off  although the company does have a small balance write off policy for non governmental accounts with debit balances under the company s policy is to bill for patient co payments and make good faith efforts to collect such amounts 
at the end of each reporting period  the company estimates the amount of outstanding patient co payments that will not be collected and the amount of outstanding co payments that may be waived due to financial hardship based on a review of historical trends

the company analyzes historical collection trends  reimbursement experience and revenue adjustment trends by major payers including medicare and other payers as well as by business lines  as an integral part of the estimation process related to determining the valuation allowance for accounts receivable 
in addition  the company assesses the current state of its billing functions on a quarterly basis in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues to determine the impact  if any  on its reserve estimates  which involve judgment 
revisions in reserve estimates are recorded as an adjustment to the provision for doubtful accounts  which is reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses for continuing operations and in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income 
the provision for doubtful accounts relating to continuing operations and discontinued operations amounted to million and million  respectively  in fiscal  million and million  respectively  in fiscal and million and million  respectively in fiscal the allowance for doubtful accounts at january   december  and december  was million  million and million  respectively
