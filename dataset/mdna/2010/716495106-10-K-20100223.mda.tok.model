item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our results of operations and our current financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration  development and production of predominately natural gas properties located onshore in the united states 
our business is comprised of an oil and natural gas segment and a midstream segment 
our oil and natural gas properties are concentrated in four premier domestic shale plays that we believe have decades of future development potential 
we organize our oil and natural gas operations into two principal regions the mid continent  which includes our louisiana  arkansas and east texas properties  and the western  which includes our south texas and oklahoma properties 
our midstream segment consists of our gathering subsidiary  hawk field services which was formed 
table of contents 
index to financial statements to create shareholder value by integrating our active drilling program with activities of third parties and developing additional gathering and treating capacity serving the haynesville shale and bossier shale in north louisiana  the fayetteville shale in arkansas and the eagle ford shale in south texas 
historically  we have grown through acquisitions of proved reserves and undeveloped acreage  with a focus on properties within our core operating areas which we believe have significant development and exploration opportunities and where we can apply our technical experience and economies of scale to increase production and proved reserves while lowering lease operating costs 
beginning in and continuing in  we have significantly expanded our leasehold position in natural gas shale plays  particularly in the haynesville shale play in northern louisiana and east texas and the eagle ford shale play in south texas 
the vast majority of our acreage in these plays is currently undeveloped 
typically  the leases we own require that production in paying quantities be established on units under the lease within the lease term generally three to five years or the lease will expire  although a significant percentage of the leases in the haynesville shale play are currently held by production from other producing zones 
lease expirations are expected to be an important factor determining our capital expenditures focus over the next two years 
at december   our estimated total proved oil and natural gas reserves  as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firm  netherland  sewell  were approximately  bcfe  consisting of mmbbls of oil  and  bcf of natural gas and natural gas liquids 
approximately of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed 
we maintain operational control of approximately of our proved reserves 
production for the fourth quarter of averaged mmcfe d 
full year production averaged mmcfe d compared to mmcfe d in our total operating revenues for were approximately billion 
our financial results depend upon many factors  but are largely driven by the volume of our oil and natural gas production and the price that we receive for that production 
our production volumes will decline as reserves are depleted unless we expend capital in successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties with existing production 
the amount we realize for our production depends predominantly upon commodity prices  which are affected by changes in market demand and supply  as impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors  and secondarily upon our commodity price hedging activities 
accordingly  finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs is critical to our long term success 
our capital budget is focused on the development of non proved reserve locations in our haynesville  bossier  eagle ford and fayetteville shale plays so that we can hold our acreage in these areas 
we also believe these projects offer us the potential for high internal rates of return and reserve growth 
currently we plan to spend approximately billion on drilling and completions during  of which million has been allocated to our haynesville and bossier shale properties  million to our eagle ford shale properties  million to our fayetteville shale properties and million to our remaining properties 
our midstream segment will have an estimated capital program of million 
additionally  we expect to spend between million and million on ongoing leasing activities 
our future drilling plans are subject to change based upon various factors  some of which are beyond our control  including drilling results  oil and natural gas prices  the availability and cost of capital  drilling and production costs  availability of drilling services and equipment  gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals 
to the extent these factors lead to reductions in our drilling plans and associated capital budgets in future periods  our financial position  cash flows and operating results could be adversely impacted 
one consequence of low natural gas prices is the possibility that we may be required to recognize non cash impairment expense under the full cost method of accounting  which we use to account for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities 
we recorded full cost ceiling impairments before income taxes of approximately billion and billion at march  and december   respectively  primarily due to the decrease in the henry hub spot market price to from per million british thermal units mmbtu 
at december   our net book value of oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling amount based 
table of contents 
index to financial statements on the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of each month for the month period ended december  using a wti posted price of per barrel and a henry hub price of per mmbtu 
as a result  we recorded a full cost ceiling impairment before income taxes of approximately million and million after taxes 
changes in prices  production rates  levels of reserves  future development costs  and other factors will determine our actual ceiling test calculation and impairment analyses in future periods 
on october   we closed the previously announced sale of our permian basin properties for million in cash  before customary closing adjustments 
proceeds from the sale were recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of our full cost pool 
in conjunction with the closing of this sale  we deposited the remaining net proceeds of million with a qualified intermediary to facilitate potential like kind exchange transactions million was previously received as a deposit 
as of december   million remained with the intermediary 
during the third quarter of  we announced our intent to further enhance our liquidity position by identifying potential asset dispositions for  which may include a transaction involving our midstream assets  divesting terryville field in northwest louisiana  divesting our interest in the west edmond hunton lime unit in central oklahoma as well as other non core assets 
capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of capital resources and liquidity are internally generated cash flows from operations  availability under our senior credit agreement  asset dispositions  and access to capital markets  to the extent available 
the capital markets have been adversely impacted by the continued financial crisis and concerns about the economic recession 
volatility in the capital markets could adversely impact our access to capital  which could reduce our ability to execute our development and acquisition plans  our ability to replace our reserves and our production levels 
we continue to monitor our liquidity and the capital markets 
we continuously evaluate our development plans in light of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  our cash flows  capital resources and drilling success 
our future capital resources and liquidity depend  in part  on our success in developing our leasehold interests 
cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in our production and proven reserves  which is typical in the capital intensive oil and natural gas industry 
future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on our capital resources and our success in finding additional reserves 
during and  we raised billion of debt net of discounts and expenses and billion of equity capital net of discounts and expenses 
we expect to fund our future capital requirements through internally generated cash flows  borrowings under our senior credit agreement  which has a borrowing base of billion at december   potential asset dispositions in  and accessing the capital markets  if necessary 
our ability to utilize the full amount of our borrowing capacity is influenced by a variety of factors  including semi annual redeterminations of our borrowing base  which may also be redetermined periodically at the discretion of our lenders  and covenants under our senior credit agreement and our senior unsecured debt indentures 
additionally  the indentures governing our senior unsecured debt contain covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness  including borrowings under our senior credit agreement  unless we meet one of two alternative tests 
the first test applies to all indebtedness and requires that after giving effect to the incurrence of additional debt the ratio of our adjusted consolidated ebitda as defined in our indentures to our adjusted consolidated interest expense over the trailing four fiscal quarters will be at least to the second test applies only to borrowings under our senior credit agreement that do not meet the first test and it limits these borrowings to the greater of a fixed sum the most restrictive indenture limit being million and a percentage the most restrictive indenture limit being of our adjusted consolidated net tangible assets as defined in all of our indentures  which is determined using discounted future net revenues from proved natural gas and oil reserves as of the end of each year 
our borrowing base  ebitda and consolidated net tangible assets are significantly influenced by  among other things  oil and natural gas prices 
we strive to maintain financial flexibility while continuing our aggressive drilling plans and may access the capital markets to  among other 
table of contents 
index to financial statements things  maintain substantial borrowing capacity under our senior credit agreement  facilitate drilling on our large undeveloped acreage position and permit us to selectively expand our acreage position and infrastructure projects 
our ability to complete future debt and equity offerings is subject to market conditions 
our long term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including our level of production and commodity prices  as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas industry 
if oil and natural gas prices remain at their current levels for a prolonged period of time or if natural gas prices decline  our ability to fund our capital expenditures  reduce debt  meet our financial obligations and become profitable may be materially impacted 
cash flow our primary sources of cash in  and were from operating and financing activities 
proceeds from the sale of common stock  the issuance of new senior debt and cash received from operations were offset by repayments of our senior credit agreement and cash used in investing activities to fund our drilling program and acquisition activities  net of any divestiture activities 
operating cash flow fluctuations were substantially driven by changes in commodity prices and changes in our production volumes 
working capital was substantially influenced by these variables 
fluctuation in commodity prices and our overall cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our future capital expenditures 
prices for oil and natural gas have historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season  however  the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout recent years 
see results of operations below for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales 
years ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash operating activities 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices  production volumes and operating costs 
net cash provided by operating activities increased in primarily due to the increase in our average daily production volumes due to our recent drilling success in the haynesville  fayetteville and eagle ford shales  which was partially offset by a decrease in our average realized natural gas equivalent price compared to the same period in the prior year 
production for averaged mmcfe d compared to mmcfe d during our natural gas equivalent price decreased per mcfe to per mcfe from per mcfe in the prior year 
as a result of our capital budget program  we expect to continue to increase our production volumes throughout however  we are unable to predict future production levels or future commodity prices  and  therefore  we cannot predict future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash flows provided by operating activities increased in primarily due to our increase in average realized natural gas equivalent price  partially offset by a decrease in production volumes due to the sale of our gulf coast properties during the fourth quarter of net cash flows provided by operating activities increased in primarily due to our increase in production volumes primarily due to our merger with kcs in july  as well as our increase in our realized natural gas equivalent price
