with sales of  and more than  employees in over countries  we believe we are the sixth largest paint and coatings company in the world 
our strong global brands and leading technologies  together with our technical expertise and customer service  differentiate us from competition and allow us to grow and create value with customers in a wide variety of geographic and end use markets 
our fundamental business objective is to create long term value for our shareholders 
we will accomplish this by focusing on helping our customers succeed and through our investments in brands and technologies  expansion of our global presence  operational discipline  productivity improvement and prudent cost control  generation of strong cash flow  and optimizing our allocation of capital to maintain and grow the business  increase dividends  fund internal growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions  and repurchase shares

the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in the context of this overview 
general economic and industry wide factors general economic conditions appear to have stabilized from those experienced during the global recession that started in late the recovery in our industry has been slow and volumes are still below pre recession levels 
the us housing and construction markets have not fully recovered to historical levels 
however  certain markets grew  including asia and latin america 
the chemical industry s economic cycle has been volatile for most of the last decade 
in  we experienced a significant increase in raw material costs along with shortages of certain raw materials in the second half of the year 
we expect raw material costs to continue to rise throughout fiscal year despite the challenging economic conditions in fiscal year  we accomplished the following continued to invest in our brands and technologies  which enabled us to gain new business in all of our product lines 
acquired wattyl limited  an australian paint manufacturer that provides a strong brand portfolio in an excellent geography and further diversifies our overall sales mix 
additionally  the acquisition provides a supply chain to support our largest customer s entry into the australian market 
acquired a key manufacturing site in india 
increased our dividend for the nd consecutive year to per share 
reduced our outstanding shares by buying back  shares for  which more than offset the exercise of stock options 
in october  our board authorized the purchase of an additional  shares in the future 
continued our restructuring initiatives that started in  which have lowered our cost structure and further increased our operational efficiency 
made aggregate pension contributions of  to maintain appropriate funding levels 
business performance net sales in increased to  from  in  primarily due to new business  improved market conditions  particularly outside the us  favorable foreign currency exchange and customer price increases 
our net income increased by 
the majority of the increase was due to new business across all product lines  customer price increases  productivity improvements and tight control of expenses  which offset significantly higher raw material costs 
this increase also included lower restructuring charges and a net gain from the sale of certain assets  partially offset by wattyl acquisition fees 
our global presence remained strong and international sales accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales 
during the third quarter of  we initiated a comprehensive series of actions to lower our cost structure and further increase our operational efficiency 
we incurred total restructuring charges of  and per share after tax  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on restructuring 

table of contents during the year  we generated  in free cash flow net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends  and our total debt  including notes payable  increased by  which was due to the acquisition of wattyl see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
our liquidity position is strong  with  in cash and cash equivalents and  in unused committed bank credit facilities providing total committed liquidity of  at year end  compared to  at the end of we have enhanced our liquidity by increasing our main credit facility from  to  and extended the term from june  to december  earnings per share net income per share available to common stockholders diluted was for and for huarun redeemable stock had no effect in as we acquired the remaining shares in the fourth quarter of we accrued  or per common share basic and diluted  in for the huarun redeemable stock see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
the table below presents adjusted net income per common share diluted  which excludes i the non cash accrual related to huarun redeemable stock in the period  ii an after tax gain net of related restructuring charges on the sale of certain assets  partially offset by after tax wattyl acquisition fees  and iii after tax restructuring charges included in net income in the respective periods 
net income per common share diluted huarun redeemable stock accrual net gain on sale of certain assets acquisition fees restructuring charges adjusted net income per common share diluted adjusted net income per common share diluted is a non gaap financial measure 
management discloses this measure because we believe the measure may assist investors in comparing our results of operations in the respective periods without regard to the impact of the non cash accrual related to the huarun redeemable stock  the net gain and our recent restructuring activity 
this non gaap measure is provided to enhance investors overall understanding of our current financial performance and prospects for the future 
specifically  we believe the non gaap measure provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses  gains and losses on purchases or sales of assets and non cash charges  as the case may be  which may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook 
in addition  because we have historically reported certain non gaap results to investors  we believe the inclusion of this non gaap measure provides consistency in our presentation of financial information 
as the huarun redeemable stock was redeemed  acquisition accounting was applied 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further details regarding huarun redeemable stock  the sale of certain assets and the wattyl acquisition  and to note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further restructuring details

the  increase in trade accounts payable and other accrued liabilities is primarily due to an increase in purchases  improved days payables outstanding and the timing of vendor payments 
the  increase in income taxes payable is due to the timing of tax payments 
the  increase in accounts and notes receivable is due to higher sales levels and the timing of customer payments 
the  increase in inventories and other assets is primarily due to the timing of raw material purchases and improved sales volume 
the  decrease in other deferred liabilities is primarily due to discretionary pension plan payments 
during the period  we used cash on hand  cash provided by operations and  in proceeds from the sale of treasury stock to fund  of acquisitions net of disposal of assets   in share repurchases   in dividend payments and  in capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were  in  compared with  in we anticipate capital spending in to be approximately  the  of restricted cash is associated with cash collateralization of certain letters of credit

these include payments under our multi currency credit facilities  senior notes  industrial development bonds  employee benefit plans  non cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year  capital expenditures  commodity purchase commitments and telecommunication commitments 
some of our interest charges are variable and are assumed at current rates

table of contents we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to uncertain tax positions 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  gross unrecognized tax benefits of  as of october   have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the third quarter of  we issued  of unsecured  senior notes that mature on june  with a coupon rate of 
the public offering was made pursuant to a registration statement filed with the us securities and exchange commission 
we used the net proceeds of  to repay our commercial paper borrowings and a portion of our borrowings under our existing bank credit facilities 
in june  we entered into a  unsecured committed revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks expiring on june  the bank syndicate facility replaced our  day credit agreement that was due to mature in november and our  five year credit agreement that was due to mature in october  which were both terminated on june  during the fourth quarter of  the bank syndicate facility was expanded by  to a total facility size of  under this facility  we had  outstanding as of october  and october  subsequent to october   the maturity date of the bank syndicate facility was extended from june  to december  and the facility was expanded by  to a total facility size of  the bank syndicate facility is a backstop to our  us commercial paper program established in  under which we had zero outstanding as of october  and october  in connection with the bank syndicate facility  we entered into a bilateral us dollar equivalent  unsecured committed revolving credit facility that expires on june  under which we had notes to banks totaling  and  at october  and october   respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a three year bilateral us dollar equivalent  unsecured committed revolving credit facility  under which  was outstanding as of october  the credit facilities contain covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of october  our debt covenants do not limit  nor are they reasonably likely to limit  our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
to ensure availability of funds  we maintain uncommitted bank lines of credit sufficient to cover outstanding short term borrowings 
these arrangements are reviewed periodically for renewal and modification 
outstanding borrowings under these debt arrangements were  and  as of october  and october   respectively 
at october   we had unused lines of committed and uncommitted credit available from banks of  we believe cash flow from operations  existing lines of credit  access to credit facilities and access to debt and capital markets will be sufficient to meet our current and projected needs for financing 
in the current market conditions  and through the recent credit crisis  we have demonstrated continued access to these markets 
we have committed liquidity and cash reserves in excess of our anticipated funding requirements 
our cash and cash equivalent balances consist of high quality short term money market instruments and cash held by our international subsidiaries that are used to fund day to day operating needs 
those balances have also been used to finance acquisitions 
our investment policy on excess cash is to preserve principal 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage well defined interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks 
we evaluate the financial stability of each counterparty and spread the risk among many financial institutions to limit our exposure 
we will continue to monitor counterparty risk on an ongoing basis 
we do not have any credit risk related contingent features in our derivative contracts as of october  common stock dividends of  in represented a increase over the dividend in was increased to per share from per share in we have continuing authorization to purchase shares of our common stock at management s discretion for general corporate purposes 
we repurchased  shares totaling  in compared to  shares totaling  in and  shares totaling  in we are involved in various claims relating to environmental and waste disposal matters at a number of current and former plant sites 
we engage or participate in remedial and other environmental compliance activities at certain of these sites 
at other sites  we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp under federal and state environmental laws for the remediation of hazardous waste 
management analyzes each individual site  considering the number of parties involved  the level of potential liability or contribution by us relative to the other parties  the nature and magnitude of the wastes involved  the method and extent of remediation  the potential insurance coverage  the estimated legal and consulting expense with respect to each site  and the time period over which any costs would likely be incurred 
based on the above analysis  management estimates the remediation or other clean up costs and related claims for each site 
the estimates are based in part on discussions with other prps  governmental agencies and engineering firms 

table of contents we accrue appropriate reserves for potential environmental liabilities  which are continually reviewed and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
while uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of our ultimate environmental liabilities  management believes there is not a reasonable possibility that such liabilities  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we are involved in a variety of legal claims and proceedings relating to personal injury  product liability  warranties  customer contracts  employment  trade practices  environmental and other legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
these claims and proceedings include cases where we are one of a number of defendants in proceedings alleging that the plaintiffs suffered injuries or contracted diseases from exposure to chemicals or other ingredients used in the production of some of our products or waste disposal 
we believe these claims and proceedings are not out of the ordinary course for a business of the type and size in which we are engaged 
while we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these claims and proceedings  management believes there is not a reasonable possibility that the costs and liabilities of such matters  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and that the judgments and estimates are reasonable revenue recognition other than extended furniture protection plans  revenue from sales is recognized at the time of product delivery  passage of title  a sales agreement is in place  pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
discounts provided to customers at the point of sale are recognized as a reduction in revenue as the products are sold 
we sell extended furniture protection plans for which revenue is deferred and recognized over the life of the contract 
an actuarial study utilizing historical claims data is used to forecast claim payments over the contract period  and revenue is recognized based on the forecasted claims payments 
actual claims costs are reflected in earnings in the period incurred 
anticipated losses on programs in progress are charged to earnings when identified 
supplier and customer rebates in accordance with underlying agreements  as they are earned  we estimate and record supplier and customer rebates as a reduction of cost of goods sold or a reduction to revenue  respectively 
the customer rebate estimate is developed based on historical experience plus current activity for the customer s purchases 
customer rebates that increase based on different levels of sales volume are recognized immediately when the current activity plus expected volume triggers a higher earned rebate 
the supplier rebate estimate is developed based on contractual terms of our current purchasing activity 
supplier rebates that increase based on different levels of purchases are recognized when there is certainty that the current level of purchases will trigger a higher rebate earned 
valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired 
other intangible assets consist of customer lists and relationships  purchased technology and patents and trademarks 
goodwill for our four reporting units is reviewed for impairment at least annually using a two step process 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit  as computed primarily by present value cash flow calculations  to its book carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and we would then complete step in order to measure the impairment loss 
in step  the implied fair value is compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the implied fair value is calculated by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step to all of its assets and liabilities including unrecognized intangible assets and any excess in fair value that is not assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 

table of contents management also reviews other intangible assets with finite lives for impairment at least annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate impairment 
if the carrying value of the finite lived intangible assets exceeds the discounted cash flows resulting from the use and disposition of the asset  the carrying value is written down to fair value in the period identified 
indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually for impairment by calculating the fair value of the assets and comparing with their carrying value 
in assessing fair value  management generally utilizes a relief from royalty method 
during the fourth quarters of and  management completed the annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment reviews with no impairments to the carrying values identified 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted sales growth rates  forecasted operating margin improvements and our cost of capital or discount rate  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans 
additionally  in assessing goodwill impairment we considered the implied control premium and concluded it was reasonable based on other recent market transactions 
changes in these estimates or a continued decline in general economic conditions could change our conclusion regarding an impairment of goodwill and potentially result in a non cash impairment loss in a future period 
the discount rate  sales growth and operating margin improvement assumptions are the three material assumptions utilized in our calculations of the present value cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units when performing the annual goodwill impairment test and in testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
we utilize a cash flow approach level valuation technique in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  where the discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital rate 
the cash flow model used to derive fair value is most sensitive to the discount rate  sales growth and operating margin improvement assumptions used 
the estimated fair value of the reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets has historically exceeded the carrying value of such reporting units or indefinite lived intangible assets by a substantial amount 
we perform a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate  revenue growth and operating margin improvement assumptions 
the discount rate could increase by more than of the discount rate utilized  the sales growth assumption could decline to a zero growth environment  or costs could remain at the current spending level with no cost savings realized in future periods and our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets would continue to have fair value in excess of carrying value 
we do not have any reporting units that are at risk of failing step of our goodwill impairment test 
also  we do not have any indefinite lived intangible assets at risk of failing our impairment test 
there have been no significant events since the timing of our impairment tests that would have triggered additional impairment testing 
the assumptions used in our impairment testing could be adversely affected by certain of the risks discussed in risk factors in item a of this report 
for additional information about goodwill  see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension and post retirement medical obligations we sponsor several defined benefit plans for certain hourly and salaried employees 
we sponsor post retirement medical benefits for certain us employees 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans and post retirement medical plans in accordance with gaap  which requires the amount recognized in financial statements to be determined on an actuarial basis 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover  medical trend rates and discount rates 
a change in these assumptions could cause actual results to differ from those reported 
a reduction of basis points in the long term rate of return and a reduction of basis points in the discount rate would have increased our pension expense  in a increase in the medical trend rates would not have a material effect on post retirement medical expense or the post retirement benefit obligation 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements  for further details regarding accounting for pensions and post retirement medical benefits 
income taxes at each period end  it is necessary for us to make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including  but not limited to the expected operating income or loss for the year  projections of the proportion of income or loss earned and taxed in the foreign jurisdictions and the extent to which this income or loss may also be taxed in the united states  permanent and temporary differences  the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of uncertain tax positions 
our income tax returns  like those of most companies  are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities 
we record an accrual for more likely than not exposures after evaluating the positions associated with our various income tax filings 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

table of contents forward looking statements certain statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements

these risks  uncertainties and other factors include  but are not limited to  deterioration in general economic conditions  both domestic and international  that may adversely affect our business  fluctuations in availability and prices of raw materials  including raw material shortages and other supply chain disruptions  and the inability to pass along or delays in passing along raw material cost increases to our customers  dependence of internal sales and earnings growth on business cycles affecting our customers and growth in the domestic and international coatings industry  market share loss to  and pricing or margin pressure from  larger competitors with greater financial resources  significant indebtedness that restricts the use of cash flow from operations for acquisitions and other investments  dependence on acquisitions for growth  and risks related to future acquisitions  including adverse changes in the results of acquired businesses  the assumption of unforeseen liabilities and disruptions resulting from the integration of acquisitions  risks and uncertainties associated with operations and achievement of profitable growth in developing markets  including asia and central and south america  loss of business with key customers  damage to our reputation and business resulting from product claims or recalls  litigation  customer perception and other matters  our ability to respond to technology changes and to protect our technology  changes in governmental regulation  including more stringent environmental  health and safety regulations  our reliance on the efforts of vendors  government agencies  utilities and other third parties to achieve adequate compliance and avoid disruption of our business  unusual weather conditions adversely affecting sales  changes in accounting policies and standards and taxation requirements such as new tax laws or revised tax law interpretations  the nature  cost and outcome of pending and future litigation and other legal proceedings  and civil unrest and the outbreak of war and other significant national and international events 
we undertake no obligation to subsequently revise any forward looking statement to reflect new information  events or circumstances after the date of such statement 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our foreign sales and results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
as most of our underlying costs are denominated in the same currency as our sales  the effect has not been material 
we have not hedged our exposure to translation gains and losses  however  we have reduced our exposure by borrowing funds in local currencies 
a adverse change in foreign currency rates is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we are also subject to interest rate risk 
at october   approximately of our total debt consisted of floating rate debt 
from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of either our variable or fixed rate debt 
assuming the current level of borrowings  a increase in interest rates from those in effect at the end of the fourth quarter would not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position
