item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
certain customers gtech is our most significant customer 
we currently have an ongoing oem purchase agreement  as amended in february the gtech thermal printer agreement with gtech that provides for the sale of thermal on line lottery printers and spare parts  at fixed prices  through june  in december  we signed a new five year agreement effective november   with gtech the gtech new thermal printer agreement 
under the terms of the new agreement  we will provide gtech with their next generation thermal lottery printers for various lottery applications 
the terms of the new agreement require that gtech exclusively purchase all of its requirements for thermal on line lottery printers from us and that we exclusively sell such printers to gtech 
t he exclusivity period will extend for four years from the start of production of the new printer  which is expected to commence in the fall of sales to gtech and other customers representing or more of our total net sales were as follows year ended december  gtech customer a customer b customers represented less than of total net sales backlog our backlog of firm orders was approximately  as of february   compared to  as of february  based on customers current delivery requirements  we expect to ship our entire current backlog during competition the market for transaction based printers is extremely competitive  and we expect such competition to continue in the future 
we compete with a number of companies  many of which have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than us 
we believe our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control  including durability  reliability  quality  design capability  product customization  price  customer support  success in developing new products  manufacturing expertise and capacity  supply of component parts and materials  strategic relationships with suppliers  the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  general market  economic and political conditions and  in some cases  the uniqueness of our products 
in the banking and pos market  our major competitor is epson america  inc  which holds a dominant market position of the pos markets into which we sell 
we also compete  to a much lesser extent  with transaction printer group  star micronics america  inc  citizen cbm america corporation  pertech resources  inc  addmaster  and samsung bixolon 
certain competitors of ours have greater financial resources  lower costs attributable to higher volume production and sometimes offer lower prices than us 
in the lottery market consisting principally of on line lottery transaction printing  we hold a leading position  based largely on our long term purchase agreements with gtech  which holds approximately market share of the worldwide on line lottery market 
we compete in this market based solely on our ability to provide specialized  custom engineered products to gtech 
in the casino and gaming market consisting principally of slot machine and video lottery terminal transaction printing  we compete with several companies including futurelogic  inc  nanoptix  inc  custom engineering spa and others 
certain of our products sold for casino and gaming applications compete based upon our ability to provide highly specialized products  custom engineering and ongoing technical support 

table of contents the tsg business is highly fragmented  and we compete with numerous competitors of various sizes  including internet resellers  depending on the geographic area 
our strategy for competing in our markets is to continue to develop new products and product line extensions  to increase our geographic market penetration  to take advantage of strategic relationships  and to lower product costs by sourcing certain products overseas 
although we believe that our products  operations and relationships provide a competitive foundation  there can be no assurance that we will compete successfully in the future 
in addition  our products utilize certain inkjet  thermal and impact printing technology 
if other technologies  or variations to existing technologies  were to evolve or become available to us  it is possible that we would incorporate these technologies into our products 
alternatively  if such technologies were to evolve or become available to our compe titors  our products could become obsolete  which would have a significant negative impact on our business 
research and development activities research  development  and engineering expenditures represent costs incurred in the experimental or laboratory sense aimed at discovery and or application of new knowledge in developing a new product or process  or in bringing about significant improvement in an existing product or process 
we spent approximately   and  in  and  respectively  on engineering  design and product development efforts in connection with specialized engineering and design to introduce new products and to customize or improve existing products

risk factors investors should carefully consider the risks  uncertainties and other factors described below  as well as other disclosures in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  because they could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and growth prospects 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not known to us now or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
we assume no obligation and specifically disclaim any such obligation to update these risk factors or any other forward looking statements contained in this annual report to reflect actual results  changes in assumptions or other factors affecting such forward looking statements  except as required by law 
current economic conditions and market disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
as widely reported  financial markets throughout the world experienced extreme disruption in and  including  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others  failure and potential failures of major financial institutions and unprecedented government support of financial institutions 
the financial  casino and gaming industries have been more severely impacted by the current economic downturn than other industries and this 
table of contents may lead our customers in these industries to reduce  or discontinue  spending on our products which could adversely impact our business 
a recurrence of these developments or a continuation of the general economic downturn may adversely impact our business and financial condition in a number of additional ways  including impacts beyond those typically associated with other recent downturns in the us and foreign economies 
the slowdown could lead to reduced capital spending by end users  which could adversely affect our product sales 
a tightening of credit in financial markets and the general economic downturn may adversely affect the ability of our customers  suppliers  outsource manufacturer and channel partners eg  distributors and resellers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations an d to perform their obligations with the company 
the tightening could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services  could negatively impact our ability to collect our accounts receivable on a timely basis  could result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable being required  and in the event of the contraction in our sales  could lead to excess inventory and require additional reserves for obsolescence 
significant volatility and fluctuations in the rates of exchange for the us dollar against foreign currencies could negatively impact our customer pricing and adversely affect our results 
we are unable to predict the duration and severity of the current economic downturn and disruption in financial markets or their effects on our business and results of operations  but the consequences may be materially adverse and more severe than other recent economic slowdowns 
our success will depend on our ability to sustain and manage growth 
as part of our business strategy  we intend to pursue an aggressive growth strategy 
assuming this growth occurs  it will require the expansion of distribution relationships in international markets  the successful development and marketing of new products  expanded customer service and support  and the continued implementation and improvement of our operational  financial and management information systems 
to the extent that we seek growth through acquisitions  our ability to manage our growth will also depend on our ability to integrate businesses that have previously operated independently 
we may not be able to achieve this integration without encountering difficulties or experiencing the loss of key employees  customers or suppliers 
it may be difficult to design and implement effective financial controls for combined operations and differences in existing controls for each business may result in weaknesses that require remediation when the financial controls and reporting functions are combined 
as we pursue acquisitions  we may incur legal  accounting and other transaction related expenses for unsuccessful acquisition attempts that could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in wh ich they are incurred 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our growth strategy  or that we can successfully manage expanded operations 
as the company expands  we may from time to time experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion 
failure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in the lottery market  we have been dependent on sales to one large customer  the loss of this customer or reduction in orders from this customer could materially affect our sales 
we expect that sales to one large customer will continue to represent a significant percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
a reduction  delay or cancellation in orders from this customer  including reductions or delays due to market  economic  or competitive conditions in the industries in which we serve  could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations 
we rely on resellers to sell our products and services 
we use a variety of distribution channels  including oems and distributors  to market our products 
we may be adversely impacted by any conflicts that could arise between and among our various sales channels 
our dependence upon resellers exposes us to numerous risks  including loss of channel and the ability to bring new products to market  concentration of credit risk  including disruption in distribution should the resellers financial condition deteriorate  reduced visibility to end user demand and pricing issues which makes forecasting more difficult  resellers leveraging their buying power to change the terms of pricing  payment and product delivery schedules  and direct competition should a reseller decide to manufacture printers internally or source printers from a competitor 
we cannot guarantee that resellers will not reduce  delay or eliminate purchases from us  which could have a material adverse effect upon the business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate 
our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year and are likely to continue to vary due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  who may derive their expectations by extrapolating data from recent historical operating results  the market price of our common stock will likely decline 
fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition may be due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those identified throughout this risk factors section 
table of contents market acceptance of our products  both domestically and internationally  development of new competitive printers by others  our responses to price competition  our level of research and development activities  changes in the amount that we spend to develop  acquire or license new products  consumables  technologies or businesses  changes in the amount we spend to promote our products and services  changes in the cost of satisfying our warranty obligations and servicing our installed base of printers  delays between our expenditures to develop and market new or enhanced printers and consumables and the generation of sales from those products  the geographic distribution of our sales  availability of third party components at reasonable prices  general economic and industry conditions  including changes in interest rates affecting returns on cash balances and investments  that affect customer demand  severe weather events such as hurricanes that can disrupt or interrupt the operation of our customers or suppliers facilities  and changes in accounting rules 
due to all of the foregoing factors  and the other risks discussed in this report  quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be an indicator of future performance 
we depend on key personnel  the loss of which could materially impact our business 
our future success will depend in significant part upon the continued service of certain key management and other personnel and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial  technical and sales and marketing personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to recruit and retain such personnel 
the loss of either bart c 
shuldman  the company s chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  or steven a 
demartino  executive vice president  chief financial officer  treasurer and secretary  or the loss of certain groups of key employees  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our stock price may fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to variations in quarterly operating results and other factors  such as changes in our business  operations or prospects  developments in our relationships with our customers  announcements of new products or services by us or by our competitors  announcement or completion of acquisitions by us or by our competitors  changes in existing or adoption of additional government regulations  unfavorable or reduced analyst coverage  and prevailing domestic and international market and economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years 
broad market fluctuations  general economic conditions and specific conditions in the industries in which we operate may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
limited trading volume of our capital stock may contribute to its price volatility 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global market 
during the twelve months ended december   the average daily trading volume for our common stock as reported by the nasdaq global market was approximately  shares 
we are uncertain whether a more active trading market in our common stock will develop 
in addition  many investment banks no longer find it profitable to provide securities research on micro cap and small cap companies 
if any analyst were to discontinue coverage of our common stock  our trading volume may be further reduced 
as a result  relatively small trades may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  which could increase the volatility and depress the price of our common stock 
future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline 
in the future  we may sell additional shares of our common stock in public or private offerings  and we may also issue additional shares of our common stock to finance future acquisitions 
shares of our common stock are also available for future sale pursuant to stock options that we have granted to our employees  and in the future we may grant additional stock options and other forms of equity compensation to our employees 
sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for shares of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings 
if we are unable to enforce our patents or if it is determined that we infringe patents held by others it could damage our business 
prosecuting and defending patent lawsuits is very expensive 
we are committed to aggressively asserting and defending our technology and 
table of contents related intellectual property  which we have spent a significant amount of money to develop 
these factors could cause us to become involved in new patent litigation in the future 
the expense of prosecuting or defending these future lawsuits could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we were to lose a patent lawsuit in which another party is asserting that our products infringe its patents  we would likely be prohibited from marketing those products and could also be liable for significant damages 
either or both of these results may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we lose a patent lawsuit in which we are claiming that another party s products are infringing our patents and thus  are unable to enforce our patents  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of other parties rights  we may become involved in disputes relating to our assertion of our own intellectual property rights 
whether we are defe nding the assertion of intellectual property rights against us or asserting our intellectual property rights against others  intellectual property litigation can be complex  costly  protracted  and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief  and the measures of damages in intellectual property litigation are complex and often subjective or uncertain 
thus  any adverse determinations in this type of litigation could subject us to significant liabilities and costs 
during the course of these lawsuits there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions  and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could harm the market price of our stock 
the inability to protect intellectual property could harm our reputation  and our competitive position may be materially damaged 
our intellectual property is valuable and provides us with certain competitive advantages 
copyrights  patents  trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of our products or  without authorization  to obtain and use information which we regard as trade secrets 
infringement on the proprietary rights of others could put us at a competitive disadvantage  and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly 
third parties may claim that we violated their intellectual property rights 
to the extent of a violation of a third party s patent or other intellectual property right  we may be prevented from operating our business as planned and may be required to pay damages  to obtain a license  if available  or to use a non infringing method  if possible  to accomplish our objectives 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel 
if such claims are successful  they could result in costly judgments or settlements 
we compete in highly competitive markets  which are likely to become more competitive 
competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements 
we face significant competition in developing and selling our printers  transaction supplies and services 
principal competitors have substantial marketing  financial  development and personnel resources 
to remain competitive  we believe we must continue to provide technologically advanced printers that satisfy the user demands  superior customer service  high levels of quality and reliability  and dependable and efficient distribution networks 
we cannot ensure we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions  lower gross profit margins and loss of market share  and could require increased spending on research and development  sales and marketing and customer support 
some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products 
any of these factors could reduce our earnings 
we have outsourced a large portion of the assembly of our printers to a contract manufacturer and will be dependent on them for the manufacturing of such printers 
a failure by this contract manufacturer  or any disruption in such manufacturing  may adversely affect our business results 
in an effort to achieve additional cost savings and operation benefits  we have continued to outsource the manufacturing and assembly of our printers to a contract manufacturer in china 
however  to the extent we rely on a third party service provider for manufacturing services  we may incur increased business continuity risks 
we will no longer be able to exercise control over the assembly of certain of our printers or any related operations or processes  including the internal controls associated with operations and processes conducted and the quality of our products assembled by the contract manufacturer 
if we are unable to effectively develop and implement our outsourcing strategy  we may not realize cost structure efficiencies and our operating and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if the contract manufacturer experiences business difficulties or fails to meet our manufacturing needs  then we may be unable to meet production requirements  may lose revenue and may not be able to maintain relationships with our customers 
without the contract 
table of contents manufacturer continuing to manufacture our products and the continuing operation of the contract manufacturer s facility  we will have limited means for the final assembly of a majority of our printers until we are able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility  which could be costly and time consuming and have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results 
the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in foreign jurisdictions may lead to an increase in reputational risk 
although we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost revenue and profits in an amount we consider adequate  this insurance does not cover all possible situations 
in addition  the business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact  both short term and long term  on relations with our existing customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them 
the contract manufacturer has access to our intellectual property  which increases the risk of infringement or misappropriation of this intellectual property 
we source some of our component parts and consumable products from sole source suppliers  any disruptions may impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products 
a disruption in the supply of such component parts and consumable products could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
we sell a significant portion of our products internationally and purchase important components from foreign suppliers 
these circumstances create a number of risks 
we sell a significant amount of our products to customers outside the united states 
shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales 
risks associated with sales and purchases outside the united states include fluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales  or increase costs of purchasing  in foreign countries 
foreign governments may impose burdensome tariffs  quotas  taxes  trade barriers or capital flow restrictions 
political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products or put our foreign assets at risk 
restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in or purchase from certain markets 
potentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries  such as china  may limit recourse against infringing products or cause us to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories 
if market conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected  a valuation allowance may be required for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which may be used to reduce taxable income in the future 
we assess the realization of these deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis  and if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of these assets will not be realized  an income tax valuation allowance is recorded 
if market conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected  or there is a change to applicable tax rules  future assessments may result in a determination that it is more likely than not that some or all of our net deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish a valuation allowance for all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial conditi on 
we cannot provide any assurance that current laws  or any laws enacted in the future  will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operations are subject to laws  rules  regulations  including environmental regulations  government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
changes in laws  rules  regulations  policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products  which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results 
if we do not comply with applicable laws  rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted 
our business could be adversely affected by actual or threatened terrorist attacks or the related heightened security measures  military actions and other efforts to combat terrorism 
our business could be adversely affected by actual or threatened terrorist attacks or the related heightened security measures  military actions and other efforts to combat terrorism 
it is possible that terrorist attacks could be directed at important locations for the gaming industry 
heightened security measures and other efforts to combat terrorism may also have an adverse effect on the gaming industry by reducing tourism 
any of these developments could also negatively affect the general economy and consumer confidence 
any downturn in the economy or in the gaming industry in particular could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  heightened security measures may cause certain governments to restrict the import export of g oods  which may have an adverse effect on our ability to buy sell goods 

table of contents additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business 
should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events  these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition  and results of operations

overview was a year of solid performance for transact  especially given the unprecedented worldwide economic recession we faced throughout the year 
our focus on market diversity along with prudent cost reduction initiatives led us to achieve positive financial results during one of most difficult economic times ever 
we shipped over  printers during and our financial results included improved operating margin  net income and earnings per share as compared to we also generated solid positive cash flow during  as we increased our cash balance from  at the end of to over  at the end of we continue to focus on sales growth in our core markets banking and pos  casino and gaming  lottery  and in our tsg to drive increased profitability 
during  our total net sales decreased to approximately  see the table below for a breakdown of our sales by market 
year ended year ended change in thousands december  december  banking and pos casino and gaming lottery tsg total net sales sales of our banking and pos printers increased in compared to in the banking market we focus mainly on supplying printers for use in bank teller stations at banks and financial institutions primarily in the us in the banking market  opportunities are project oriented and as a result  our banking printer sales can fluctuate significantly year to year 
during  we won a significant follow on order from our largest banking customer 
as a result of this order  our banking printer sales increased more than fivefold from and we completed shipments for this customer s project during in the pos market  we focus primarily on supplying printers that print receipts or linerless 
table of contents labels for customers in the restaurant  hospitality and specialty retail markets 
sales of our pos printers declined in largely due to a decline in sales of our legacy line of pos impact printers as these printers continue to be replaced by our newer thermal and inkjet printers 
despite the decrease in sales from legacy pos printers  we experienced a increase in sales of our two new printer products for mcdonalds the ithaca thermal receipt label printer which is used at the pos terminal to print either a receipt at the front counter or a label at th e grill station and the ithaca label printer which is used to print labels for mcdonalds new combined beverage initiative 
during  we benefited from increasing sales of printers for both of these mcdonald s initiatives  with the majority related to the rollout of printers for the combined beverage initiative that is currently nearing completion 
looking ahead  we expect to continue to benefit from our relationship with mcdonalds as mcdonalds increases the pace of its rollout of a new pos system in all  of its stores which we expect to result in increasing sales of our ithaca printer throughout in our casino and gaming market  our focus lies primarily in supplying printers for use in slot machines at casinos and racetracks  as well as in other gaming devices that print tickets or receipts  worldwide 
during  worldwide casino and gaming printer sales decreased compared to on the positive side  our early attention to the international casino and gaming market is paying off  as these sales grew for the second consecutive year in in fact  our international sales increased from  representing more than half or of our total worldwide casino and gaming sales for the first time during this increase was led by a increase in our line of off premise gaming printers used primarily in europe in various gaming machines that print receipts inste ad of tickets 
however  even with the increase in our international sales  we could not overcome continued weakness in the domestic casino market  where we experienced a decline in sales as the replacement rate of slot machines in north american casinos plummeted to a historically low level in in the lottery market  we continue to hold a leading position based on our long term purchase agreement with gtech  our largest customer and the world s largest provider of lottery terminals  with approximately a market share 
gtech has been our customer since  and we continue to maintain a good relationship with them 
in fact  during we expanded our long standing relationship with gtech by executing a new exclusive purchase agreement to develop and supply them with their next generation online thermal lottery printer 
pursuant to the new agreement  gtech will exclusively purchase all of its requirements for thermal on line lottery printers from us and we will exclusively sell such printers to gtech for four years from the start of production of the new printer  which is expected to commence in the fall of this new agreement will now extend our relationship with gtech through at least currently  we fulfill substantially all of gtech s printer requirements for lottery terminal installations and upgrades worldwide 
during  total printer sales to gtech decreased approximately  compared to  a year of record level sales compared to historical levels from gtech 
our sales to gtech each year are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations gtech performs 
our sales to gtech are not indicative of gtech s overall business or revenue 
our transact services group  which sells service  replacement parts and consumable products  including receipt paper  ribbons and inkjet cartridges  continues to offer a substantial growth opportunity and recurring revenue stream for transact 
tsg revenue continued to increase in  rising from during  our sales benefited from significantly higher inkjet cartridge sales to a large banking customer 
during  this large customer purchased approximately two years worth of inkjet cartridges based on their annual average consumption rate 
as a result  we expect sales of inkjet cartridges to this customer to be significantly lower in compared to we also expect this customer to re sume purchases of inkjet cartridges at their annual average consumption rate beginning in in addition  during we experienced expanding sales of paper and other consumable products through our e commerce website  www 
transactsupplies 
com 
we plan to continue to focus on enhancing our e commerce efforts throughout operationally  we made a substantial change to our printer production operations during  as we transitioned from assembling printers domestically in our ithaca  ny facility to sourcing fully built printers from our contract manufacturer in china 
we completed this transition during the fourth quarter of and we now will source more than of our printer production to china

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect both balance sheet items and income statement categories 
such estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and certain assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the particular circumstances 
we evaluate our assumptions on an ongoing basis by comparing actual results with our estimates 
actual results may differ from the original estimates 
the following accounting policies are those that we believe to be most critical in the preparation of our financial statements 
these items utilize assumptions and estimates about the effect of future events that are inherently uncertain and are therefore based on our judgment 
please refer to note summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition our typical contracts include the sale of printers  which are sometimes accompanied by separately priced extended warranty contracts 
we also sell replacement parts  consumables  and other repair services sometimes pursuant to multi year product maintenance contracts  which are not included in the original printer sale and are ordered by the customer as needed 
we recognize revenue pursuant to the guidance within asc  revenue recognition 
specifically  revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery based on shipping terms which are generally fob shipping point has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assur ed 
we recognize revenue from the sale of printers to our distributors and resellers on a sell in basis and on substantially the same terms as we recognize revenue from all our other customers 
we provide for an estimate of product returns and price protection based on historical experience at the time of revenue recognition 
we account for all revenue arrangements involving multiple deliverables in accordance with asc  revenue recognition asc   multiple element arrangements 
for these arrangements  we consider whether the deliverables in an arrangement are within the scope of existing higher level gaap and apply such literature to the extent that it provides guidance regarding whether to separate multiple deliverable arrangements and how to allocate value among those separate units of accounting 
we also determine whether revenue arrangements consist of more than one unit of accounting at inception of the arrangement and as each item in the arrangement is delivered 
we allocate arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting based on the relative fair value for all units of accounting in the arrangement  except where amounts allocable to the delivered units is limited to that which is contingent upon the delivery of additional deliverables or meeting other specified performance conditions 
revenue related to extended warranty and product maintenance contracts is recognized pursuant to asc  separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
pursuant to this provision  revenue related to separately priced product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized over the term of the maintenance period 
we record deferred revenue for advance payments received from customers for maintenance contracts 
our customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience 
returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  but we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 
we offer some of our customers price protection as an incentive to carry inventory of our product 
these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices  we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold 
our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory  and we infrequently lower prices on current products 
as a result  the amounts paid under these plans have not been material 
however  we cannot guarantee that this minimal level will continue 
we charge our customers for shipping and handling services 
the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships 
any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 
accounts receivable we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts  including credit reviews of all new customer accounts  ongoing credit evaluations of current customers  credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information  and adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we also provide an estimate of doubtful accounts based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was  or less than of outstanding accounts receivable  which we feel is appropriate c onsidering the overall quality of our accounts receivable 
while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the reserves established  we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 

table of contents inventory our inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we review market value based on historical usage and estimates of future demand 
assumptions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments are made  as necessary  to reflect changing market conditions 
based on these reviews  inventory write downs are recorded  as necessary  to reflect estimated obsolescence  excess quantities and market value 
sho uld circumstances change and we determine that additional inventory is subject to obsolescence  additional write downs of inventory could result in a charge to income 
goodwill we test the impairment of goodwill each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our last assessment as of december  factors considered that may trigger an impairment review are significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value 
goodwill amounted to  at december  and we have determined that no goodwill impairment has occurred 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences between the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  as well as net operating losses  tax credits and other carryforwards 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income  and to the extent that we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance or tax reserves with respect to our deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based upon historical results and forecasted taxable income over future years  and match this forecast against the basis differences  deductions available in future years and the limitations allowed for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to ensure that there is adequate support for the realization of the deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance or tax reserve  in the event we were to determine that w e would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance or tax reserves would be charged as a reduction to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize future deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance or tax reserves would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
among other things this provision prescribes a minimum recognition threshold that an income tax position must meet before it is recorded in the reporting entity s financial statements 
it also requires that the effects of such income tax positions be recognized only if  as of the balance sheet reporting date  it is more likely than not ie  more than a likelihood that the income tax position will be sustained based solely on its technical merits 
when making this assessment  management must assume that the responsible taxing authority will examine the income tax position and have full knowledge of all relevant facts and other pertinent information 
the accounting guidance also clarifies the met hod of accruing for interest and penalties when there is a difference between the amount claimed  or expected to be claimed  on a company s income tax returns and the benefits recognized in the financial statements 
warranty we generally warrant our products for up to months and record the estimated cost of such product warranties at the time the sale is recorded 
estimated warranty costs are based upon actual past experience of product repairs and the related estimated cost of labor and material to make the necessary repairs 
if actual future product repair rates or the actual costs of material and labor differ from the estimates  adjustments to the accrued warranty liability and related warranty expense would be made 
contingencies we record an estimated liability related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes pursuant to asc contingencies 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation  audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 
if the actual liabilities are settled in an amount greater than those recorded on the balance sheet  a charge to income would be recorded 
share based compensation we calculate share based compensation expense in accordance with asc compensation stock compensation using the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share based awards 
the key assumptions for this valuation method include the expected term of an option grant  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  dividend yield  and forfeiture rate 
the determination of these assumptions is based on past history and future expectations  and is subject to a high level of judgment 
to the extent any of the assumptions were to change from year to year  the fair valu e of new option grants may vary significantly

net income loss 
we reported net income in of  or per diluted share compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share in liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities  capital expenditures  stock repurchases  access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
internal cash generation together with currently available cash and investments  available borrowing facilities and an ability to access credit lines  if needed  are expected to be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures  and any increase in working capital that would be required to accommodate a higher level of business activity 
we actively seek to expand by acquisition as well as through the growth of our current business 
while a significant acquisition may require additional debt and or equity financing  although no assurances can be given  we believe that we would be able to obtain additional financing based on our historical earnings performance 
the recent and unprecedented disruption in the current credit markets has had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions 
at this point in time  our liquidity has not been impacted by the current credit environment and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future 
we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets

this update provides clarification of the fair value measurement of financial liabilities when a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability level input of the valuation hierarchy is not available

multiple deliverable revenue arrangements in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this asu establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue generating activities 
this asu provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables  measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments in this asu also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  including information about the nature and terms  significant deliverables  and its performance within arrangements 
the amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition

we are currently evaluating impact of this asu 
resource sufficiency we believe that our cash on hand  cash flows generated from operations and borrowings available under the td bank credit facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs  finance our capital expenditures and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months 
impact of inflation we believe that our business has not been affected to a significant degree by inflationary trends during the past three years 
however  inflation is still a factor in the worldwide economy and may increase the cost of purchasing printers from our contract manufacturer in china  as well as the cost of certain raw materials  component parts and labor used in the production of our products 
it also may increase our operating expenses  manufacturing overhead expenses and the cost to acquire or replace fixed assets 
despite growing costs of oil  gas and freight over the last two years  we have generally been able to maintain or improve our profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements  cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent  price increases  and we expect to be able to do the same d uring as such  we do not believe that inflation will have a significant impact on our business during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the investment of our available cash and cash equivalents 
in accordance with our investment policy  we strive to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk  which includes the risk of interest rate movements 
risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital 
an effective increase or decrease of in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of our sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results in the future 
we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we estimate that the combined translational and transactional impact of a overall movement in exchange rates from december  principally the uk pound sterling would have an immaterial effect on a pre tax basis
