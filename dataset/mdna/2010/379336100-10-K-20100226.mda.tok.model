item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion presents management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report 
results of operations general our reportable segments consist of north america ocd  north america subsea  latin america  west africa  middle east  and asia pacific india 
during the first quarter of  we discontinued allocation of corporate stewardship costs to our reportable segments 
this change in allocation methodology is reflected as a retrospective change to the financial information and the narrative description in management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition presented for the years ended december   and this change did not have an impact on our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations  statements of stockholders equity  or consolidated statements of cash flows 
our results of operations are affected by the overall level of activity of the offshore construction industry within each worldwide region in which we operate 
this overall level of offshore construction activity is principally determined by four factors the oil and gas industry s ability to economically justify placing discoveries of oil and gas reserves in production  the oil and gas industry s need to maintain  repair  and replace existing pipelines and structures to extend the life of production  the oil and gas industry s need to clear structures from the lease once the oil and gas reserves have been depleted  and weather events such as major hurricanes 
our results of operations ultimately reflect our ability to secure jobs through competitive bidding and manage those jobs to successful completion 
the competition and inherent operating risks vary between the worldwide regions in which we operate  and these challenges affect individual segment profitability 
our results of operations are measured in terms of revenues  gross profit  and gross profit as a percentage of revenues margins and are principally driven by three factors our level of offshore construction and subsea activity activity  pricing  which can be affected by contract mix pricing  and operating efficiency on any particular construction project productivity 
offshore construction services the level of our offshore construction activity in any given period has a significant impact on our results of operations 
the offshore construction business is capital and personnel intensive  and  as a practical matter  many of our costs  including the wages of skilled workers  are effectively fixed in the short run regardless of whether or not our vessels are being utilized in productive service 
in general  as activity increases  a greater proportion of these fixed costs are recovered through operating revenues and  consequently  gross profit and margins increase 
conversely  as activity decreases  our revenues decline  but our costs do not decline proportionally  thereby constricting our gross profit and margins 
our activity level can be affected by changes in demand due to economic or other conditions in the oil and gas exploration industry  seasonal conditions in certain geographical areas  and or our ability to win the bidding for available jobs 
our results of operations depend heavily upon our ability to obtain  in a very competitive environment  a sufficient quantity of offshore construction contracts with sufficient gross profit margins to recover the fixed costs associated with our offshore construction business 
most of our offshore construction revenues are obtained through international contracts which are generally larger  more complex  and of longer duration than our typical domestic contracts 
most of these international contracts require a significant amount of working capital  are generally bid on a lump sum basis  and are secured by a letter of credit or performance bond 
operating cash flows may 
table of contents be negatively impacted during periods of escalating activity due to the substantial amounts of cash required to initiate these projects and the normal delays between cash expenditures by us and cash receipts from the customer 
additionally  lump sum contracts for offshore construction services are inherently risky and are subject to many unforeseen circumstances and events that may affect productivity 
when productivity decreases with no offsetting decrease in costs or increases in revenues  our contract margins erode compared to our bid margins 
in general  we are required to bear a larger share of project related risks during periods of weak demand for our services and a smaller share of risk during periods of high demand for our services 
consequently  our revenues and margins from offshore construction services are subject to a high degree of variability  even as compared to other businesses in the offshore energy industry 
claims and change orders are a significant aspect of any construction business and are particularly significant in the offshore construction industry 
a claim is an amount in excess of the contract price which a construction contractor seeks to collect from customers or others due to delays  errors in specifications or design  unapproved change orders  or other causes of unanticipated costs caused by the customer or others 
a change order is a request to alter the scope of work of a previously agreed upon construction contract 
change orders may include changes in specifications or design  method or manner of performance  facilities  equipment  site  or the period for completion of the work 
change orders are common in our business due to the nature of offshore construction contracts and sometimes add to the degree of project execution difficulty 
a change order usually increases the scope of work but may also decrease the scope and  consequently  the amount of contract revenue and costs which are recognized 
change orders can be initiated by us or the customer 
at the time of initiation  a change order may be approved or unapproved by either party  priced or unpriced  or defined or undefined regarding detailed scope 
even when the scope of work is defined  the associated increase or decrease in contract revenue may be governed by contract terms or may be negotiated later  sometimes after the work is performed 
subsea services most of our subsea revenues are the result of short term work  involve numerous smaller contracts  and are usually based on a day rate charge 
financial risks associated with these types of contracts are normally limited due to their short term and non lump sum nature 
however  some subsea contracts may involve longer term commitments that extend from the exploration  design and installation phases of a field throughout its useful life by providing irm services 
the financial risks associated with these commitments are low in comparison with our offshore construction activities due to the day rate structure of the contracts 
revenues and margins from our subsea activities tend to be more consistent than those from our offshore construction activities

depreciation and amortization in cost of operations the amount of depreciation and amortization expense  including the amortization of dry docking costs  included in our cost of operations for was million  compared to million included in this increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily caused by increased dry dock amortization related to two major construction vessels 
amortization of leasehold improvements to two of our leased vessels also contributed to the increase in depreciation and amortization 
stock based compensation expense decreased between the periods by million 
we expect amortization of our dry dock costs to be material to our operations in gross profit gross profit increased by million between and to a million gross profit for compared to a million gross loss for gross profit for was adversely affected by the losses incurred on the berri and qatif project in saudi arabia and the camarupim project in brazil 
cost overruns on the berri and qatif project and productivity and equipment delays on both projects resulted in substantial project deterioration during higher activity in north america ocd and north america subsea and higher margins in all segments  except asia pacific india and middle east  contributed to the increase 
loss on asset impairments loss on asset impairments decreased million in compared to during  primarily due to repair costs exceeding the future expected benefit of certain vessels  we retired two dsvs and three dive systems and recorded an aggregate impairment loss of million compared to an impairment loss in of million on the retirement of two dsvs 
gain on asset disposal net gains on the disposal of assets increased million from to net gains on asset disposals totaled million for primarily from the sale of one dsv  one cargo barge  one dlb  and one pipelay bury barge

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for  compared to million during decreased labor costs of million in all areas except north america ocd and asia pacific india was the primary driver of this decrease as well as decreases in travel costs  stock based compensation expense  and legal and professional fees 
these decreases are the result of our ongoing cost reduction efforts 
interest income interest income decreased by million to million during  compared to million for significantly lower interest rates in contributed to lower returns on cash balances and short term investments compared to interest expense interest expense decreased to million for compared to million for higher capitalized interest primarily driven by expenditures for ongoing construction of the global and global was responsible for the majority of the decrease 
capitalized interest for was million compared to million for interest expense for was affected by the reversal of million previously accrued interest expense related to the settlement of a previously uncertain tax position 
other income expense  net other income expense  net increased by million from primarily resulting from gains of million on foreign currency exchange rate transactions incurred in compared to exchange losses of million in and from proceeds of million in from insurance claims 
income taxes our effective tax rate was and  respectively  for the years ended december  and the tax rate in was adversely impacted by losses that could not be tax benefited and by taxes paid in tax jurisdictions with a deemed profit tax regime where tax is calculated as a percentage of revenue rather than being based upon net income  resulting in an income tax expense being recognized despite the reported loss 
comparatively  was profitable and benefitted from higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with deemed profit tax regimes and utilization of losses not previously tax benefitted 
segment information the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of our reportable segments during the twelve month periods ended december  and north america offshore construction division revenues were million in compared to million in the increase of million  or  between and was primarily due to the relocation of the hercules and sea constructor to the us gulf of mexico in early and increased utilization of the cherokee 
the increased revenue was partially offset by the reduction in the utilization of a the titan ii  which was on charter from our latin america segment during  b the chickasaw  and c the gp revenues in were negatively affected by adverse weather conditions including two major hurricanes and the extended dry docking of the cherokee 
loss before taxes was million for compared to million for this decrease in loss of million was primarily attributable to higher vessel utilization and higher margins from increased productivity 
north america subsea revenues generated in were million compared to million for  an increase of million  or

partially offsetting the 
table of contents increase were idle costs attributable to the norman commander that was relocated to the us gulf of mexico in may the project margins in were affected by competitive pricing and productivity issues on some of our projects as well as idle and startup costs associated with the addition of the global orion and olympic challenger 
in addition  we recorded a million impairment on a dsv during latin america revenues were million for compared to million for a decrease of million  or  in compared to was primarily due to lower activity in brazil and mexico 
income before taxes was million during compared to a loss before taxes of million in the increase of million was primarily attributable to higher project margins in brazil  partially offset by lower productivity on mexico projects and lower vessel utilization in brazil and mexico 
we completed the camarupim project in brazil in after experiencing a additional project deterioration of million attributable to increased costs associated with rescheduling diving work from the norman commander to a third party diving vessel and b increased project duration caused by third party equipment failure 
in comparison  we recorded a million loss on this project in west africa revenues were million for compared to million for this decrease of million  or  in compared to was primarily due to decreased activity attributable to low demand for services in the region 
we completed work on one construction project in compared to two major construction projects in income before taxes was million for compared to a loss before taxes of million for this increase in income before taxes of million was attributable to a increased project profitability due to increased pricing and productivity  b reduced vessel costs with the transfer of the hercules and sea constructor to north america in january of this year  c reduced vessel costs due to the sale of the sea puma  cb  and power barge  and d the reduction in labor  travel  and professional fees attributable to our decision to curtail operations in the region 
in addition  in we received a million insurance reimbursement related to prior year costs incurred on a project claim and reached a million settlement with a customer for recovery of the deterioration of the nigerian naira on remitted invoice payments and final payment of outstanding naira invoices in us dollars 
negatively impacting the loss before taxes were a the additional costs incurred related to idle vessel costs from low utilization and project productivity issues related to a project in nigeria  b a million impairment on a dsv  and c exchange losses of million primarily related to naira cash balances 
we began curtailment of our operations in this region beginning in the second quarter of as of the date of this annual report  we have no active projects in west africa

depreciation and amortization in cost of operations the amount of depreciation and amortization expense  including the amortization of dry docking costs  included in our cost of operations for was million  compared to million included in this increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily caused by increased dry dock amortization related to two major construction vessels and an increase in the amount of depreciation expense related to our major construction vessels with the addition of the global orion to the vessel fleet 
depreciation associated with our office expansion in the middle east and latin america also contributed to the increase in depreciation 
stock based compensation expense decreased between the periods by million 
we expect amortization of our dry dock costs to be material to our operations in gross profit gross profit decreased by million  or  between and to a million gross loss for compared to million gross profit for the decrease primarily reflects the adverse effects of the losses incurred on the berri and qatif project in saudi arabia and the camarupim project in brazil 
cost overruns on the berri and qatif project and productivity and equipment delays on both projects resulted in substantial project deterioration during results for include an estimate for losses through the projects anticipated completion dates in loss on asset impairments loss on asset impairments increased million in  compared to during  primarily due to high repair costs in excess of future benefit of certain vessels  we decided not to repair them and recorded an aggregate impairment loss of million on the retirement of two dsvs 
in  we recorded an impairment loss of million 
gain on asset disposal net gains on the disposal of assets decreased million from to net gains on asset disposals totaled million for primarily from the sale of a dsv 
net gains on asset disposals totaled million during  which primarily arose from sale of three dsvs  that were partially offset by losses on the disposal of ancillary dive support systems 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for  compared to million during increased labor costs in all areas except asia pacific india were responsible for the majority of this increase  as well as increased professional fees  rent expense  and computer expense  all related to our continued business expansion 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in amortization of stock compensation resulting from the recapture of stock expense related to performance shares and the net favorable impact related to the recapture of previously recognized stock expense resulting from the accelerated vesting of certain shares upon the resignation of our ceo in october interest income interest income decreased by million to million during  compared to million for lower interest rates and decreased cash balances in contributed to lower return on cash balances and short term investments compared to interest expense interest expense increased to million for compared to million for increased interest resulting from the issuance of million of convertible debentures in july was partially offset by a reversal of million previously accrued interest expense related to the settlement of a previously uncertain tax position 
other income expense  net other income expense  net decreased by million from primarily resulting from losses on foreign currency exchange rate differences incurred in and the nonrecurrence of a million recognized gain in related to the settlement of a claim for interrupted operations as a result of a oil spill in the gulf of mexico by a refinery adjacent to our property in louisiana 
income taxes our effective tax rate was and  respectively  for the twelve months ended december and the tax rate in was adversely impacted by losses that could not be tax benefited and also taxes paid in tax jurisdictions with a deemed profit tax regime where tax is calculated as a percentage of revenue rather than being based upon net income 
this resulted in an income tax expense being recognized despite the loss reported before taxes for the twelve months ended december  segment information the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of our reportable segments during the twelve month periods ended december  and north america offshore construction division revenues were million in compared to million in a decrease of million  or  between and was primarily due to lower activity related to market conditions driven by decreased demand for services  million related to the extended dry docking of the cherokee  and non compensated vessel standby costs during hurricanes gustav and ike 
loss before taxes was million for compared to income before taxes of million for this decrease of million was primarily attributable to lower revenues and lower margins on projects attributable to the continuing softening of market conditions in the gulf of mexico  lower profitability on derrick work impacted by operational issues  and non recovered vessel costs resulting from lower vessel utilization for north america subsea revenues were comparable between and revenues generated in were million compared to million for however  project profitability declined between the two years with increased competition affecting pricing  coupled with higher operating costs incurred in income before taxes was million for compared to million for this decrease of million  or  was attributable to lower margins resulting from increased competition affecting pricing as well as productivity issues affecting some of our projects 
idle and startup costs associated with the addition of the global orion and olympic challenger to the vessel fleet also negatively 
table of contents impacted the margins during in  higher project margins were generated from the norman commander which was subsequently transferred to the latin american region in april in addition  we recorded a million impairment on a dsv during latin america revenues were million for compared to million for an increase of million  or  in compared to was primarily due to additional revenue from expansion into brazil  partially offset by lower activity in mexico 
despite the increase in revenues  we reported a loss before taxes of million during compared to income before taxes of million in the decrease of million was primarily due to the favorable finalization of project claims and change orders in and the recording of a loss position on the camarupim project in brazil in for  the camarupim project was estimated to complete at a significant loss due to lower than expected productivity and vessel standby delays from mechanical and weather downtime 
results for therefore include an estimate for losses on the camarupim project through the project s estimated completion in this compares to high profit margins obtained from the favorable resolutions of change orders and claims on projects in mexico in west africa revenues were million for compared to million for this decrease of million  or  in compared to was primarily due to decreased activity in the region 
in  we performed two major construction projects in west africa compared to three major construction projects in loss before taxes was million for compared to a loss before taxes of million in in  additional costs were incurred related to idle vessel costs from low utilization and project productivity issues related to a project in nigeria 
in addition  we recorded a million impairment on a dsv in exchange losses of million primarily related to naira cash balances also negatively impacted the loss before taxes  however  this loss was partially offset by a reversal of previously accrued interest expense related to a favorable settlement of an uncertain tax position

middle east revenues were million for compared to million during this increase of million  or  for compared to was attributable to increased activity in the region 
during  two major projects were in progress compared to a lower level of construction activity during much of however  loss before taxes of million was reported during compared to income before taxes of million for due primarily to the significant deterioration in the berri and qatif project in saudi arabia during the loss on the berri and qatif project is primarily due to exceptional losses in productivity and cost overruns 
results for therefore include an estimate for losses on the berri and qatif project through the estimated completion date in the third quarter 
asia pacific india revenues were million for compared to million for this increase of million  or  for compared to was primarily attributable to higher activity during income before taxes was million for compared to million for this increase in profitability of million was primarily due to higher revenues  increased project margins  good project execution  and cost recoveries attributable to higher vessel utilization during 
table of contents utilization of major construction vessels worldwide utilization for our major construction vessels was   and for the fiscal years ended december    and  respectively 
utilization of our major construction vessels is calculated by dividing the total number of days major construction vessels are assigned to project related work by the total number of calendar days for the period 
dive support vessels  cargo launch barges  ancillary supply vessels and short term chartered project specific construction vessels are excluded from the utilization calculation 
we frequently use chartered anchor handling tugs  dive support vessels and  from time to time  construction vessels in our operations 
also  most of our international contracts which are generally larger  more complex and of longer duration are generally bid on a lump sum or unit rate vs 
day rate basis wherein we assume the risk of performance and changes in utilization rarely impact revenues but can have an inverse relationship to changes in profitability 
for these reasons  we consider utilization rates to have a relatively low direct correlation to changes in revenue and gross profit 
industry and business outlook the continued downturn in the worldwide economy is significantly impacting the offshore construction industry 
pricing pressures from potential customers and increased competition attributable to a decrease in bid activity is impacting our ability to win new project awards 
opportunities do remain and we continue to bid new projects 
however  neither the duration nor severity that the impact the worldwide recession will continue to have on our operations can be predicted with certainty 
we continue to expect weak demand for our services throughout during  our focus will remain on successful execution of our projects  building additional backlog  cost cutting initiatives  and cash conservation 
we continue to pursue new work  however  we have not yet been successful in obtaining new project awards sufficient for the size of our existing operations 
to the extent that we are not successful in building sufficient backlog  further cost cutting and cash conservation measures will be required  including closing offices  stacking idle vessels  asset sales and reducing our work force further 
as of december   our backlog totaled approximately million million for international regions and million for the gulf of mexico 
the majority of this backlog is scheduled to be performed in the amount of our backlog in north america is not a reliable indicator of the level of demand for our services due to the prevalence of short term contractual arrangements in this region 
liquidity and capital resources overview cash generated from operations  a decrease in our restricted cash requirements due to the ending of our interim cash collateralization period under our third amended and restated credit agreement the revolving credit facility and proceeds from the sale of certain assets provided the major sources of funds in these sources of funds sufficiently funded our operations and capital expenditures for expanding and modernizing our fleet of vessels 
the primary uses of cash during have been for funding capital spending 
we had firm capital commitments on projects  which were in progress at december   of approximately million with expenditures extending into  of which million is expected to be expended during  primarily for the construction of two new derrick pipelay vessels the global and global and the construction of two new sat systems 
total capital expenditures on committed and discretionary projects are expected to be approximately million 
the actual capital expenditures for may differ from our expectations due to changes in existing capital project schedules and or projected capital projects 

table of contents cash flows operating activities our cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million at december   compared to million at december  net cash provided by our operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used by our operating activities of million during this increase in net cash provided from operating activities reflects higher net income and reduced dry docking costs  partially offset by higher working capital needs 
the use of funds in was primarily attributable to the net loss from continuing operations  a net use of million of cash to fund working capital and the cost of dry docking activities of million 
investing activities investing activities used million of cash in  compared to million in during  cash was provided by asset sales of million and a million decrease in our restricted cash requirements due to the ending of our interim cash collateralization period under our revolving credit facility please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
partially offsetting these proceeds was million used to purchase property and equipment  resulting primarily from the expansion and upgrade to the fleet for the construction of two new derrick pipelay vessels the global and global 
the net cash used in was primarily due to purchases of property and equipment  totaling million and a million cash transfer to restricted cash as a result of the november  amendment to the revolving credit facility 
these uses of cash were partially offset by net sales of marketable securities totaling million 
financing activities financing activities used million of net cash in compared to using million in the net cash used in is primarily due to the repayment of long term debt 
the net cash used in is primarily due to the repurchase of our common stock under a repurchase program announced in august approximately million shares of company stock were repurchased in at a cost of approximately million 
long term debt our long term debt outstanding as of december  and includes carrying amounts of million and million  respectively  for the million of senior convertible debentures which carry an interest rate of per annum with semi annual interest payments 
these debentures are convertible into cash  and if applicable  into shares of our common stock 
we may redeem all or a part of the debentures any time on or after august   for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the holders of the debentures may require us to repurchase all or a part of their debentures for cash on august  and august  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures being redeemed plus accrued or unpaid interest  or upon the occurrence of certain types of fundamental changes 
our senior convertible debentures contain a default provision which permits the trustee or holders of the convertible debentures to accelerate such indebtedness in the event of our failure to pay principal when due or upon a default that results in the acceleration of any of our indebtedness in excess of million 
for more information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also maintain million of title xi bonds outstanding which carry an interest rate of per annum with semi annual principal payments of approximately million payable each february and august until maturity in our title xi bonds contain a cross default provision which provides that a default of our revolving credit facility is a default under our title xi bonds which may result in our bonds becoming due and payable under certain circumstances 
our revolving credit facility provides a borrowing capacity of up to million 
as of december   we had no borrowings against the facility and million of letters of credit outstanding thereunder 
due to the sale of one of the vessels mortgaged under the revolving credit facility  the effective borrowing capacity under this facility at december  is million 
we do have the option of increasing the capacity under this facility to million by mortgaging one of our vessels that is not currently in the collateralized vessel pool 
as a result of operating performance  we did not meet the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio under the facility at september  on november   we amended our revolving credit facility to temporarily require us  among other things  to cash collateralize letters of credit and bank guarantees 
during the 
table of contents interim cash collateralization period  no borrowings  letters of credit  or bank guarantees unsecured by cash were available to us under the revolving credit facility 
as a result of our operating performance  the interim cash collateralization period ended  effective june  for additional discussion see below under liquidity risk and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our revolving credit facility has a customary cross default provision triggered by a default of any of our other indebtedness  the aggregate principal amount of which is in excess of million 
at december   we were in compliance with the terms of our revolving credit facility 
our current financial projections indicate that we may not meet our leverage ratio covenant beginning in the second quarter of and continuing through the fourth quarter of we are currently in discussion with our lenders regarding these potential violations 
if we do not meet our leverage ratio  we may be required to cash collateralize our outstanding letters of credit or seek another remedy 
if we are required to cash collateralize letters of credit  it would reduce our available cash and may impact our ability to bid on future projects 
further  upon a covenant violation and the declaration of an event of default by our lenders  under the cross default provisions of our title xi bonds we may be subject to additional reporting requirements  we may be subject to additional covenants restricting our operations  and the maritime administration marad  guarantor of the bonds  may institute procedures that could ultimately allow the bondholders the right to demand payment of the bonds from marad 
marad can alternatively assume the obligation to pay the bonds when due 
as we have no outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility  an event of default related to the covenant failure would not trigger the cross default provision of our senior convertible debentures 
it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of discussions with our lenders or the effect that these potential violations may have on our financial position 
other indebtedness and obligations we also have a million short term credit facility at one of our foreign locations  which is secured by a letter of credit issued under our primary credit facility 
at december   we had million in cash overdrafts reflected in accounts payable  million of letters of credit outstanding  and million of credit availability under this particular credit facility 
charters we have a long term charter for the titan  a foot self propelled twin hulled dp derrick ship 
the vessel charter payments are approximately million annually 
the charter term expires in may this charter can be canceled by us at anytime  subject to a termination penalty of the transfer to the vessel owner of title to our dynamic positioning dp system used on the vessel 
the dp system was purchased and installed on the titan  at our cost  during the first quarter of for a total cost of million  with a book value at december  of million 
we have two long term charters for msvs 
the first msv charter  the norman commander  includes a fixed term five year lease with five annual renewal options  and requires monthly payments denominated in norwegian kroners at an annual rate of approximately million kroners or million as of december  
as of december   we had entered into forward foreign currency contracts that have enabled us to fulfill million of our remaining non cancellable norwegian kroner obligations under this charter at an average rate of kroners per us dollar 
the second msv charter  the olympic challenger  includes a five year  fixed term lease with one two year renewal option and three one year renewal options at an annual rate of approximately million 

table of contents future lease obligations the following table sets forth  as of december   our minimum rental commitments under operating leases with an initial non cancellable term of one year or more in thousands 
thereafter total summary of contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands long term debt principal only long term debt interest only operating lease obligations cancelable operating lease obligations non cancelable purchase obligations total assuming conversion on the earliest call date of august  of our senior convertible debentures 
primarily represents commitments outstanding for the construction of two saturation diving systems and the global and global which do not include capitalized interest 
the contractual obligations reported above exclude our liability of million recognized related to our provision for uncertain tax positions 
we have excluded such amounts as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business with customers  vendors  and others  we have entered into off balance sheet arrangements 
we provide guarantees and performance  bid  and payment bonds pursuant to agreements  or in connection with bidding  to obtain such agreements to perform construction services 
the aggregate amount of these guarantees and bonds at december  was million in surety bonds and million in bank guarantees and letters of credit 
the surety bonds are due to expire between january and january and the bank guarantees letters of credit are due to expire between january and july 
table of contents liquidity risk as a result of our operating performance  we did not meet the existing minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant in the third amended and restated credit agreement the revolving credit facility as of september  on november   the financial institutions participating in the revolving credit facility waived compliance with the covenant condition 
in consideration of this waiver  we and the participating financial institutions amended the revolving credit facility to temporarily cash collateralize letters of credit and bank guarantees  temporarily waive compliance with certain financial covenants  temporarily prohibit share repurchases  and temporarily maintain unencumbered liquidity of million 
on february   the revolving credit facility was further amended to remove the requirement to maintain unencumbered liquidity of million 
the effective date of this amendment is december  the length of the interim cash collateralization period was dependent on our future financial performance and ended june  for the remaining duration of the revolving credit facility after the cash collateralization period  the facility was further amended to allow for a new starting point in measuring financial performance  and permit borrowings and or the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees based on a rate premium over prime rate ranging from to or london interbank offered rate libor ranging from to based upon certain financial ratios 
during the interim cash collateralization period  no borrowings  letters of credit or bank guarantees unsecured by cash were available to us under the revolving credit facility 
all cash collateral was classified in our consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash 
as of december   we had no borrowing against the facility and million in letters of credit outstanding thereunder 
we also have a million short term credit facility at one of our foreign locations 
at december   the available borrowing under this facility was million 
at december   we were in compliance with the terms of our revolving credit facility 
our current financial projections indicate that we may not meet our leverage ratio covenant beginning in the second quarter of and continuing through the fourth quarter of we are currently in discussion with our lenders regarding these potential violations 
if we do not meet our leverage ratio  we may be required to cash collateralize our outstanding letters of credit or seek another remedy 
if we are required to cash collateralize letters of credit  it would reduce our available cash and may impact our ability to bid on future projects 
further  upon a covenant violation and the declaration of an event of default by our lenders  under the cross default provisions of our title xi bonds we may be subject to additional reporting requirements  we may be subject to additional covenants restricting our operations  and the maritime administration marad  guarantor of the bonds  may institute procedures that could ultimately allow the bondholders the right to demand payment of the bonds from marad 
marad can alternatively assume the obligation to pay the bonds when due 
as we have no outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility  an event of default related to the covenant failure would not trigger the cross default provision of our senior convertible debentures 
it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of discussions with our lenders or the effect that these potential violations may have on our financial position 
as of december   approximately million of our marketable securities were held in auction rate securities 
these securities are intended to provide liquidity through an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or sell them at par value 
as a result of liquidity issues in the global credit markets  our outstanding auction rate securities  as of december   have failed to settle at auction 
consequently  these investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds 
table of contents until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside the auction process 
in november  we accepted an auction rate security rights agreement the settlement from ubs related to million in par value of auction rate securities 
the settlement permits us to sell or put our auction rate securities back to ubs at par value at any time during the period from june  through july  we expect to put these auction rate securities back to ubs on june   the earliest date allowable under the settlement  if not sold prior to that date 
liquidity outlook during the next twelve months  we expect that balances of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  supplemented by cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund operations including increases in working capital required to fund any increases in activity levels  scheduled debt retirement  and currently planned capital expenditures 
based on expected operating cash flows and other sources of cash  we do not believe that our reduced project backlog or the illiquidity of our investments in auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet liquidity needs during the next twelve months 
however  a significant amount of our expected operating cash flows is based upon projects which have been identified  but not yet awarded 
if we are not successful in converting a sufficient number of our bids into project awards  we may not have sufficient liquidity to meet all of our needs and may be forced to postpone or cancel capital expenditures and take other actions including closing offices  stacking idle vessels  selling assets  and further reducing our workforce 
also  our current financial projections indicate that we may not meet our leverage ratio covenant beginning in the second quarter of and continuing through the fourth quarter of consequently  we may be required to cash collateralize our outstanding letters of credit or seek another remedy for the covenant violation 
we are currently in discussion with our lenders regarding these potential violations and cannot predict the outcome these potential violations may have on our financial position 
our liquidity position could affect our ability to bid on and accept projects  particularly where the project requires a letter of credit 
this could have a material adverse effect on our future results 
our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program on august   which authorized million for the repurchase of outstanding shares of our common stock over the next twelve month period 
approximately million shares of our stock were purchased in at a cost of approximately million  leaving approximately million remaining under the program 
as a result of the november  amendment to the revolving credit facility  we were prohibited from additional share repurchases 
the restriction against additional shares repurchases ended  effective june   as a result of our operating performance  however  no additional shares were repurchased under the plan before it ended on august  capital expenditures for are expected to be between million and million 
this range includes expenditures for the global  global  two new saturation diving systems  and various vessel upgrades 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate the divesture of assets that are no longer critical to operations to reduce operating costs and help preserve a solid financial position 
our long term liquidity will ultimately be determined by our ability to earn operating profits which are sufficient to cover our fixed costs  including scheduled principal and interest payments on debt  and to provide a reasonable return on shareholders investment 
our ability to earn operating profits in the long run will be determined by  among other things  the sustained viability of the oil and gas energy industry  commodity price expectations for crude oil and natural gas  the competitive environment of the markets in which we operate  and our ability to win bids and manage awarded projects to successful completion

asc does not change gaap  it introduces a new structure for organizing gaap and limits the hierarchy to two levels authoritative and nonauthoritative 
subsequent issuances of new standards will be in the form of accounting standards updates asu that will be included in asc 
asc is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after september  we adopted asc beginning on july  and the principal impact on our financial statements is limited to disclosures as all future references to authoritative accounting literature will be referenced in accordance with the codification 
in order to ease the transition to the codification  we are providing the codification cross reference alongside the references to the standards issued and adopted prior to the adoption of the codification 
sfas in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities asc topic 
this updated guidance requires an analysis to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
it also requires an ongoing reassessment and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining whether an entity is the primary beneficiary 
this update is codified in asu no 
and is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 subsequent events asc 
this guidance establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
this guidance is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june  we adopted this guidance beginning april  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures required by this guidance 
sfas in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities asc 
this guidance requires specific disclosures regarding the location and amounts of derivative instruments in our financial statements  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect our financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we adopted this guidance beginning january  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures required by this guidance 
asu no 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
which amends asc topic to add new disclosure requirements about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
it also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
this guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   except for the level reconciliation disclosures which are effective for reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
asu no 
in august  the fasb issued asu no 
which amends fair value measurements and disclosures overall asc topic to provide guidance on the fair value measurement of liabilities 
this update requires clarification for circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available 
a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the following techniques a valuation technique that uses either the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as an asset  or another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles in asc topic such as the income and market approach to valuation 
the amendment in this update also clarifies 
table of contents that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability 
this update further clarifies that if the fair value of a liability is determined by reference to a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability  that price would be considered a level measurement in the fair value hierarchy 
similarly  if the identical liability has a quoted price when traded as an asset in an active market  it is also a level fair value measurement if no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required 
we adopted this guidance beginning october  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures required by this guidance 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from construction contracts  which are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method  are measured by relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the current estimated total cost of the project the cost to cost option of the percentage of completion method 
the use of this method is based on our experience to be able to make reasonably dependable estimates of the cost to complete our projects 
total estimated costs are affected by operating efficiency  changes in expected cost of materials and labor  adverse market conditions  and other factors that could affect the timing of revenue recognition and or the overall profitability of a project 
significant changes in cost estimates could possibly result in a contract loss 
anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in full in the period in which they become evident 
in addition  we include claims and unapproved change orders  to the extent of costs incurred  in contract revenues when the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim  additional costs are not the result of deficiencies in our performance  costs are identifiable  and evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 
we actively negotiate our claims and change orders with our customers and the outcome of the negotiations has an impact on profitability of the project 
we continually monitor and assess the collectability of our contract revenues and receivables  and make the appropriate allowances when necessary 
receivables our receivables include billed and unbilled receivables  and often include claims and changes orders 
we recognize claims and unapproved change orders to the extent of costs incurred  and when we believe collection is probably and reasonably estimated 
we continually monitor and evaluate our receivables for collectability 
when we become aware of an uncollectible receivable  a specific reserve for bad debt expense is estimated and recorded  which reduces the receivable balance 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses 
property and equipment long lived assets held and used primarily marine vessels and related equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying values of an asset group can be recovered through projected net cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  based on expected operating results over the remaining life of the asset group 
the cash flow estimates are based on historical data adjusted for management estimates of future market performance that rely on existing market data  industry wide trends  and expected vessel day rates  utilization  and margins 
management s estimates may vary considerably from actual outcomes due to 
table of contents future adverse market conditions  poor operating results  or other factors that could result in our inability to recover the current carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we depreciate the majority of our vessels using the units of production method based on the estimated operating days of each vessel 
our depreciation expense calculated under the units of production method may be less than  equal to or greater than depreciation expense calculated under the straight line method in any period 
the annual depreciation based on estimated operating days of each vessel will be at least of annual straight line depreciation and of cumulative straight line depreciation 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our policy regarding depreciation 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired and is tested for impairment on an annual basis  on january or when circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
the carrying amount of goodwill as of december  and was approximately million  and is primarily attributable to our latin america segment 
income taxes deferred tax assets in excess of related valuation reserves require considerable judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
these estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
historically  changes to valuation allowances have been caused by major changes in the business cycle in certain countries and changes in local country law 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
we operate in many countries under various legal forms 
as a result  we are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and foreign tax authorities  as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments 
our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases actual income before taxes  deemed profits which are generally determined using a percentage of revenues rather than profits and withholding taxes based on revenue 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events  such as the amount  timing  and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law  and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restriction or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
a change in our effective tax rate would impact our net income by million 
our tax filings for various periods are subjected to audit by tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business 
these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts 
we believe that these assessments may occasionally be based on arbitrary and even erroneous interpretations of local tax law 
we have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals and or litigation regarding these matters 
we have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings 
we believe we have substantial defenses to the questions being raised and will pursue all legal remedies should an unfavorable outcome result 
however  resolution of these matters involves uncertainties  and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable 
in certain situations  we provide for taxes where assessments have not been received 
in those situations  we consider it more likely than not that the taxes ultimately payable will not exceed those amounts reflected in filed tax returns 
accordingly  taxes are provided in those situations under the current guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
future events  such as changes in the facts or tax law  judicial decisions regarding existing law or a favorable audit outcome  may later 
table of contents indicate the assertion of additional taxes is no longer more likely than not to occur 
in such circumstances  it is possible that taxes previously provided would be released 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk due to the international nature of our business operations and the interest rate fluctuation  we are exposed to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency risk most of our business operations are conducted in foreign countries that use different currencies 
as such  we use natural hedging techniques to manage the foreign exchange risks associated with our foreign operations by contracting  to the extent possible  international construction jobs to be payable in us dollars 
we continually monitor the foreign exchange risk associated with our foreign operations and will hedge these exposures when conditions warrant 
we also  to the extent possible  maintain cash balances at foreign locations in us dollar accounts 
we believe that a significant change in currency rates in the regions in which we operate could have a significant effect on our results of operations 
from time to time  we also make significant contractual commitments which are denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   we had significant contractual commitments which were denominated in norwegian kroners  singapore dollars  and euros 
we entered into forward foreign currency contracts  for non trading purposes  to mitigate our currency risk with respect to our contractual obligations denominated in norwegian kroners and singapore dollars  as further described 
our norwegian kroner commitments at december   which result from a long term vessel charter  will require the use of million kroners or million as of december  over the next two years 
as of december   we had hedged million of our non cancellable norwegian kroner commitments related to these vessel charters at an average rate of kroners per dollar 
consequently  a gain or loss from this forward foreign currency contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying commitment and  therefore would not have an impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
a increase in the value of the norwegian kroner at december  would have negligible impact on the value of the million unhedged portion of these commitments 
the estimated cost to complete capital expenditure projects in progress at december  will require an aggregate commitment of million singapore dollars or million as of december  
as of december   we had hedged million of these singapore dollar commitments at an average rate of singapore dollars per us dollar 
a increase in the value of the singapore dollar at december  will increase the dollar value of the remaining million unhedged commitments by approximately million 
as of december   we were committed to purchase certain equipment which will require the use of euros million or million as of december  over the next two years 
a increase in the value of the euro will increase the dollar value of these commitments by approximately million 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates with respect to our investments in cash equivalents and marketable securities 
our investments consist primarily of commercial paper  bank certificates of deposit  money market funds  and treasury securities 
we also continue to hold tax exempt auction rate debt securities 
these investments are subject to changes in short term interest rates 
we invest in high grade investments with a credit rating of aa aa or better  with a main objective of preserving capital 
a increase or decrease in the average interest rate of our cash equivalents and marketable securities would have an approximate million impact on our pre tax annualized interest income 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk on any borrowings against our revolving credit facility with variable interest rate provisions 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

table of contents our senior convertible debentures mature in and carry a fixed interest rate of  and our united states government guaranteed title xi ship financing bonds mature in and carry a fixed interest rate of 
changes in interest rates do not have an impact on the interest expense for this indebtedness
