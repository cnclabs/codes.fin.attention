item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations overview alexander s  inc nyse alx is a real estate investment trust reit  incorporated in delaware  engaged in leasing  managing  developing and redeveloping properties 
all references to we  us  our  company  and alexander s  refer to alexander s  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
we are managed by  and our properties are leased and developed by  vornado realty trust vornado nyse vno 
we have seven properties in the greater new york city metropolitan area 
we compete with a large number of property owners and developers 
our success depends upon  among other factors  trends of national and local economies  the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants  the availability and cost of capital  interest rates  construction and renovation costs  taxes  governmental regulations and legislation  population trends  zoning laws  and our ability to lease  sublease or sell our properties  at profitable levels 
our success is also subject to our ability to refinance existing debt as it comes due and on acceptable terms 
the economic recession and illiquidity and volatility in the financial and capital markets have negatively affected substantially all businesses  including ours 
demand for office and retail space has declined nationwide due to bankruptcies  downsizing  layoffs and cost cutting 
real estate transactions and development opportunities have diminished significantly and capitalization rates have risen 
these trends have negatively impacted our financial results during and it is not possible for us to quantify the impact of the above trends  which may continue in and beyond  on our future financial results

critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of our accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
this summary should be read in conjunction with a more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
real estate real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
as of december  and  the carrying amount of our real estate  net of accumulated depreciation  was  and  respectively 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
if we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
as real estate is undergoing development activities  all property operating expenses  including interest expense  are capitalized to the cost of the real property to the extent that we believe such costs are recoverable th rough the value of the property 
our properties  including any related intangible assets  are individually reviewed for impairment quarterly  if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over our anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis 
an impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property s carrying amount over its estimated fair value 
impairment analyses are based on our current plans  intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared 
if our estimates of the projected future cash flows  our anticipated holding period for properties  or the estimated fair value of properties change based on market conditions or otherwise  our evaluation of im pairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based  in part  on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results 
plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses 
allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants  including the receivable arising from the straight lining of rents  and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  and  as of december  and  respectively for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements 
we exercise judgment in establishing these allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
these estimates may differ from actual results  which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates continued revenue recognition we have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rent revenue arising from tenant leases these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis  which includes the effects of rent steps and free rent abatements under the leases 
we commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use 
in addition  in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant  we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
percentage rent revenue arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon the sales of tenants exceeding defined thresholds these rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie  the sales threshold has been achieved 
expense reimbursements revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective properties this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
parking income revenue arising from the rental of parking space at our properties this income is recognized as cash is received 
we assess  among other things  the collectibility of revenue before recognition 
if we incorrectly assess collectibility of revenue  net earnings and assets could be misstated 
income taxes we operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
as of december   there were approximately holders of record of our common stock 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit under the internal revenue code  we must distribute at least of our taxable income to shareholders 
because the balance of our net operating loss carryover nol has exceeded taxable income in the past  there was no distribution requirement 
in  we expect our taxable income to exceed the  remaining balance of our nol 
accordingly  we expect to pay a dividend in at an amount sufficient to meet the reit distribution requirement 
on september   our board of directors declared a special dividend of per share  or  in the aggregate  which was paid on october   to stockholders of record on october  the dividend was attributable to the liquidation of the wholly owned lexington avenue taxable reit subsidiary into alexander s 
prior to its liquidation on september   our wholly owned subsidiary  residential llc  was treated as a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
the trs was subject to income tax at regular corporate tax rates 
our nol were not available to offset taxable income of the trs 
in the year ended december   the trs paid  for income taxes 
under asc  income taxes  deferred income taxes would be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
however  deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence  including tax planning strategies and other factors 
as of december  and  there were no deferred tax assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
recently issued accounting literature on june   the fasb issued an update to asc  consolidation  which modifies the existing quantitative guidance used in determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie by requiring entities to qualitatively assess whether an enterprise is a primary beneficiary  based on whether the entity has i power over the significant activities of the vie  and ii an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the vie 
the adoption of this guidance on january  did not have any ef fect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued an update to asc  consolidation  which requires a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be identified in the consolidated financial statements 
it also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parent s ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation 
the amended guidance became effective on january  and resulted in i the reclassification of our minority interest in consol idated subsidiary to noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiary  a component of permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheets  and ii the reclassification of minority interest expense to net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest on our consolidated statements of operations 
in december  the fasb issued an update to asc  business combinations  which applies to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses 
it broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and interests transferred as a result of business combinations  and acquisition related costs will generally be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition 
the amended guidance also expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations 
the amended guidance becam e effective for all transactions entered into  on or after january  the adoption of this guidance on january   did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements

funds from operations ffo for the years ended december  and ffo is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
nareit defines ffo as gaap net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets and gaap extraordinary items  and to include depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified non cash items  including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
ffo and ffo per diluted share are used by management  investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales  which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate dimini shes predictably over time  rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity measure 
ffo may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies
