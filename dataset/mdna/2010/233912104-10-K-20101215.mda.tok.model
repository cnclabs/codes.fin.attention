item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company continues to operate as two different businesses the traditional business  being the business of newspaper and magazine publishing and related services that the company had before when it purchased sustain  and the sustain software business  which supplies case management software systems and related products to courts and other justice agencies  including administrative law organizations 
during fiscal  consolidated pretax income decreased by  to  from  in the prior year 
the company s traditional business segment pretax profit increased by  to  from  primarily because of an increase in the number of trustee foreclosure notices that were published in the company s newspapers and a decrease in costs and expenses 
sustain s business segment had a pretax loss of  compared to a pretax profit of  in the prior year because of a decrease in consulting revenues from governmental agencies 
reportable segments total results traditional business sustain for both segments fiscal revenues pretax income loss income tax benefit expense net income loss fiscal revenues pretax income income tax expense net income consolidated revenues were  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
this decrease of  was primarily from decreases of  in display advertising revenues   in classified advertising revenues   in sustain consulting revenues and  in circulation revenues  partially offset by an increase in public notice advertising revenues of  the company continued to benefit from the large number of foreclosures in california and arizona for which public notice advertising is required by law 
sustain s information systems and services revenues decreased by  primarily because of the decrease in consulting revenues 
the company s revenues derived from sustain s operations constituted about and of the company s total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the company s smaller newspapers  those other than the los angeles and san francisco daily journals the daily journals  accounted for about of the total public notice advertising revenues 
public notice advertising revenues and related advertising and other service fees constituted about of the company s total revenues 
advertising service fees and other are traditional business segment revenues  which include primarily i agency commissions received from outside newspapers in which the advertising is placed and ii fees generated when filing notices with government agencies 
the daily journals accounted for about of the company s total circulation revenues 
the court rule and judicial profile services generated about of the total circulation revenues  with the other newspapers and services accounting for the balance 
costs and expenses decreased by  to  from  total personnel costs decreased by  to  primarily due to savings from departmental reorganizations  partially offset by an annual salary adjustment 
outside services decreased by  primarily resulting from reduced computer programming services 
newsprint and printing expenses decreased by  primarily resulting from fewer subscribers  partially offset by an increase in the price of paper 
postage and delivery expenses decreased by  mainly because there were fewer subscribers 
the company s expenditures for the development of new sustain software products are significant and will materially impact overall results at least through fiscal these costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility of the product has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized  subject to expected recovery 
sustain s internal development costs  which are primarily incremental costs for both employees and outside contractors  aggregated  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
if sustain s internal development programs are not successful  they will significantly and adversely impact the company s ability to maximize its existing investment in the sustain software  to service its existing custom ers and to compete for new opportunities in the case management software business 
whether the increase in traditional business segment pretax profit will be sustained throughout fiscal is very much dependant on the number of california and arizona foreclosure notices and the offsetting effect of a continuing decline in commercial advertising and subscriptions 
the number of foreclosure notices decreased by during the three month period ended september  as compared to the prior year comparable period 
because this slowing is expected to continue  we anticipate there will be fewer foreclosure notice advertisements and declining business segment earnings in fiscal we do not expect to experience an offsetting increase in commercial advertising as a result of this trend because of the continuing challenges in the commercial advertising business 
 sustain s consulting revenues  which are subject to uncertainty because they depend on i the timing of the acceptance of the completed consulting tasks  ii the unpredictable needs of sustain s existing customers  and iii sustain s ability to secure new customers  have declined substantially in fiscal because many governments have reduced their budgets for services like those provided by sustain 
on a pretax profit of  and  for fiscal and  the company recorded a tax provision of  and  respectively  which was somewhat lower than the amount computed using the statutory rate because of the available dividends received deduction and the domestic production activity deduction 
consequently  the company s effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
the company files federal income tax returns in the united states and with various state jurisdictions and is no longer subject to examinations for years before as well as for years and with regards to federal income taxes 
the internal revenue service has been examining the tax returns for years to and has prop osed an assessment that  if upheld  would result in disallowance of about  of previously claimed research and development credits 
as of september   the company had approximately  of unrecognized tax benefits  all of which would have an effective rate impact if recognized 
the company is continuing to contest the issue in the united states tax court  and the ultimate resolution of this dispute cannot be ascertained at this time 
net income per share decreased to from 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company s cash and cash equivalents  us treasury and marketable security positions increased by  in february  the company took advantage of near panic selling in the stock market and redeployed some of its cash  which had been invested in treasury securities and was generating only nominal interest  to purchase the common stock of two fortune companies and certain bonds of a third 
so far  these investments have been very successful  although the unrealized gains are lower now than they were at september  as of september   there were unrealized gains of  as compared to  at september   almost all of which were in the common stocks 
the cash provided by operating activities of  included a net decrease in deferred subscription and other revenues of  proceeds from the sale of subscriptions from newspapers  court rule books and other publications and for software licenses and maintenance and other services are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in earned revenue only when the services are rendered 
cash flows from operating activities increased by  during fiscal as compared to the prior year primarily resulting from a decrease in accounts receivable of  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of  as of september   the company had working capital of  including the liability for deferred subscription and other revenues of  which are scheduled to be earned within one year and the deferred tax liability of  for the unrealized gains described above 
the company believes that it will be able to fund its operations for the foreseeable future through its cash flows from operating activities and its current working capital and expects that any such cash flows will be invested in its two businesses or used to repurchase its common stock 
the company also may entertain business acquisition opportunities 
any excess cash flows will be invested as management and the board of directors deem appropriate at the time 
such investments may include additional securities of the companies in which the company has already invested  securities of other companies  government securities including us treasury notes and bills or other instruments 
the decision as to particular investments will be driven by the company s belief about the risk reward profile of the various investment choices at the time  and it may utilize government securities as a default if attractive opportunities for a better return are not available 
the company s chairman of the board  charles munger  is also the vice chairman of berkshire hathaway inc  which maintains a substantial investment portfolio 
the company s board of directors utilized his judgment and suggestions  as well as those of jp guerin  the c ompany s vice chairman  when selecting the investments that were made last year  and both of them will continue to play an important role in monitoring those investments and selecting any future investments 
as noted above  however  the investments are concentrated in just three companies 
accordingly  a significant decline in the market value of one or more of the company s investments may not be offset by the hypothetically better performance of other investments  and that could result in a large decrease in the company s stockholders equity and  under certain circumstances  in the recognition of losses in the company s income statement 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
management believes that revenue recognition  accounting for capitalized software costs and income taxes are critical accounting policies 
the company recognizes revenues from both the lease and sale of software products 
revenues from leases of software products are recognized over the life of the lease while revenues from software product sales are recognized normally upon delivery  installation or acceptance pursuant to a signed agreement 
revenues from annual maintenance contracts generally call for the company to provide software updates and upgrades to customers and are recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
consulting and other services are recognized as performed or upon acceptance by the customers 
proceeds from the sale of subscriptions for newspapers  court rule books and other publications and other services are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in earned revenue only when the servi ces are provided  generally over the subscription or lease term 
advertising revenues are recognized when advertisements are published and are net of commissions 
accounting standards codification asc  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  provides that costs related to the research and development of a new software product are to be expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product is established 
accordingly  costs related to the development of new sustain software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized  subject to expected recoverability 
in general  technological feasibility is achieved when the developer has established the necessary skills  hardware and technology to produce a product and a detailed pr ogram design has been a completed  b traced to the product specifications and c reviewed for high risk development issues 
asc  income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes
