item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we are a canadian corporation  with principal assets and operations in the united states  whose primary business is developing  manufacturing and selling our nano lithium titanate battery cells  batteries and battery packs and providing related design  installation and test services 
our primary focus is marketing our large scale energy storage solutions to power companies and electric grid operators throughout the world 
in addition  we market our batteries to electric and hybrid electric bus manufacturers 
in our strategic review we determined that the specific strategic efforts we should focus on going forward are the provision of frequency regulation and renewables integration in the electric grid  the electrification of the mass transit portion of the automotive market  and similar opportunities in the military market where we can leverage the specific application to support our overall technology development efforts 
we believe that these are multi billion dollar emerging markets with room for a number of successful suppliers 
at the present time  we perceive no dominant provider and we believe that as a result of our significant differentiated product attributes  the overall strength of our management team  and the recognition we are receiving in the marketplace  that we have a very good chance of becoming one of the successful suppliers 
our proprietary technology platform gives our products a number of unique  highly sought after attributes that clearly differentiate our products from their alternatives 
included in these attributes are substantially longer cycle and calendar lives  a rapid recharge time  the ability to provide instantaneous high power  a wide operating temperature range and increased operational safety 
has been a transition year as we have discontinued the pursuit of grants and contracts in the life sciences and performance materials markets to focus on the power and energy systems market 
we expect that the first half of will continue in this transition mode until we start to gain traction in the sale of our various battery products 
although we had excellent research and a number of prototype battery products in early  there is still considerable work required on our part to turn these promising prototypes into commercially available products 
that work continued in earnest throughout  and we are now in a position to actively sell our products 
future revenues will depend on the success of these efforts  the results of our other research and development work  and the success of spectrum pharmaceuticals in the further development and market introduction of products based on renazorbtm and renalantm for which we will receive future milestone and royalty payments 
we also provide contract research services on select projects where we can utilize our resources to develop intellectual property and or new products and technology 
although contract services revenue comprised a significant portion of our total revenues in recent years accounting for   and  respectively in  and  we expect this percentage to diminish as our battery sales expand 
our revenues have been  and we expect them to continue to be  generated by license fees  product sales  commercial collaborations  and government contracts and grants 
we currently have agreements in place to provide research to further develop battery electrode materials and nanosensors  participate in a joint venture combining the technologies of the partners in order to develop and produce titanium dioxide pigment for use in a variety of applications  although we are actively working with sherwin williams to sell our interests in this joint venture  develop a suite of energy storage solutions for the stationary power market  develop battery backup power systems for naval applications  and provide battery modules to a us based bus manufacturer 
we have made product sales consisting principally of battery packs and nano lithium titanate cells 
general outlook we have generated net losses in each fiscal year since incorporation 
revenues from commercial collaborations and contracts and grants decreased million from million in to million in we completed most of our customer collaboration and grant related projects during and did not seek to renew them  with the major exception being the us office of naval research work 
revenue from product sales increased modestly from  in to  in as we began to shift our focus out of the low margin grants and customer collaborations opportunities into product sales 
our current focus is on the development of products in energy storage that we anticipate will eventually bring a substantial amount of higher margin revenues from product sales 
we expect our nano lithium titanate batteries to be the source of such higher margin revenues 
consequently  during  we continued to expand the scope of our power and energy group by hiring additional staff and increasing temporary personnel to handle the conversion from a prototype to a commercial product  adding additional sales and marketing personnel to focus on this market  and acquiring test and production equipment 
as we attempt to significantly expand our revenues from licensing  manufacturing  sales and other sources  some of the key near term events that will affect our long term success prospects include the following based on the success of the aes mw frequency regulation trial  as validated in the kema  inc analysis and report  we have experienced a substantial amount of interest in the product from other entities and are in active sales development discussions with a number of them 
in august   we signed a contract with proterra  llc  a golden  colorado based leading designer and manufacturer of heavy duty drive systems  energy storage systems  vehicle control systems and transit buses to sell them battery modules for their all electric and hybrid electric buses 
proterra s systems are scalable to all forms of commercial buses and class trucks 
as they continue to scale their business we anticipate developing a mutually beneficial long term relationship with them 
based on the demonstrated success of our battery in the proterra bus application  we have also entered into discussions with a number of other bus manufacturers or systems integrators regarding the purchase of our battery products for their respective applications 
our efforts with the us military and the british ministry of defense continue to move forward on several different projects 
initial testing phases on each project with the us army  us navy and the british ministry of defense have all completed and ongoing government funding for for the us navy is already in place 
although the results of the work done in the other areas were equally well received  ongoing work is dependent on government funding in each country 
with the overall state of the economy still being very weak  this funding is uncertain at the current time 
spectrum is continuing its product development work and pre clinical testing with the intention of filing an investigational new drug application with the us food and drug administration in during  altairnano assisted spectrum in selection of a third party manufacturer of the renazorbtm and renalantm active pharmaceutical ingredient 
spectrum continues to enlist altairnano analytical resources for development work 
pre clinical trial work still lies ahead for the renazorbtm based drugs 
although it is not essential that all of these projects be successful in order to permit substantial long term revenue growth  we believe that full commercialization of several of our battery applications will be necessary in order to expand our revenues enough to create a likelihood of our becoming profitable in the long term 
we remain optimistic with respect to our current key projects  as well as others we are pursuing  but recognize that  with respect to each  there are development  marketing  partnering and other risks to be overcome 
an important consideration as we begin to grow our revenue stream is to ensure that we have access to the various components and raw material we need to manufacture and then assemble our various products 
with a small product volume  having multiple suppliers for each component is not practical  but is now becoming much more important to us 
during  we began to identify and qualify additional suppliers or manufacturers for our critical components 
while those efforts have progressed  the most critical sole source relationship we currently have is for the manufacture of our battery cells 
we currently have one supplier that produces all of our battery cells 
these cells include our proprietary nano lithium titanate material produced in reno  nevada 
our supplier delivers battery cells to our anderson  indiana manufacturing facility 
we then manufacture battery packs used in electric buses and also manufacture complete megawatt scale energy storage solutions for the electric grid markets 
this battery cell supplier is critical to our manufacturing process 
we are currently seeking to establish supply agreements with other sources of battery cell manufacturing 
we expect to have an agreement with a second battery cell supplier by the end of we are currently experiencing a quality issue with the critical cell manufacturing supplier described above that has impacted our immediate ability to supply product to our customers 
we are in active discussions with this supplier to identify the root cause of the problem and rectify it 
the items in question are under warranty and although we do not expect a material financial impact  the delay in the problem rectification  if it continues for an extended period  may have an adverse impact on the delivery of our products during the first half of our operating divisions for nearly all of  we were organized into two divisions a power and energy group and an all other division 
during  we operated as three separate divisions  including a performance materials division and a life sciences division in addition to the power and energy group 
based on the results of a comprehensive review of all the company s activities  strengths  weaknesses  competitive opportunities and the overall market that was conducted during  a decision was made to focus the company s future efforts primarily in the power and energy arena 
as a result  efforts began in late and early to eliminate or sell the company s assets and efforts in the life sciences and performance materials divisions 
as of december   we have ceased all operations in the life sciences area and the assets formerly dedicated to that market either redeployed into the power and energy group or are planned to be disposed of 
there is still a small amount of residual work being done in the performance materials market to fulfill commitments with existing customers  but these efforts require a minimal level of resources 
we are also taking steps to dispose of our interest in the alsher titania joint venture  including seeking a new partner to fund the next stage of development and we are in negotiations with sherwin williams with respect to their potential acquisition of our interest in alsher titania llc 
while we continue to service existing customers and agreements relating to other types of our previously developed products  our research and development  production and marketing efforts are now focused solely on the power and energy group 
liquidity and capital resources current and expected liquidity as of december   we had cash and short term investments totaling million 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in operating activities for compared to primarily reflects payments of approximately million relating to certain significant payments we made in the first quarter of  which included million of commission and expenses paid to the placement agent in connection with our sale of common shares in november  million paid in connection with the bonus plan  and million of raw materials purchases made in in anticipation of receipt of the next sales order from phoenix under the purchase agreement were paid in the first quarter of cash expended on research and development activities decreased by approximately million in the first quarter of primarily attributable to the completion of customer contracts and grants in aes energy storage llc  elanco animal health  and the department of energy and the realignment of resources relating to the shift in focus from the performance materials and life sciences segments to the power and energy group 
additionally  no bonus payments were made in the first quarter of  as the bonus targets for were not achieved 
in may  we completed a sale of  common shares of the company for net proceeds to the company of million 
in july  we sold our  shares of spectrum pharmaceutical common stock for cash proceeds of million 
these items plus other smaller cash inflows related to notes payable  interest  long term debt and other items increased cash by a total of million 
over the long term  we anticipate substantially increasing revenues by entering into new contracts and increasing product sales in the stationary power and electric bus markets 
however  this increase in revenues will be dependent on our ability to transition our stationary power products from prototypes into commercial grade products 
during  we continued making significant expenditures for our battery initiative  added staff and equipment for the manufacture of nano lithium titanate products and increased our sales and marketing efforts 
in  we intend to increase spending on our battery initiatives continuing the enhancement of our products and their conversion into commercial grade products 
we estimate that our current cash and short term investments balance is sufficient to support our operations well into based on budgeted cash flow projections 
however  it will not be sufficient to carry the company to our projected cash flow breakeven point expected in considering this fact we will most likely attempt to raise additional cash during depending upon the size and timing of future orders  we believe that this additional capital would enable the company to reach its cash flow breakeven point and become cash self sustaining 
investing activities for the year ended december  reflect the purchase of property and equipment of  compared to property and equipment purchases of million made for the year ended december  capital expenditures of approximately million are anticipated through december based on the anticipated increased sales and production volumes 
our cash and short term investments decreased by million  from million at december  to million at december   due primarily to net proceeds from our may common stock sale and other financing activities of million plus the sale of our spectrum pharmaceuticals stock for million offset by net cash used in operations of million and purchases of property and equipment of million the use of cash for financing activities of  excluding the may financing for the year ended december  primarily reflects the payment of the note payable on our building of  the final payment of  on this note was due  and paid  in january during the second half of we built up our inventory in anticipation of sales expected in late and early however  we experienced fewer orders than expected due to various economic and political factors  including decisions by many companies to defer battery technology projects while waiting for responses on government grant applications related to the american recovery and reinvestment act of based on the increased level of sales quote activity we have seen of late  however  it appears that companies are returning to a more normal mode of business in which projects are evaluated on their own merits 
as we move into  we do not expect to build up our inventory much more than its current level until we begin to close sales 
with regard to inventory decisions  we also consider the lengthy manufacturing cycle of four to six months required to produce our large battery systems 
depending on the time lag between the initial inventory buildup and the actual sales  our cash balance will be negatively impacted 
since actual sales and production volumes for the full year of are unknown at this time  we are not able to currently estimate our anticipated inventory purchases through december  we expect that we will end  however  with an overall inventory level in the same range as we ended liquidity will be a consideration in our final determination of production volumes 
our objective is to manage cash expenditures in a manner consistent with rapid product development that leads to the generation of revenues in the shortest possible time 
our shift in focus to the power and energy group and reduction in resources committed to our other business units has allowed us to re direct funding to our battery development and commercialization activities  which are anticipated to be higher margin with a shorter cycle to commercialization than our performance materials and pharmaceutical candidates 
we do not believe that this shift in focus will have a material effect on our sources of cash 
our cash outflow in the life sciences and performance materials markets was considerably greater than our cash inflow 
historically  we have financed operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities common shares  convertible debentures  stock options and warrants and by the issuance of debt 
depending upon the growth rate of our battery revenues  we will most likely need to raise additional capital to fund this growth during we do not have any commitments with respect to future financing and may or may not  be able to obtain such financing on reasonable terms  or at all 
consistent with past practice  we expect that this type of financing will continue to provide us with the working capital required until anticipated order volume increases allow us to reach cash flow breakeven 
if order volume fails to increase as currently anticipated  we estimate that at our average net cash burn rate of million per month  capital for approximately months is available excluding any new business 
under this scenario  if no customer orders are received by mid  purchases of raw materials would be discontinued and other measures to conserve cash would be implemented as necessary to extend cash availability 
included in our cash expenditures was an increase in our inventory levels of million 
other measures to preserve cash on hand until order volume begins to increase would include the following reducing production levels and purchases of raw materials  deferring discretionary expenditures such as capital purchases  internal research costs  training  and routine equipment and building maintenance  eliminating or deferring filling non critical positions through attrition  and reductions in workforce 
as we project forward for the next months  if sales volume growth is slow and steady and we continue our existing model of shipping our nano lithium titanate to our current contract manufacturer who manufactures our battery cells and then ships them to our anderson  indiana facility for assembly into our final products  we will need to raise additional capital during to carry us to cash flow breakeven anticipated in on the other hand  if volume growth is relatively fast as the global economy starts to improve  we will need also to raise additional capacity expansion capital earlier in order to fulfill the higher demand 
if we change our existing model with respect to the manufacture of our battery cells  we may need a larger capital investment to fund the building of that capability in house 
since we are in the process of commercializing our products in newly emerging markets and our growth estimates may vary based on the economic recovery  our historical cash flows are not a good indicator of our future requirements 
we evaluate our capital needs and the availability of capital on an ongoing basis and  consistent with past practice  expect to seek capital when and on such terms as we deem appropriate based upon our assessment of our current liquidity  capital needs and the availability of capital 
given that we are not yet in a positive cash flow or earnings position  the options available to us are fewer than to a positive cash flow company 
specifically  we would not generally qualify for long term institutional debt financing 
we do not have any commitments from any party to provide required capital and may or may not  be able to obtain such capital on reasonable terms 
consistent with past practice we expect to raise additional capital through the sale of common shares  convertible notes  stock options  and warrants 
we do not expect the current difficult economic environment to preclude our ability to raise capital  but the overall cost to the company of doing so will most likely be higher 
we had a single note payable in the original principal amount of million secured by a first lien on our building 
the final payment of principal and interest was due on february  and paid on january capital commitments and expenditures the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and the periods in which payments are due as of december  in thousands of dollars less than after contractual obligations total year years years years notes payable interest on notes payable contractual service agreements property and capital leases unfulfilled purchase orders total contractual obligations in and  we upgraded our enterprise resource planning and accounting systems to support our anticipated growth and to give our operating personnel the timely information they need to make business decisions 
we spent  in and  in on these systems 
implementation was completed in july in july  we signed a new lease agreement for  square feet of space in the flagship business accelerator building located at enterprise drive  anderson  indiana 
on march   we signed an addendum to this lease that increased the space leased by  square feet 
the move from the former office and laboratory space leased in the flagship enterprise center building to the accelerator building was completed by late february we have spent approximately  on build out and leasehold improvements during and an additional  in we purchased equipment for our reno  nevada and anderson  indiana facilities for use in the development and expansion of our current advanced battery materials production capabilities 
through december   approximately million was expended on lab and production equipment 
an additional million was spent on upgrading office equipment and software to support these efforts 
depending upon the speed of our revenue growth in  we plan to spend approximately million on production and tooling equipment associated with our power and energy group capacity expansion 
this level of expenditures assumes that we will continue to rely on a contract manufacturer to manufacture our cells 
should we change this model and decide to manufacture the cells ourselves  a much higher level of capital investment would be required to build a cell manufacturing capability here in the us the size of this investment would be dependent upon the size of the facility required and to what extent we could use existing available space in our current locations 
off balance sheet arrangements the company did not have any off balance sheet transactions during critical accounting policies and estimates management based the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to long lived assets  share based compensation  revenue recognition  overhead allocation  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory  and deferred income tax 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
changes to these judgments and estimates could adversely affect the company s future results of operations and cash flows 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist principally of the nanomaterials and titanium dioxide pigment assets  the intellectual property patents and patent applications associated with them  and a building 
included in these long lived assets are those that relate to our research and development process 
if the assets have alternative future uses in research and development projects or otherwise  they are capitalized when acquired or constructed  if they do not have alternative future uses  they are expensed as incurred 
at december   the carrying value of these assets was million  or of total assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value 
our estimate of the cash flows is based on the information available at the time including the following internal budgets  sales forecasts  customer trends  anticipated production volumes  and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining useful life of the asset which may range from to years for most equipment and up to years for our building and related building improvements 
if an impairment is indicated  the asset value is written to its fair value based upon market prices  or if not available  upon discounted cash flow value  at an appropriate discount determined by us to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the business model 
the determination of both undiscounted and discounted cash flows requires us to make significant estimates and consider the expected course of action at the balance sheet date 
our assumptions about future sales and production volumes require significant judgment because actual sales prices and volumes have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to continue to do so 
until our products reach commercialization  the demand for our products is difficult to estimate 
subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted and discounted cash flows arising from changes in anticipated actions could impact the determination of whether an impairment exists  the amount of the impairment charge recorded and whether the effects could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
events or circumstances that could indicate the existence of a possible impairment include obsolescence of the technology  an absence of market demand for the product or the assets used to produce it  a history of operating or cash flow losses and or the partial or complete lapse of technology rights protection 
as a result of management s determination to focus on the power and energy segment of the business and reduce resources committed to performance materials and life sciences  in combination with the delays experienced in commercializing our products  the following qualitative reviews were performed regarding our patents and fixed assets in addition to an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if our long lived assets are impaired o our chief technology officer reviewed and confirmed that the capitalized patents of  relating to processing titanium dioxide and pigment have not been impaired 
these patents are also the underlying basis for production of our nano lithium titanate  which is utilized as the anode material in our battery products in the power and energy segment 
nano lithium titanate is a fundamental building block of our batteries  we do not see these patents value being impaired unless we are unable to commercialize our battery products 
we believe this outcome is unlikely 
o detailed review of the remaining performance materials fixed assets of  was performed with operations management to understand the purpose  use  and potential disposition of these fixed assets 
based on this detailed review  it was determined that the assets which consist primarily of production assets such as mills  furnaces and laboratory equipment suited for general use in our business would be re purposed to the power and energy segment to support the anticipated growth in sales volume within the next two years 
these assets are expected to have in service lives at least equal to their depreciation lives and with reasonable ongoing maintenance are expected to continue functioning throughout that period 
if we are unable to commercialize our battery products  the value of these assets could be impaired  but we believe this outcome is unlikely 
o detailed review of the life sciences fixed assets with a net book value of million was performed with operations management to understand the purpose  use  and potential disposition of these fixed assets 
the assets relating to this segment are primarily building improvements that expand production and lab areas 
it was determined that these improvements do add to the value of the building and the space and will be required for the expansion of power and energy operations based on anticipated growth in sales volume within the next two years 
failure to commercialize our battery products and a significant drop in real estate values could lead to impairment of these assets 
we believe that the occurrence of such events is unlikely 
o fixed assets held by our joint venture with sherwin williams  alsher titania llc  of million  previously included in the performance materials segment  were also evaluated 
although we are currently continuing to work with sherwin williams to identify and qualify an interested third party to purchase our interest in the alsher titania joint venture these assets have been idled for most of in assessing potential outcomes  it is our judgment that the most likely one is for the alsher assets to be unwanted by a potential buyer  if one is found 
we would be able to use some of these assets in its power and energy group  and the rest would be sold for scrap 
accordingly we determined that these assets were impaired  and a million valuation reserve has been reflected in our december financials to bring the alsher titania assets net book value down to market value of  as of december   we estimate that our future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  are greater than our million in long lived assets 
our estimated future cash flows include anticipated product sales  commercial collaborations  and contracts and grant revenue  since our long lived asset base  which is primarily composed of production  laboratory and testing equipment and our reno facility  is utilized to fulfill contracts in all revenue categories 
based on our assessment  which represents no change from the prior year in our approach to valuing long lived assets  and after writing down the alsher assets mentioned above  we believe that our long lived assets are not impaired 
stock based compensation 
we have a stock incentive plan that provides for the issuance of stock options  restricted stock and other awards to employees and service providers 
we calculate compensation expense using a black scholes merton option pricing model 
in so doing  we estimate certain key assumptions used in the model 
we believe the estimates we use  which are presented in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  are appropriate and reasonable 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been performed  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable 
during  our revenues were derived from three sources product sales  commercial collaborations  and contract research and development 
license fees are recognized when the agreement is signed  we have performed all material obligations related to the particular milestone payment or other revenue component and the earnings process is complete 
revenue for product sales is recognized upon delivery of the product  unless specific contractual terms dictate otherwise 
based on the specific terms and conditions of each contract grant  revenues are recognized on a time and materials basis  a percentage of completion basis and or a completed contract basis 
revenue under contracts based on time and materials is recognized at contractually billable rates as labor hours and expenses are incurred 
revenue under contracts based on a fixed fee arrangement is recognized based on various performance measures  such as stipulated milestones 
as these milestones are achieved  revenue is recognized 
from time to time  facts develop that may require us to revise our estimated total costs or revenues expected 
the cumulative effect of revised estimates is recorded in the period in which the facts requiring revisions become known 
the full amount of anticipated losses on any type of contract is recognized in the period in which it becomes known 
payments received in advance relating to future performance of services or delivery of products  are deferred until the customer accepts the service or the product title transfers to our customer 
upfront payments received in connection with certain rights granted in contractual arrangements are deferred and amortized over the related time period over which the benefits are received 
based on specific customer bill and hold agreements  revenue is recognized when the inventory is shipped to a third party storage warehouse  the inventory is segregated and marked as sold  the customer takes the full rights of ownership and title to the inventory upon shipment to the warehouse per the bill and hold agreement 
when contract terms include multiple components that are considered separate units of accounting  the revenue is attributed to each component and revenue recognition may occur at different points in time for product shipment  installation  and service contracts based on substantial completion of the earnings process 
accrued warranty 
we provide a limited warranty for battery packs and energy storage systems 
a liability is recorded for estimated warranty obligations at the date products are sold 
since these are new products  the estimated cost of warranty coverage is based on cell and module life cycle testing and compared for reasonableness to warranty rates on competing battery products 
as sufficient actual historical data is collected on the new product  the estimated cost of warranty coverage will be adjusted accordingly 
the liability for estimated warranty obligations may also be adjusted based on specific warranty issues identified 
overhead allocation 
facilities overheads  which are comprised primarily of occupancy and related expenses  and fringe benefit expenses  are initially recorded in general and administrative expenses and then allocated monthly to research and development expense based on labor costs 
facilities overheads and fringe benefits allocated to research and development projects may be chargeable when invoicing customers under certain research and development contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
we analyze historical bad debts  the aging of customer accounts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
from period to period  differences in judgments or estimates utilized may result in material differences in the amount and timing of our bad debt expenses 
inventory 
we value our inventories generally at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we employ a full absorption procedure using standard cost techniques 
the standards are customarily reviewed and adjusted annually 
overhead rates are recorded to inventory based on normal capacity 
any idle facility costs or excessive spoilage are recorded as current period charges 
deferred income tax 
income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
future tax benefits are subject to a valuation allowance when management is unable to conclude that its deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realized from the results of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred income tax assets that may not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on the historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets become deductible  management believes it more likely than not that the company will not realize benefits of these deductible differences as of december  management has  therefore  established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred income tax assets as of december  due to the significant increase in common shares issued and outstanding from through  section of the internal revenue code may provide significant limitations on the utilization of our net operating loss carry forwards 
as a result of these limitations  a portion of these loss and credit carryovers may expire without being utilized 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain selected  unaudited  condensed consolidated financial data for the periods indicated 
altair nanotechnologies inc 
and subsidiaries consolidated statements of operations expressed in thousands of united states dollars unaudited power and energy group all other corporate consolidated year ended year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  december  revenues product sales less sales returns license fees commercial collaborations contracts and grants total revenues operating expenses cost of sales product cost of sales warranty and inventory reserves research and development sales and marketing notes receivable extinguishment settlement and release asset impairment general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense interest expense interest income realized gain loss on investment loss on foreign exchange total other expense income  net net loss less net loss attributable to non controlling interest net loss attributable to altair nanotechnologies inc fiscal year vs 
revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for power and energy group revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for this decrease is attributable to our shift from lower margin contracts and grants revenues partially offset by higher product sales and commercial collaboration revenues  primarily with electric bus manufacturer proterra  llc 
contracts and grants revenue was down million from to this was due primarily to the completion of the onr i contract in november and the ramp up of the onr ii contract in starting in june all other revenues for the year ended december  were down  from million in this net decrease was primarily from million in reduced commercial collaboration revenue from several customers  netted with a  one time license fee revenue from spectrum pharmaceuticals in operating expenses power and energy group cost of sales product increased  in the power and energy group 
these costs were associated with the production ramp up of our nano lithium titanate raw material production in reno  nevada and battery module production in anderson  indiana 
power and energy group cost of sales warranty and inventory reserves increased from a credit of million in to  in expense in the  million credit in resulted from an agreement effective july with phoenix motor cars  whereby the purchase and supply agreement was terminated and the parties resolved all outstanding issues with respect to the warranty associated with the battery packs sold in the  expense includes a  inventory valuation allowance primarily associated with the cell manufacture issue previously described 
total research and development expense decreased by million  or  from million in to million power and energy group costs decreased million associated with the completion of grant work in research and development costs for all other operations decreased by million attributable to a shift in focus and realignment of resources from life sciences and performance materials to the battery production arena 
the corporate segment research and development expenses primarily reflect the personnel and operating costs associated with our science and technology group which supports the company s overall research and development efforts 
notes receivable extinguishment expense of million in relates to an agreement effective july with phoenix motorcars  whereby all accounts receivable and notes receivable relating to the purchase and supply agreement were cancelled 
settlement and release expense of million in resulted from a settlement agreement with al yousuf llc related to claims associated with their november investment in the company 
asset impairment of million in is a result of an impairment charge to adjust alsher assets to their fair market value as of december  sherwin williams is seeking outside financing to continue this business 
we evaluated the different possibilities of outcome for alsher as of december   determined that these assets were impaired

the sales cycle  associated with sales of our stationary power batteries for use in providing ancillary services over power grids  has turned out to be longer than originally anticipated resulting in the slower ramp up of revenue from that revenue channel
