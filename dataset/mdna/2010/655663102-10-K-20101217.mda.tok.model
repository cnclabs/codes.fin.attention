item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations note regarding amounts and fiscal year references in this annual report  all amounts related to united states dollars and foreign currency and to the number of nordson corporation s common shares  except for per share earnings and dividend amounts  are expressed in thousands 
unless otherwise noted  all references to years relate to our fiscal year ending october critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
on a regular basis  critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition most of our revenues are recognized upon shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements  such as those including installation or other services  are recognized as each element is earned based on objective evidence of the relative fair value of each element 
if the installation or other services are inconsequential to the functionality of the delivered product  the entire amount of revenue is recognized upon satisfaction of the criteria noted above 
inconsequential installation or other services are those that can generally be completed in a short period of time  at insignificant cost  and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to us 
if installation or other services are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  revenues attributable to these obligations are deferred until completed 
amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue within accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets 
revenues deferred in  and were not material 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level  or more often if indications of impairment exist 
for and  our reporting units are the adhesive dispensing systems segment  the industrial coating systems segment and one level below the advanced technology systems segment 
reporting units in the advanced technology systems segment in are consistent with those used in  except that picodostec and yestech are now included in the efd and dage reporting units  respectively 

table of contents the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
in the first step  performed in the fourth quarter of each year  we calculate a reporting unit s fair value using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology and compare the result against the reporting unit s carrying value of net assets 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired 
in step one  the assumptions used for discounted cash flow  revenue growth  operating margin  and working capital turnover are based on general management s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends 
terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the gordon growth model method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital methodology wacc and growth rate 
for each reporting unit  sensitivity calculations vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of assurance that our expected assumptions are fair for detecting impairment 
discount rates were developed using a wacc methodology 
the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors 
for  the discount rates used ranged from percent to percent depending upon the reporting unit s size  end market volatility  and projection risk 
the calculated internal rate of return for the step one consolidated valuation was percent  the same as the calculated wacc for total nordson 
to test the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow valuations  we performed the control premium test  which compares the sum of the fair values calculated for our reporting units net of debt to the market value of equity 
the control premium was percent as of the test date of july  and negative percent as of our year end of october  these comparisons indicated that the discounted cash flow valuation was reasonable 
in addition  indications of value derived for each reporting unit using the market approach reconciled reasonably with the results of the discounted cash flow approach 
in  the results of our step one testing indicated no impairment  therefore  the second step of impairment testing was not necessary 
in  we determined that the second step of impairment testing was necessary 
in the second step  a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities is performed using the fair value calculated in step one 
the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the hypothetical fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied goodwill amount 
impairment is recorded if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is higher than its implied goodwill 
based upon the results of our impairment testing  we recognized an impairment charge for a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill in the amount of  relating to six reporting units as follows dage  picodostec  yestech  march plasma systems  uv curing  and industrial coating systems  the excess of fair value fv over carrying value cv was compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit 
based on the results shown in the table below  our conclusion is that no indicators of impairment exist 
potential events or circumstances resulting in a negative effect to the estimated fair value could range from a further downturn in global economies to a much slower recovery than assumed 
excess of wacc fv over cv goodwill adhesive dispensing asymtek efd dage and yestech 
table of contents indefinite lived intangible assets indefinite lived intangible assets are trademarks and trade names associated with dage  picodostec and yestech 
these assets are not subject to amortization and must be tested for impairment annually or more often if indications of impairment exist 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
after an impairment charge is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of the intangible asset becomes its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment charge is prohibited 
the common valuation technique for trademark and trade names is the relief from royalty method 
the theory is that these assets relieve the owner from having to pay a hypothetical royalty attributable to an exclusive license for selling products under the trademark or trade name 
the value of the hypothetical exclusive license is based upon the present value of a stream of hypothetical royalty payments  using assumptions for revenue growth the same as for goodwill testing  discount rates slightly more risk premium than for goodwill testing  royalty rates based on market data  and tax amortization benefits based upon statutory guidance 
no impairment charges related to indefinite lived intangible assets were recorded in impairment charges totaling  were recorded in as follows by reporting unit dage  picodostec  yestech  and tah industries  the charge for the tah trade name was due to our branding program  under which tah product lines are being integrated into and marketed as nordson efd over the next several years 
accordingly  the tah trade name was converted to a finite lived asset 
other long lived assets our test for recoverability of long lived depreciable and amortizable assets used undiscounted cash flows 
long lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows 
the total carrying value of long lived assets for each reporting unit has been compared to the forecasted cash flows of each reporting unit s long lived assets being tested 
cash flows have been defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  less annual maintenance capital spending 
estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset asset group are based on the remaining useful life of the asset 
we believe that the relative value of long lived assets within each reporting unit is a reasonable proxy for the relative importance of the assets in the production of cash flow 
to get to a reasonable forecast period  the aggregate net book value of long lived assets was divided by the current depreciation and amortization value to arrive at a blended remaining useful life 
our calculations for showed the undiscounted aggregate value of cash flows over the remaining useful life for each reporting unit was greater than the respective carrying value of the lived assets within each reporting unit  so no impairment charges were recognized 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost was determined using the last in  first out lifo method for percent of consolidated inventories at october   and percent at october   with the first in  first out fifo method used for the remaining inventory 
on an ongoing basis  inventory is tested for technical obsolescence  as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions 
we have historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered 
reserves are also maintained for inventory used for demonstration purposes 
the inventory reserve balance was   and  at october   and  respectively 
pension plans and postretirement medical plans the measurement of liabilities related to our pension plans and postretirement medical plans is based on management s assumptions related to future factors  including interest rates  return on pension plan assets  compensation increases  mortality and turnover assumptions  and health care cost trend rates 

table of contents the weighted average discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was percent at october  and percent at october  the discount rate for these plans  which comprised percent of the worldwide pension obligations at october   was based on quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine the present value of our various international pension plan obligations was percent at october   compared to percent at october  the discount rates used for the international plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled 
in determining the expected return on plan assets  we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long term rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans 
we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions 
the expected rate of return long term investment rate on domestic pension assets was percent at october  and percent at october  the average expected rate of return on international pension assets was percent at october  and percent at october  the assumed rate of compensation increases for domestic employees was percent for both and the assumed rate of compensation increases for international employees was percent in  compared to percent in annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year 
differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years 
economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate  expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below 
bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts 
united states international point point point point increase decrease increase decrease discount rate effect on total service and interest cost components in effect on pension obligation as of october  expected return on assets effect on total service and interest cost components in effect on pension obligation as of october  compensation increase effect on total service and interest cost components in effect on pension obligation as of october  with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan  the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation decreased from percent at october  to percent at october  the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be percent in  decreasing gradually to percent in for the international postretirement plan  the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was percent at october  and percent at october  the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be percent in  decreasing gradually to percent in 
table of contents the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
for example  a one percentage point change in the discount rate and assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects united states international point point point point increase decrease increase decrease discount rate effect on total service and interest cost components in effect on postretirement obligation as of october  health care trend rate effect on total service and interest cost components in effect on postretirement obligation as of october  employees hired after january   are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan 
pension and postretirement expenses in are expected to be approximately  lower than  primarily due to a settlement loss in resulting from a lump sum retirement payment 
financial instruments assets  liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which are derivative financial instruments  to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables  payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies 
the maturities of these contracts are usually less than days 
forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and therefore are marked to market each accounting period  and the resulting gains or losses are included in other net within other income expense in the consolidated statement of income 
warranties we provide customers with a product warranty that requires us to repair or replace defective products within a specified period of time generally one year from the date of delivery or first use 
an accrual is recorded for expected warranty costs for products shipped through the end of each accounting period 
in determining the amount of the accrual  we rely primarily on historical warranty claims 
amounts charged to the warranty reserve were   and  in  and  respectively 
the reserve balance was   and  at october   and  respectively 
long term incentive compensation plan ltip under the long term incentive compensation plan  executive officers and selected other employees receive stock payouts based solely on corporate performance measures over three year performance periods 
payouts vary based on the degree to which corporate performance equals or exceeds predetermined threshold  target and maximum performance levels at the end of a performance period 
no payout will occur unless certain threshold performance objectives are equaled or exceeded 
the amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections for each three year period and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered 
the calculation is also based upon the grant date fair value determined using a black scholes model 
payouts are recorded as capital in excess of stated value in shareholders equity 
the amount recorded at october  for the plans originating in  and was  compensation expense attributable to all ltip performance periods for executive officers and selected other employees for and was  and  respectively 
there was  credited to expense attributable to all ltip performance periods for executive officers and selected other employees for due to economic effects

income taxes income tax expense in was  or percent of pre tax income 
income tax expense in was  most of the goodwill and long lived asset impairment charges recorded in were not deductible for income tax purposes 
the effective tax rate was positively impacted by a tax benefit of  from the write off of the tax basis in our uv graphics arts and lamps product lines 
the current year tax rate was also positively impacted by consolidation of certain operations and legal entities  resulting in a  tax benefit  and by the utilization of foreign operating tax loss carryforwards 

table of contents the effective rate was impacted by an additional tax charge of  resulting from the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the subsequent enactment of the health care and education reconciliation act of this charge was due to a reduction in the value of a deferred tax asset as a result of a change to the tax treatment associated with medicare part d subsidies 
net income loss net income was  or per diluted share  in this compares to a net loss of  or per diluted share  in recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued a standard regarding fair value measurements 
this standard provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable 
it also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measures on earnings 
in february  the fasb issued an update that permitted a one year deferral of the original standard for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we adopted the non deferred portion of the standard as of november  and the deferred portion of the standard as of november  the adoptions did not impact our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued a standard that provides greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations 
the standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires the acquirer to disclose the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
we adopted this standard as of november   and the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
the future impact will depend on the nature and significance of future acquisitions 
in december  the fasb issued a pronouncement that establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
we adopted this pronouncement as of november  the impact of adoption will depend on future transactions 
to date  there was no impact of the adoption on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued a standard that enhances the required disclosures about plan assets in an employer s defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan  including investment allocations decisions  inputs and valuations techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and significant concentrations of risks within plan assets 
we adopted this standard as of october   and the required disclosures are contained in note in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements that addresses the unit of accounting for arrangements involving multiple deliverables 
the guidance also addresses how arrangement consideration should be allocated to separate units of accounting  when applicable  and expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable arrangements

table of contents the following is a summary of significant changes by balance sheet caption from october  to october  receivables  inventories and accounts payable increased due primarily to higher level of business activity in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of prepaid expenses decreased primarily due to the sale of the uv curing graphic arts and lamps product lines in goodwill increased primarily due to the purchase of glt in long term deferred income taxes changed from a net asset position of  at the end of to a net liability position of  at the end of the primary reasons for the change were the acceleration of a tax deduction related to a pension contribution made in and a change to the tax treatment associated with medicare part d subsidies 
the increase in other long term assets is largely due to a long term receivable associated with the sale of uv curing graphic arts and lamps product lines  and increases in pension assets and in the market value of assets held in a rabbi trust that serves as an investment to shadow our deferred compensation plan liability 
the increase in income taxes payable is largely due to a higher profitability level in the increase in accrued liabilities is primarily due to accruals for salaries and incentive compensation offset by payments of supplemental pension and deferred compensation liabilities 
current maturities of long term debt increased due to scheduled repayments of senior notes 
the decrease in long term pension and retirement obligations is the result of the pension plan contributions referred to above partially offset by the effects of lower discount rates 
on december   the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to  shares 
uses for repurchased shares include the funding of benefit programs including stock options  nonvested stock and k matching

the following table summarizes contractual obligations as of october  payments due by period less than after obligations total year years years years long term debt interest payments on long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases notes payable contributions related to pension and postretirement benefits purchase obligations total obligations we have a  unsecured  multicurrency credit facility with a group of banks that expires in and may be increased to  under certain conditions 
at october    was outstanding under this facility  compared to  outstanding at october  there are two primary financial covenants that must be met under this facility 
the first covenant limits the amount of total indebtedness that can be incurred to times consolidated trailing ebitda both indebtedness and ebitda as defined in the credit agreement 
the second covenant requires consolidated trailing ebitda to be at least three times consolidated trailing interest expense both as defined in the credit agreement 
at october   we were in compliance with all debt covenants  and the amount we could borrow under the credit facility would not have been limited by any debt covenants 

table of contents in  we entered into a note purchase and private shelf agreement the agreement with prudential investment management  inc the agreement consists of a  senior note and a  private shelf facility 
the senior note bears interest at a rate of percent and matures on february  the agreement also contains customary events of default and covenants related to limitations on indebtedness and the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants at october  under the private shelf facility  we may also borrow during the next three years up to  at interest rates in effect at the time of borrowing 
borrowings can be for up to years with an average life not to exceed years 
at october   the amount we could borrow under the private shelf facility would not have been limited by any debt covenants 
see note for additional information 
see note for additional information 
we have various lines of credit with foreign banks totaling  of which  was unused at october  see note for additional information 
pension and postretirement plan funding amounts after will be determined based on the future funded status of the plans and therefore cannot be estimated at this time 
see note for additional information 
purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for materials used in our manufacturing processes that are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that the combination of present capital resources  internally generated funds and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company 
outlook our operating performance in rebounded from  which was affected by disruptions in global financial markets and the general economic environment 
going forward  we are well positioned to manage our liquidity 
our liquidity needs arise from working capital requirements  capital expenditures and principal and interest payments on indebtedness 
primary sources of capital to meet these needs are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements 
in  cash from operations was percent of revenue  including voluntary contributions to our us pension plans and one time postretirement payments representing percent of revenue  compared to percent in comparatively  during the and recession years  cash from operations were percent and percent  respectively  and then ranged from percent to percent in subsequent years until funds provided by borrowings occur under a  five year committed revolving line of credit with a group of domestic and international banks that expires in as of october  we were in compliance with the financial covenant of this credit facility and have  available borrowing capacity

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
consequently  we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled 
we regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions 
these contracts  primarily associated with the euro  yen and british pound  typically have maturities of days or less  and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for united states dollars at rates stated in the contracts 
gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains  respectively  on the underlying transactions 
other transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a long term investment nature
