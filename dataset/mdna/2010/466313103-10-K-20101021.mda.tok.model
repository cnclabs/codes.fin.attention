we provide comprehensive electronics design  production  product management and aftermarket services to companies in the aerospace  automotive  computing  consumer  defense  industrial  instrumentation  medical  networking  peripherals  solar  storage and telecommunications industries 
the industry in which we operate is composed of companies that provide a range of manufacturing and design services to companies that utilize electronics components 
the industry experienced rapid change and growth through the s as an increasing number of companies chose to outsource an increasing portion  and  in some cases  all of their manufacturing requirements 
in mid  the industry s revenue declined as a result of significant cut backs in customer production requirements  which was consistent with the overall downturn in the technology sector at the time 
in response to this downturn in the technology sector  we implemented restructuring programs to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers 
industry revenues generally began to stabilize in and companies turned to outsourcing versus internal manufacturing 
in addition  the number of industries serviced  as well as the market penetration in certain industries  by electronic manufacturing service providers has increased over the past several years 
in mid  the industry s revenue declined when a deteriorating macro economic environment resulted in illiquidity in the overall credit markets and a significant economic downturn in the north american  european and asian markets 
in response to this downturn  we implemented additional restructuring programs to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers 
though significant uncertainty remains regarding the extent and timing of the economic recovery  we continue to see signs of stabilization as the overall credit markets have significantly improved and it appears that the global economic stimulus programs put in place are having a positive impact  particularly in china 
we will continue to monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers that we serve as well as our end markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can respond appropriately as circumstances continue to change 
also  as a result of recent economic conditions  some of our customers have moved a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity 
this movement  and possible future movements  may negatively impact our results of operations 
at august  our reportable operating segments consisted of three segments consumer  ems and ams 
on september   we re organized our business into the following three groups dms  e i and hvs 
our dms group is composed of dedicated resources to manage higher complexity global products in regulated industries and bring materials and process technologies including design and aftermarket services to our global 
table of contents customers 
our e i and hvs groups offer integrated global supply chain solutions designed to provide cost effective solutions for our customers 
our e i group is focused on our customers primarily in the computing and storage  networking and telecommunication sectors 
our hvs group is focused on the particular needs of the consumer products industry  including mobility  set top boxes and peripheral products such as printers and point of sale terminals 
we derive revenue principally from the product sales of electronic equipment built to customer specifications 
we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from aftermarket services  design services and excess inventory sales 
revenue from product sales and excess inventory sales is generally recognized  net of estimated product return costs  when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and recoverability is reasonably assured 
aftermarket service related revenue is recognized upon completion of the services 
design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer 
we assume no significant obligations after product shipment 
our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture  the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead  and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services  we are responsible for procuring components and other materials 
this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing  receiving  inspection and stocking of materials 
although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap  we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers 
net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product 
we refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue  and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue 
our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product 
we typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue 
as we gain experience in manufacturing a product  we usually achieve increased efficiencies  which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product 
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities  indirect labor costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization 
during periods of low production volume  we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins 
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design  production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers 
to support this effort  our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers 
most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue 
in addition  our engineers engage in r d of new technologies that apply generally to our operations 
the expenses of these r d activities are reflected in the research and development line item in our consolidated statement of operations 
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities 
the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in us dollars  while our labor and utility costs in operations outside the us are denominated in local currencies 
we economically hedge these local currency costs  based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge  through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts 
changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
see risk factors we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations 
we currently depend  and expect to continue to depend  upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their growth  viability and financial stability 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our large customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us 
there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services 
table of contents ordered from us 
any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
see risk factors because we depend on a limited number of customers  a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue  risk factors most of our customers do not commit to long term production schedules  which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and capital expenditures  and to maximize the efficiency of our manufacturing capacity  risk factors our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities  delay production or change their sourcing strategy and note concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements 
summary of results net revenues for fiscal year increased approximately to billion compared to billion for fiscal year largely due to increases in all of our sectors  except for our telecommunications and other sectors which includes our automotive business and certain of our other businesses 
these increases are primarily due to increased revenue from existing customers and programs as our customers confidence in their markets strengthen and their end customers demand levels increase  as well as new customer wins and new program wins with existing customers 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan to better align our manufacturing capacity in certain geographies and to reduce our worldwide workforce by approximately  employees in order to reduce operating expenses the restructuring plan 
these restructuring activities were intended to address market conditions and properly size our manufacturing facilities to increase the efficiencies of our operations 
based on the analysis completed to date  we currently expect to recognize approximately million in pre tax restructuring and impairment costs and reduce our worldwide headcount by a total of approximately  employees which costs and headcount reduction were recognized primarily over the course of fiscal years and in addition  we recorded a valuation allowance of million on certain net deferred tax assets related to the restructuring plan 
the restructuring charges include pre tax employee severance and termination benefit costs  contract termination costs and other related restructuring costs 
the impairment charges include pre tax fixed asset impairment costs  as well as valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets 
this information will be subject to the finalization of timetables for the transition of functions  consultation with employees and their representatives as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted  and the amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors 
based on the ongoing assessment of market conditions  it is possible that we may perform additional restructuring activities in the future 
for further discussion of this restructuring program and the restructuring and impairment costs recognized  refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and impairment charges and note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents key performance indicators management regularly reviews financial and non financial performance indicators to assess the company s operating results

during the three months ended august   days in trade accounts receivable remained consistent at days as compared to the prior sequential quarter 
during the three months ended may   days in trade accounts receivable decreased two days to days as compared to the prior sequential quarter as a result of the sale of trade accounts receivable under the uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs  timing of sales and focused efforts on cash collection during the quarter 
during the three months ended february   days in trade accounts receivable decreased six days to days from the prior sequential quarter as a result of the timing of sales and focused efforts on cash collection during the quarter  as well as related seasonality factors 
during the three months ended november  days in trade accounts receivable remained consistent at days as compared to the prior sequential quarter 
during the three months ended august   days in inventory increased three days to days and inventory turns remained consistent at seven turns as compared to the prior sequential quarter primarily due to increased inventory levels as a result of the following positioning ourselves to meet the upcoming quarterly demand levels and carrying higher levels of certain raw materials in order to meet customer demand due to the constrained materials environment which has caused material component lead times to be extended 
for further discussion of material shortages see risk factors we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes 
a shortage of these components or an increase in their price could interrupt our operations and reduce our profits  increase our inventory carrying costs  increase our risk of exposure to inventory obsolescence and cause us to purchase components of a lesser quality 
during the three months ended may   days in inventory decreased one day to days and inventory turns remained constant at seven turns as compared to the prior sequential quarter primarily due to increased sales during the period 
during the three months ended february   days in inventory increased six days to days and inventory turns decreased one turn to seven turns as compared to the prior sequential quarter as a result of a ramp up of inventory levels to support new business wins  as well as raw material shortages due to an unforeseen constrained materials environment which caused material component lead times to be extended 
during the three months ended november   days in inventory increased three days to days and inventory turns decreased one turn to eight turns as compared to the 
table of contents prior sequential quarter primarily due to increased inventory levels to support higher demand for consumer products during the holiday selling season

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from the product sales of electronic equipment built to customer specifications 
we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from aftermarket services  design services and excess inventory sales 
revenue from product sales and excess inventory sales is generally recognized  net of estimated product return costs  when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and recoverability is reasonably assured 
aftermarket service related revenue is recognized upon completion of the services 
design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer 
we assume no significant obligations after product shipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers 
this allowance is based on management s assessment of specific customer balances  considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer 
if there is an adverse change in the financial condition and circumstances of our customers  or if actual defaults are higher than provided for  an addition to the allowance may be necessary 
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage  customer inventory related contractual obligations and other lower of cost or market considerations 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional valuation adjustments may be necessary 

table of contents long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected cash flows that the asset s or asset group s are expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its respective fair value  which is generally determined as either the present value of estimated future cash flows or the appraised value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy or adverse economic conditions 
for further discussion of our current restructuring program  refer to note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and impairment charges 
we have recorded intangible assets  including goodwill  in connection with business acquisitions 
estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows 
the allocation of amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts allocable to goodwill 
we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level  which we have determined to be consistent with our operating segments  by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair market value of the reporting unit 
we consistently determine the fair market value of our reporting units based on an average weighting of both projected discounted future results and the use of comparative market multiples 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of loss  if any 
we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that the fair value of our reporting units are substantially in excess of the carrying values and that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test 
restructuring and impairment charges we have recognized restructuring and impairment charges related to reductions in workforce  re sizing and closure of certain facilities and the transition of production from certain facilities into other new and existing facilities 
these charges were recorded pursuant to formal plans developed and approved by management and our board of directors 
the recognition of restructuring and impairment charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with these plans 
the estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring additional restructuring and impairment charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with the restructuring programs 
for further discussion of our restructuring programs  refer to note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and impairment charges 
retirement benefits we have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities in certain foreign locations that are developed from actuarial valuations 
actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates of discount rates  compensation rate increases and return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data 
the discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
this rate represents the market rate for 
table of contents high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
when considering the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we take into account current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets 
other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
for further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits  refer to note postretirement and other employee benefits to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria 
we assess whether an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return meets the threshold for recognition and measurement in the consolidated financial statements 
our judgments regarding future taxable income as well as tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances and or tax reserves established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 
the internal revenue service irs completed its field examination of our tax returns for the fiscal years through and issued a revenue agent s report rar on april  proposing adjustments primarily related to certain costs that we treated as corporate expenses and that the irs proposes be charged out to our foreign affiliates and certain purported intangible values the irs felt were transferred to certain of our foreign subsidiaries free of charge 
if the irs ultimately prevails in its positions  our additional income tax payment due for the fiscal years through would be approximately million before utilization of any tax attributes arising in periods subsequent to fiscal year in addition  the irs will likely make similar claims in future audits with respect to these types of transactions at this time  determination of the additional income tax due for these later years is not practicable 
also  the irs has proposed interest and penalties with respect to fiscal years through and we anticipate the irs may seek to impose interest and penalties in subsequent years with respect to the same types of issues 
we disagree with the proposed adjustments and intend to vigorously contest this matter through applicable irs and judicial procedures  as appropriate 
as the final resolution of the proposed adjustments remains uncertain  we continue to provide for the uncertain tax position based on the more likely than not standards 
accordingly  we did not record any significant additional tax liabilities related to this rar on the consolidated balance sheets for fiscal year while the resolution of the issues may result in tax liabilities  interest and penalties  which are significantly higher than the amounts provided for this matter  we currently believe that the resolution will not have a material effect on our financial position or liquidity 
despite this belief  an unfavorable resolution  particularly if the irs successfully asserts similar claims for later years  could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition particularly in the quarter in which any adjustment is recorded or any tax is due or paid 
for further discussion related to our income taxes  refer to note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements and risk factors we are subject to the risk of increased taxes 
stock based compensation we began recognizing stock based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations on september  the fair value of options granted prior to september  were valued using the black scholes model while the stock appreciation rights granted after this date were valued using a lattice model 
option pricing models require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the option or stock appreciation right  risk free rate  expected dividend yield and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock awards that are expected to vest as a result of satisfaction of time based vesting schedules or the achievement of certain performance conditions 
if actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  stock based compensation expense could

our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year specific increases include a increase in the sale of instrumentation and medical products  a increase in the sale of networking products  an increase in the sale of mobility products  a increase in the sale of aftermarket services  a increase in the sale of digital home office products  and a increase in the sale of computing and storage products 
these increases are primarily due to increased revenue from existing customers and programs as our customers confidence in their markets strengthen and their end customers demand levels increase  as well as new customer wins and new program wins with existing customers 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the sale of telecommunications products and a decrease in the sale of other products primarily due to our decision to largely exit the automotive sector in conjunction with the sale of our subsidiary jabil circuit automotive  sas 
generally  we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition 
accordingly  we do not differentiate or report separately revenue 
table of contents increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business 
in addition  the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  revenue by industry sector expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
the distribution of revenue across our industry sectors has fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of numerous factors  including but not limited to the following fluctuations in customer demand as a result of the recent recessionary conditions and current  relatively weak recovery despite our relatively recent increase in revenue due to increases from existing customer programs  new customer wins and new program wins with existing customers  efforts to de emphasize the economic performance of certain sectors  most specifically  our former automotive sector  seasonality in our business  and business growth from new and existing customers  including production of new products in the mobility sector 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we began to report the display and peripheral sectors as a combined sector called digital home office 
in addition  the automotive sector is no longer reported separately and has been combined in the other sector 
fiscal year ended august  ems computing and storage instrumentation and medical networking telecommunications other total ems consumer digital home office mobility total consumer ams total foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of net revenue for fiscal year we currently expect our foreign source revenue to remain relatively consistent as compared to current levels over the course of the next months 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to billion of net revenue for fiscal year from million of net revenue for fiscal year the increase in gross profit on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net revenue from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to increased revenue from existing customers and programs as our customers confidence in their markets strengthen and their end customers demand levels increase as well as new customer wins and new program wins with existing customers which allow us to better utilize capacity and absorb fixed costs 
further  we have realized certain cost savings associated with initiatives that we commenced in fiscal year to reduce our cost structure in order to better align with lower demand levels and increased capacity utilization which allows us to better leverage our cost structure 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenue for fiscal year from million of net revenue for fiscal year the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net revenue from the prior fiscal year was largely due to increases in stock based compensation expense of million primarily due to a change in the estimated vesting of performance based restricted stock awards and incremental expense recognized related to the modification of certain existing equity awards to include retirement eligibility provisions  million related to additional salary and bonus expense due to increased headcount and 
table of contents results of operations in the current fiscal year and million related to professional fees associated with multiple internal strategic and cost saving initiatives 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses for fiscal year increased to million of net revenue from million of net revenue for fiscal year the increase is attributed primarily due to our increased focus on vertical integration capabilities in our mobility sector and increased capabilities and proficiencies in digital home office and printer markets 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease is primarily attributable to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized since august  for additional information regarding purchased intangibles  see acquisitions and expansion below  note f description of business and summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets and note goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and impairment charges 
a 
restructuring plan in conjunction with the restructuring plan  we currently expect to recognize approximately million in total restructuring and impairment costs  excluding valuation allowances of million on certain deferred tax assets  which has been recognized primarily over the course of fiscal years and of this expected total  we charged million and million of restructuring and impairment costs during the months ended august  and august   respectively  to our consolidated statement of operations 
the charges related to the restructuring plan during fiscal year include approximately million related to employee severance and termination benefit costs  million related to lease commitments and million related to fixed asset impairments 
the million of restructuring and impairment charges related to the restructuring plan incurred through august  include cash costs totaling million  of which million was paid in fiscal year the cash costs of approximately million consist of employee severance and termination benefit costs of approximately million  lease commitment costs of approximately million and other restructuring costs of approximately million 
non cash costs of approximately million primarily represent fixed asset impairment charges related to our restructuring activities 
at august   accrued liabilities of approximately million related to the restructuring plan are expected to be paid over the next months 
upon its completion  the restructuring plan is expected to yield annualized cost savings of approximately million 
the majority of these annual cost savings are expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue  with a small portion being reflected as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expense 
these expected annualized cost savings reflect a reduction in employee expense of approximately million  a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately million  a reduction in lease commitment costs of approximately million  a reduction of other manufacturing costs of approximately million and a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million 
of the million of expected annualized cost savings  we have realized a cumulative cost savings of approximately million by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year as part of the restructuring plan  we have determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets would not be realized as a result of the contemplated restructuring activities 
therefore  we recorded a valuation allowance of million on net deferred tax assets related to the restructuring plan 
the valuation allowance is excluded from the restructuring and impairment charge of million incurred through august  as it was recorded through income tax expense on our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents b 
restructuring plan upon the approval by our board of directors  we initiated a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the restructuring plan 
we have substantially completed restructuring activities under this plan with certain contract termination costs to be incurred through fiscal year we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million during fiscal year and a reversal of restructuring and impairment costs of million in fiscal year the restructuring and impairment costs for fiscal year primarily include additional lease commitment charges 
at august   liabilities of approximately million related to the restructuring plan are expected to be paid out over the next months 
the remaining liability of million relates primarily to the charge for certain lease commitments and employee severance and termination benefits payments 
as of august   as a result of the restructuring activities related to the restructuring plan  we expect to avoid annual costs of approximately million that would otherwise have been incurred if the restructuring activities had not been completed 
the expected avoided annual costs consist of a reduction in employee related expenses of approximately million  a reduction in depreciation expense associated with impaired fixed assets of approximately million  and a reduction in rent expense associated with leased buildings that have been vacated of approximately million 
the majority of these annual cost savings will be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue  with a small portion being reflected as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expense 
these annual costs savings are expected to be partially offset by decreased revenues associated with certain products that are approaching the end of life stage  decreased revenues as a result of shifting production to operations located in lower cost regions where competitive environmental pressures require that we pass those cost savings onto our customers  and incremental employee related costs expected to be incurred by those operations to which the production will be shifted 
after considering these cost savings offsets  we began to realize the full net annualized cost savings of approximately million during the third quarter of fiscal year for further discussion of the restructuring programs  see note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment charges 
we recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of billion for the full fiscal year ended august  of which the entire billion charge was incurred in the first two quarters to reduce the carrying amount of our goodwill to its estimated fair value based upon the results of two interim impairment tests conducted during the first and second quarters of fiscal year we performed these impairment tests based upon a combination of factors  including a significant and sustained decline in our market capitalization below our carrying value  the deteriorating macro economic environment  which resulted in a significant decline in customer demand  and illiquidity in the overall credit markets 
after recognition of these charges  no goodwill remained with the consumer and ems reporting units  respectively  and approximately million remained with the ams reporting unit

loss on disposal of subsidiaries 
on october   we sold the operations of jabil circuit automotive  sas  an automotive electronic manufacturing subsidiary located in western europe to an unrelated third party 
in connection with this sale  we recorded a loss on disposition of approximately million  which includes approximately million in transaction costs incurred in connection with the sale 
on july   we sold our operations in italy as well as our remaining operations in france to an unrelated third party 
divested operations  inclusive of four sites and approximately  employees  had net revenues and an operating loss of million and million  respectively from the beginning of the fiscal year through the date of disposition 
in connection with this transaction  we provided an aggregate million working capital loan to the disposed operations and agreed to provide for the aggregate potential reimbursement of up to million in restructuring costs dependent upon the occurrence of certain future events 
the working capital loan bears interest on a quarterly basis at libor plus basis points and is repayable over approximately months dependent upon 
table of contents the achievement of certain specified quarterly financial results of the operations being disposed  which if not met would result in the forgiveness of all or a portion of the loan 
accordingly  dependent on the occurrence of such future events  we may incur up to an additional million of charges 
as a result of this sale  we recorded a loss on disposition of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which included transaction related costs of million and a charge of million in order to record the working capital loan at its respective fair market value at august  based upon a discounted cash flow analysis 
these costs are recorded to loss on disposal of subsidiaries on our consolidated statements of operations  which is a component of operating income 
other expense 
we recorded other expense totaling million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
the decrease in other expense for fiscal year was primarily due to the recognition of a million loss on the extinguishment of million of our senior notes and a million loss on the impairment of a note receivable in fiscal year as well as a decrease in the loss on the sale of accounts receivable under our asset backed securitization program of million in fiscal year which was primarily due to a decrease in borrowing costs 
for further discussion of our accounts receivable securitization program  see note trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower overall interest rates during fiscal year interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower overall interest rates during fiscal year income tax expense 
income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  as compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year the effective tax rate differs from the previous period due to the impairment of non deductible goodwill and the corresponding valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets that were no longer more likely than not to be realized in fiscal year the tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
most of our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the us  primarily due to tax incentives granted to our sites in brazil  china  hungary  malaysia  poland  singapore and vietnam 
the material tax incentives expire at various dates through such tax incentives are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply

fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue decreased to billion for fiscal year  down from billion in fiscal year specific decreases include a decrease in the sale of digital home office products  a decrease in the sale of networking products  an decrease in the sale of computing and storage products  a decrease in the sale of telecommunication products  a decrease in the sale of instrumentation and medical products  and a decrease in the sale of other products 
these decreases were largely driven by reduced production levels as a result of softened customer demand due to the weakened macro economic environment 
specific increases include an increase in aftermarket services and a increase in the sale of mobility products predominately related to the production of new products with an existing customer within the sector 
foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of net revenue for fiscal year for further discussion of our net revenues  refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million of net revenue for fiscal year from million of net revenue for fiscal year the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to our revenues decreasing at a higher rate than certain of our fixed costs 
table of contents as we continued to seek to reduce our cost structure in order to align with lower demand levels and our excess capacity given macro economic conditions that existed 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenue for fiscal year from million of net revenue for fiscal year on an absolute dollar basis  selling general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant 
certain of our selling  general and administrative costs are generally necessary to support our business and the need for such support does not immediately change as a result of our revenues increasing or decreasing 
on a percentage basis  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  therefore  was primarily due to our revenues decreasing at a higher rate than certain of our selling  general and administrative costs as compared to the months ended august  research and development 
research and development expenses for fiscal year decreased to million of net revenue from million of net revenue for fiscal year the decrease is attributed primarily to the de emphasis of original design manufacture in certain consumer sectors 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributable to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized since august  for additional information regarding purchased intangibles  see acquisitions and expansion below  note f description of business and summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets and note goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and impairment charges 
a 
restructuring plan we charged million in restructuring and impairment charges during fiscal year related to the restructuring plan 
these charges related to the restructuring plan include million related to employee severance and termination benefit costs  million related to lease commitments  million related to fixed asset impairments and million related to other restructuring costs 
these million restructuring and impairment charges related to the restructuring plan incurred through august  include cash costs totaling million  of which million was paid in fiscal year the cash costs of million consist of employee severance and termination benefit costs of approximately million  million related to lease commitments  and approximately million related to other restructuring costs 
non cash costs of approximately million primarily represent fixed asset impairment charges related to our restructuring activities 
as part of the restructuring plan  we have determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets would not be realized as a result of the contemplated restructuring activities 
therefore  we recorded a valuation allowance of million on deferred tax assets as a result of the restructuring plan as of august  the valuation allowances are excluded from the restructuring and impairment charge of million for fiscal year as they were recorded through the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statement of operations 
for further discussion of this restructuring program  refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  restructuring and impairment charges 
b 
restructuring plan we recorded a reversal of restructuring and impairment costs of million during fiscal year and a charge of restructuring and impairment costs of million in fiscal year related to the restructuring plan 
the reversal of restructuring and impairment costs for fiscal year include  million related to less employee severance and termination benefit costs than originally anticipated  offset by additional lease commitment charges of million

other expense 
we recorded other expense totaling million and million for the fiscal years ending august  and  respectively 
the increase in other expense was primarily due to recognizing a loss of million on the extinguishment of million of our senior notes and recording a loss on the impairment of a note receivable for million 
this increase was primarily offset by a decrease in the loss on the sale of accounts receivable under our asset backed securitization program of million which was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of receivables sold under the program during the fiscal year ended august   as well as a decrease in the interest rates during the period 
the net cash proceeds available at any one time under the asset backed securitization program was decreased from million to million during fiscal year for further discussion of our accounts receivable securitization program  see note trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower overall interest rates during the year 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily a result of lower variable interest rates and lower utilization of the foreign asset backed securitization program during the months ended august  as compared to the same period in fiscal year income tax expense 
income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  as compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year the effective tax rate differs from the previous period due to the impairment of non deductible goodwill and the corresponding valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets that are no longer more likely than not to be realized 
the tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
most of our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the us  primarily due to tax incentives granted to our sites in brazil  china  hungary  india  malaysia and poland that expire at various dates through such tax incentives are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply

non us gaap core financial measures the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non us gaap financial measures as identified in the reconciliation below 
the non us gaap financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non us gaap financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time 
non us gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us gaap 
also  our core financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items which are excluded from our core financial measures 
management believes that the non us gaap core financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a 
table of contents comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles  restructuring and impairment charges  goodwill impairment charges  certain distressed customer charges  loss on disposal of subsidiary  certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges and stock based compensation expense and related charges 
among other uses  management uses non us gaap core financial measures as a factor in determining employee performance when determining incentive compensation 
we are reporting core operating income and core earnings to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings from what we believe are our core manufacturing operations 
most of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets  resulting in all or a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset 
in the case of restructuring charges  we may be making associated cash payments in the future 
in addition  although  for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings  we excluded stock based compensation expense which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future because it is a non cash expense  the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock  which may result in the dilution of our stockholders ownership interest 
we encourage you to evaluate these items and the limitations for purposes of analysis in excluding them 
included in the table below is a reconciliation of the non us gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measures as provided in our consolidated financial statements in thousands fiscal year ended august  operating income loss us gaap amortization of intangibles stock based compensation and related charges restructuring and impairment charges goodwill impairment charges loss on disposal of subsidiaries distressed customer charges core operating income non us gaap net income loss attributable to jabil circuit  inc us gaap amortization of intangibles  net of tax stock based compensation and related charges  net of tax restructuring and impairment charges  net of tax goodwill impairment charges  net of tax loss on disposal of subsidiaries  net of tax distressed customer charges  net of tax deferred tax valuation allowance charges other expense  net of tax core earnings non us gaap

liquidity and capital resources at august   we had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling million  total notes payable  long term debt and capital lease obligations of billion  million in available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities and up to million in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable securitization and uncommitted sale programs 

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the fiscal year ended august selected consolidated cash flow information in thousands fiscal year ended august  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended august  was approximately million 
this resulted primarily from net income of million  a billion increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  million in non cash depreciation and amortization expense  million in non cash stock based compensation expense  million in loss on disposal of subsidiaries  a million increase in income tax payable and million in restructuring and impairment charges  which were partially offset by a million increase in inventories  a million increase in trade accounts receivable and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily driven by the timing of purchases and cash payments 
the increase in accounts receivable was predominately attributable to increased sales during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in inventories was primarily due to the ramp up of inventory levels to support new business wins  as well as raw material shortages due to a constrained materials environment which has caused material component lead times to be extended 
for further discussion of material shortages see risk factors we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes 
a shortage of these components or an increase in their price could interrupt our operations and reduce our profits  increase our inventory carrying costs  increase our risk of exposure to inventory obsolescence and cause us to purchase components of a lesser quality 
net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended august  was million 
this consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million for investments in capacity to support the ongoing production of new programs within the mobility sector and information technology infrastructure  proceeds from the disposal of subsidiaries net of cash of million and notes receivable from sale of million  which were partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended august  was million 
this resulted from our receipt of approximately billion of proceeds from borrowings under existing debt agreements  which primarily included an aggregate of billion of borrowings under the revolving portion of the credit facility and million in borrowings under our short term indian working capital facilities 
this was offset by repayments in an aggregate amount of approximately billion during fiscal year  which primarily included an aggregate of billion of repayments under the revolving portion of the credit facility and million of repayments under our short term indian working capital facilities 
in addition  we paid million of dividends to stockholders during fiscal year we may need to finance day to day working capital needs  as well as future growth and any corresponding working capital needs  with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facilities described below  as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity 
currently  we have a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future  from time to time  to augment our liquidity and capital resources 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we entered into an asset backed securitization program with a bank  which originally provided for net cash proceeds at any one time of an amount up to million on the sale of eligible trade accounts receivable of certain domestic operations 
subsequent to fiscal year  several amendments have adjusted the net cash proceeds available at any one time under the securitization program to an amount of million and extended the program until march  under this agreement  we continuously 
table of contents sell a designated pool of trade accounts receivable to a wholly owned subsidiary  which in turn sells an ownership interest in the receivables to a conduit  administered by an unaffiliated financial institution 
this wholly owned subsidiary is a separate bankruptcy remote entity and its assets would be available first to satisfy the claims of the conduit 
as the receivables sold are collected  we are able to sell additional receivables up to the maximum permitted amount under the program 
the securitization program requires compliance with several financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio and debt to ebitda ratio  as defined in the securitization agreements 
for each pool of eligible receivables sold to the conduit  we retain a percentage interest in the face value of the receivables  which is calculated based on the terms of the agreement 
net receivables sold under this program are excluded from trade accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we continue to service  administer and collect the receivables sold under this program 
we pay a fee on the unused portion of the facility of per annum based on the average daily unused aggregate capital during the period 
further  we pay a usage fee on the utilized portion of the facility equal to libor plus per annum inclusive of the unused fee on the average daily outstanding aggregate capital during the immediately preceding calendar month 
the securitization conduit and the investors in the conduit have no recourse to our assets for failure of debtors to pay when due 
at august   we had sold million of eligible trade accounts receivable  which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date 
in exchange  we received cash proceeds of million and retained an interest in the receivables of approximately million

see note new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party for the factoring of specific trade accounts receivable of a foreign subsidiary

proceeds on the transfer reflect the face value of the account less a discount 
the discount is recorded as a loss in our consolidated statements of operations in the period of the sale 
in september  the factoring agreement was extended through march   at which time it is expected to automatically renew for an additional six month period

on september   the sale program was amended to increase the facility limit to million of specific trade accounts receivable at any one time 
the program is accounted for as a sale 
net receivables sold under this program are excluded from trade accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
we paid an arrangement fee upon the initial sale and pay a transaction fee each month over the term of the agreement which are recorded to other expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the sale program expires on may  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into an additional uncommitted accounts receivable sale agreement with a bank which allows us and certain of our subsidiaries to elect to sell and the bank to elect to purchase at a discount  on an ongoing basis  up to a maximum of million of specific trade accounts receivable at any one time 
the program is accounted for as a sale 
net receivables sold under this program are excluded from

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of the senior notes  pursuant to a public cash tender offer  in which we also paid an early tender premium  accrued interest and associated fees and expenses 
the extinguishment of the validly tendered senior notes resulted in a charge of million which was recorded to other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the months ended august  the senior notes matured on july   and  at that time  the outstanding balance was fully paid 
b during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we issued a total of million  seven year  publicly registered senior unsecured notes the senior notes at of par  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million

the swaps were accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
the notional amount of the swaps was million 
concurrently with the pricing of the first million of the senior notes  we settled million of the swaps by our payment of million 
we also settled the remaining million of swaps during the second quarter of fiscal year by our payment of million

we also recorded million to interest expense as ineffectiveness in our consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended february   with the remainder recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes  on our consolidated balance sheets 
on may   we issued the remaining million of senior notes and recorded no additional interest expense as ineffectiveness in the consolidated statements of operations 
the effective portion of the swaps remaining on our consolidated balance sheets will be amortized to interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations over the life of the senior notes 
d during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into separate agreements with unrelated third parties for the factoring of specific trade accounts receivable of certain foreign subsidiaries 
the factoring of trade accounts receivable under these agreements did not meet the criteria for recognition as a sale 
under the terms of these agreements  we transferred ownership of eligible trade accounts receivable to the third party purchasers in exchange for cash  however  as these transactions did not qualify as a sale  the relating trade accounts receivable were included on our consolidated balance sheets until the cash was received by the purchasers from our customer for the trade accounts receivable 
this program was transferred in connection with our divestiture of our french and italian subsidiaries  and therefore  no liability is recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at august  we had an outstanding liability of approximately million on the consolidated balance sheets at august  related to these agreements 
e as of august   two of our foreign subsidiaries have entered into credit facilities to finance their future growth and any corresponding working capital needs 
the credit facilities are denominated in us dollars 
the credit facilities incur interest at fixed and variable rates ranging from to with million outstanding at august  f during the third quarter of fiscal year  we negotiated a five year  million indian rupee construction loan for an indian subsidiary with an indian branch of a global bank

table of contents during the second quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a three year loan agreement to borrow million from a software vendor in connection with various software licenses that we purchased from them 
the software licenses were capitalized and were being amortized over a three year period 
the loan agreement was non interest bearing and payments were due quarterly through october  when the loan agreement was terminated 
through the acquisition of a taiwanese subsidiary in fiscal year  we assumed certain liabilities  including short and long term debt obligations totaling approximately million at the date of acquisition 
at august   there are no amounts outstanding under these short term mortgage and credit facilities 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into the five year credit facility 
this agreement provides for a revolving credit portion in the initial amount of million  subject to potential increases up to billion  and provides for a term portion in the amount of million 
some or all of the lenders under the credit facility and their affiliates have various other relationships with us and our subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services  including cash management  loans  letter of credit and bank guarantee facilities  investment banking and trust services 
we  along with some of our subsidiaries  have entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates 
in addition  many  if not most  of the agents and lenders under the credit facility held positions as agent and or lender under our old revolving credit facility and the billion  day senior unsecured bridge loan facility  that was entered into on december   amended on december  and terminated on february  the revolving credit portion of the credit facility terminates on july   and the term loan portion of the credit facility requires payments of principal in annual installments of million each  with a final payment of the remaining principal due on july  interest and fees on credit facility advances are based on our unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by s p and moody s 
interest is charged at a rate equal to either to above the base rate or to above the eurocurrency rate  where the base rate represents the greater of citibank  na s prime rate or above the federal funds rate  and the eurocurrency rate represents the applicable london interbank offered rate  each as more fully defined in this credit agreement 
fees include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders  a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit  and a utilization fee to be added to the revolving credit interest rate and any letter of credit fee during any period when the aggregate amount of outstanding advances and letters of credit exceeds of the total revolving credit commitments of the lenders 
based on our current senior unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by s p and moody s  the current rate of interest including the applicable facility and utilization fee on a full draw under the revolving credit would be above the base rate or above the eurocurrency rate  and the current rate of interest on the term portion would be the base rate or above the eurocurrency rate 
we  along with our subsidiaries  are subject to the following financial covenants a maximum ratio of a debt as defined in the credit agreement to b consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement and a minimum ratio of a consolidated ebitda to b interest payable on  and amortization of debt discount in respect of  debt and loss on sales of trade accounts receivables pursuant to our securitization program

during the months ended august   we borrowed billion against the revolving credit portion of the credit facility 
these borrowings were repaid in full during fiscal year a draw in the amount of million has been made under the term portion of the credit facility and million remains outstanding at august  in addition to the loans described above  at august   we have additional loans outstanding to fund working capital needs 
these additional loans total approximately million and are denominated in euros 
the loans are due and payable within months and are classified as short term on our consolidated balance sheets 
g during the third quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a foreign asset backed securitization program with a bank conduit which originally provided for net borrowings available at any one time of up to million 

table of contents subsequent to fiscal year  certain amendments adjusted the net borrowings available at any one time under the securitization program to million 
in connection with the foreign securitization program certain of our foreign subsidiaries sell  on an ongoing basis  an undivided interest in designated pools of trade accounts receivable to a special purpose entity  which in turn borrows up to million from the bank conduit to purchase those receivables and in which it grants security interests as collateral for the borrowings 
the securitization program is accounted for as a borrowing 
the loan balance is calculated based on the terms of the securitization program agreements 
the foreign securitization program requires compliance with several covenants including a limitation on certain corporate actions such as mergers  consolidations and sale of substantially all assets 
we are assessed a monthly fee based on the maximum facility limit and  in addition  pay interest based on libor plus a spread 
the foreign securitization program expires on march  at august   we had million of debt outstanding under the program 
in addition  we incurred interest expense of million  million and million recorded in our consolidated statements of operations during the months ended august   and  respectively 
at august   and  we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants under the credit facility and our securitization programs 
our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through construction of greenfield operations or acquisitions 
it is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash 
future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments  changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment

we currently anticipate that during the next months  our capital expenditures will be in the range of million to million  principally for machinery and equipment for new business  including new process technology within our mechanical operations  maintenance levels of machinery and equipment and information technology infrastructure upgrades 
we believe that our level of resources  which include cash on hand  available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  additional proceeds available under our trade accounts receivable securitization programs and potentially available under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs and funds provided by operations  will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures  the payment of any declared quarterly dividends  payments for current and future restructuring activities and our working capital requirements for the next months 
our million asset backed securitization program and our million foreign asset backed securitization program expire  however  in march and our million and million uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs expire in may and august  respectively  and we may be unable to renew any or all of them 
should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities or undertake significant additional expansion activities  our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable

in the contractual obligations table above  we have elected to apply interest rates applicable to the current fiscal quarter to determine the value of these future interest payments 
b during the first fiscal quarter of  we committed million to an independent private equity limited partnership which invests in companies that address resource limits in energy  water and materials commonly referred to as the cleantech sector 
of that amount  we have invested million as of august  the remaining commitment of million is callable over the next three years by the general partner 
as the capital calls have no specified timing  this commitment has been excluded from the above table as we cannot currently determine when such commitment calls will occur 
c at august   we have million and million recorded as a current and a long term liability  respectively  for uncertain tax positions 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments  or the amount by which our liability for these uncertain tax positions will increase or decrease over time  and accordingly  this liability has been excluded from the above table
