sunpower on september   the first day of our fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the distribution of all of our million shares of sunpower class b common stock to our stockholders the spin off 
the distribution was made pro rata to our stockholders of record as of the close of trading on september  as a result of the spin off  each stockholder received approximately of a share of sunpower class b common stock for each share of our common stock held by such stockholder 
the market value of the distribution was approximately billion based on the closing price of sunpower common stock on september  we received a favorable ruling from the internal revenue service in april with respect to certain tax issues arising under section of the internal revenue code in connection with the spin off 
the distribution was structured to be tax free to us and our stockholders for us federal income tax purposes  except in respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares 

table of contents discontinued operations attributable to cypress our historical consolidated financial statements have been recast to account for sunpower as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
accordingly  we have reflected the results of operations of sunpower prior to the spin off as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the assets  liabilities and minority interest related to sunpower were reclassified and reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets 
unless otherwise indicated  the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form k relate solely to the discussion of our continuing operations 
our former subsidiary  sunpower  announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal that certain of its previously issued financial statements could no longer be relied upon 
in the course of the preparation of this annual report on form k  we evaluated the information available to us to date with respect to sunpower s ongoing investigation of its historical financial statements and concluded that such information would not give rise to a material impact on our previously issued financial statements 
adjustments to cypress s stock plans on august   the board approved certain adjustments to cypress s plan and amended plan together  the plans and outstanding employee equity awards in anticipation of the spin off see note 
these adjustments were consistent with and similar to the provisions in the plans providing for automatic adjustment of service provider equity awards and share pools pursuant to a stock split or similar change in capitalization effected without receipt of consideration by us 
specifically  the board approved amendments to the plans to preserve the intrinsic value of the awards before and after the spin off since only common stock holders  not equity plan holders were able to receive the sunpower stock distribution 
in addition  the board approved certain adjustments with respect to our employee stock purchase plan espp to offset the decrease in common stock price resulting from the spin off 
these changes included a proportionate adjustment in the offering date price per share of common stock and maximum number of shares participants may purchase under the espp 
on september   following the spin off  outstanding employee equity awards under the plans were adjusted by a conversion ratio of the conversion ratio 
the number of authorized but unissued shares reserved for issuance under the plans and the espp and the numerical provisions under the plans annual grant limits and automatic option grant provisions  including automatic grants to board members  were also impacted by the conversion ratio 
the modification of the outstanding employee equity awards and the espp on august  resulted in additional non cash stock based compensation 
the amount was measured based upon the difference between the fair value of the awards immediately before and after the modification 
of the total additional non cash stock based compensation million and million  net of forfeitures was recognized in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the remaining million will be recognized over the remaining vesting periods on an accelerated basis less forfeitures 
convertible debt maturity on september   our outstanding notes of approximately million in principal matured and were settled 
holders received cash for the principal amount of the notes and the entire premium 
the final conversion price per notes as calculated under the indenture  was  including principal and premium 
consistent with the terms of the indenture  on september   we paid approximately million for the principal amount of notes  premium and accrued and unpaid interest 

table of contents convertible note hedge and warrants in connection with the issuance of the notes  we had a convertible note hedge transaction with respect to our common stock with two counterparties  at the equivalent amount of common stock that would be issuable upon conversion of the notes 
the objective of this hedge was to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes in the event that the market value per share of our common stock at the time of exercise is greater than the conversion price of the notes 
in addition  we had entered into a warrant transaction in which we sold to the same counterparties warrants to acquire the same number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes 
on september   the hedge matured and as a result we received million from the counterparties 
in addition  we repurchased and settled the outstanding warrants  issued in march  through a cash payment of approximately million to the counterparties holding the warrants 
manufacturing strategy our core manufacturing strategy flexible manufacturing combines capacity from leading foundries with output from our internal manufacturing facilities 
this initiative should allow us to meet rapid swings in customer demand while lessening the burden of high fixed costs  a capability that is particularly important in high volume consumer markets that we serve with our leading programmable product portfolio 
consistent with this strategy  our board approved a plan in december to exit our manufacturing facility in texas and transfer production to our more cost competitive facility in minnesota and outside foundries 
we substantially completed our exit plan by the end of fiscal we continued to hold the property for sale as of january  results of operations revenues year ended january  december  december  in thousands consumer and computation division data communications division memory and imaging division emerging technologies and other total revenues consumer and computation division revenues from the consumer and computation division decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately million in sales of our usb products mainly due to the economic slowdown impacting demand in pc applications and consumer devices and increased competition in the consumer market 
the decrease was also attributable to a decrease of million in sales of our general purpose timing solutions resulting from reduced demand from certain large consumer and personal computer customers 
the decrease was partly offset by an increase in our psoc product families 
despite the challenging economic environment  our psoc product families  including our touchscreen family  continued to gain new design wins  expand their customer base and increase market penetration in a variety of end market applications particularly in mobile handsets 
revenues from the consumer and computation division decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the distributor conversion contributed million of the decrease between fiscal periods

after giving effect to the distributor conversion  revenues from our psoc solutions were unchanged in fiscal compared to fiscal data communications division revenues from the data communications division decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in sales of our specialty memory products due to the continued slow down in demand in the base station market and our programmable logic devices primarily due to the decline in military and certain end of life shipments 
revenues from the data communications division increased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in sales of our west bridge controllers and other products resulting from increased production and shipments to cell phone manufacturers 
this increase was partially offset by million in sales of our network search engine products as we divested the product families during fiscal  and a decrease of million in sales of our physical layer devices primarily due to the decline in military shipments 
memory and imaging division revenues from the memory and imaging division decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the economic slowdown impacting us by reducing sales by million of our sram products in networking  consumer and communications applications

table of contents cost of revenue decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and gross margin percentage decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the gross margin decrease is primarily attributable to higher stock compensation of million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to sunpower spin off 
the increase in stock based compensation was mainly related to certain performance based awards 
additionally  the gross margin percentage was also unfavorably impacted by inventory write downs  under absorbed costs and reduced revenue in as a result of the challenging economic conditions as we proactively reduced wafer starts in early to match supply with demand 
the decrease in the gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to reduced factory utilization as we proactively managed inventory levels to a lowered end customer demand resulting from the economic downturn 
in addition  stock based compensation expense allocated to cost of revenues increased million mainly due to the modification of the outstanding employee equity awards approved by the board in connection with the spin off 
gross margin has also been impacted by the timing of inventory adjustments related to inventory write downs and the subsequent sale of these written down products caused by the general state of our business 
during fiscal  the net impact of the inventory adjustments was a charge of million compared to a charge of million in fiscal research and development r d year ended january  december  december  in thousands r d expenses as a percentage of revenues r d expenditures decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a million reduction in employee related labor and other costs associated with the implementation of our fiscal restructuring plan

table of contents interest income interest income decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily driven by the impact of lower market interest rates 
interest income decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to lower average cash balances in the second half of due to the reduction of our outstanding debt discussed below  the impact of lower market interest rates and the shift of our portfolio to safer and more liquid investments 
interest expense in may  guidance was issued which clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlement 
this guidance specifies that an issuer of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer s non convertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods 
this guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and retrospective application was required for all periods presented 
we adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal see note of our consolidated financial statements 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the conversion element of the outstanding notes which resulted in the recording of million non cash interest expense in fiscal as a result of our retrospective application of the new guidance on convertible debt and lower outstanding debt balances in fiscal year due to the note tender offer discussed below

they are usually found in the form of municipal bonds  preferred stock  a pool of student loans or collateralized debt obligations with interest rates resetting every seven to days through an auction process 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
the auction rate securities held by us are primarily backed by student loans and are over collateralized  insured and guaranteed by the united states federal department of education 
as of january   of our auction rate securities held by us were rated as either aaa or aaa by the major independent rating agencies and approximately of the student loan auction rate securities held by us have been downgraded from aaa or aaa to baa the downgrade event was due to the higher rates the issuer is paying out versus the lending rates  which is preventing the issuer from building excess spread as required under the prospectus 
if the financial market continues to deteriorate  future downgrades could potentially impact the rating of our auction rate securities 
as of january   all of our auction rate securities have experienced failed auctions due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
these failures are not believed to be a credit issue with the underlying investments  but 
table of contents rather caused by a lack of liquidity 
under the contractual terms  the issuer is obligated to pay penalty rates should an auction fail 
the funds associated with failed auctions are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
given these circumstances and the lack of liquidity  our auction rate securities totaling million are classified as long term investments as of january  during fiscal  we performed analyses to assess the fair value of the auction rate securities 
in the absence of a liquid market to value these securities  we prepared a valuation model based on discounted cash flows 
the assumptions used at january  were as follows years to liquidity  continued receipt of contractual interest which provides a premium spread for failed auctions  and discount rates of  which incorporates a spread for both credit and liquidity risk 
based on these assumptions  we estimated that the auction rate securities would be valued at approximately of their stated par value as of january   representing a decline in value of approximately million 
as a result of our adoption of new guidance in the second quarter of  we reclassified the non credit portion of the previously recognized other than temporary impairment losses related to our auction rate securities of million from accumulated deficit to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
equity securities we have equity investments in both public and privately held companies 
we recognize an impairment charge when the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is deemed other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge on an investment in a public company  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
our impairment assessment on investments in privately held companies includes the review of each investee s financial condition  the business outlook for its products and technology  its projected results and discounted cash flows  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or others 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount  we presume that the investment is impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise 
we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  as we determined that the decline in value of our equity investments in certain public and privately held companies was other than temporary 
employee deferred compensation plan we have a deferred compensation plan  which provides certain key employees  including our executive management  with the ability to defer the receipt of compensation in order to accumulate funds for retirement on a tax free basis 
we do not make contributions to the deferred compensation plan and we do not guarantee returns on the investments 
participant deferrals and investment gains and losses remain our assets and are subject to claims of general creditors 
we account for the deferred compensation plan in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance  under which  the assets are recorded at fair value in each reporting period with the offset being recorded in other income expense  net 
the liabilities are recorded at fair value in each reporting period with the offset being recorded as an operating expense or income 

table of contents all non cash expense and income recorded under the deferred compensation plan were included in the following line items in the consolidated statements of operations year ended january  december  december  in thousands changes in fair value of assets recorded in other income expense  net changes in fair value of liabilities recorded in cost of revenues r d expenses sg a expenses total income expense  net income taxes we recorded an income tax expense of million in fiscal  compared to an expense of million in fiscal and an expense of million in fiscal the tax expense in fiscal was primarily attributable to income taxes associated with the our non us operations 
the tax expense in fiscal was attributable to non deductible goodwill impairment and debt extinguishment losses  utilization of foreign tax credits and the amortization of deferred tax liabilities associated with purchased intangible assets  partially offset by non us taxes on income earned in certain countries that was not offset by current year net operating losses in other countries and us federal alternative minimum tax and state taxes 
the tax expense in fiscal was attributable to non us taxes on income earned in certain countries that was not offset by current year net operating losses in other countries and us federal and state alternative minimum tax  partially offset by the amortization of deferred tax liabilities associated with purchased intangible assets 
our effective tax rate varies from the us statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries taxed at different rates and a full valuation allowance on net operating losses incurred in the us the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we regularly assess our tax positions in light of legislative  bilateral tax treaty  regulatory and judicial developments in the many countries in which we and our affiliates do business 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we resolved the swiss income tax examination for fiscal no material adjustments were proposed 
the irs is currently conducting audits of our federal income tax returns for fiscal   and as of january   no adjustments to the tax liabilities have been proposed by the irs 
however  the irs has not completed their examination and there can be no assurance that there will be no material adjustments upon completion of their review 
in addition  non us tax authorities have completed their examination of our subsidiary in india for fiscal years and as of january   the proposed adjustments are being appealed 
we believe the ultimate outcome of this appeal will not result in a material adjustment to the tax liability

currently  these failures are not believed to be a credit issue with the underlying investments  but rather caused by a lack of liquidity 
we have classified our auction rate securities totaling million as long term investments as of january  during fiscal  we performed analyses to assess the fair value of the auction rate securities 
in the absence of a liquid market to value these securities  we prepared a valuation model based on discounted cash flows 
based on the discounted cash flows  we estimated that the auction rate securities would be valued at approximately of their stated par value as of january  as a result of our adoption of new guidance in fiscal  we reclassified the non credit portion of the previously recognized other than temporary impairment losses related to our auction rate securities of million from accumulated deficit to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
stock repurchase program in fiscal  the board authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million 
in fiscal  the board approved an additional million  bringing the total amount that may have been used for stock purchases to million under the stock repurchase program 
the stock repurchase program was in addition to the accelerated share repurchase program associated with the notes 

table of contents during fiscal  we used million in cash to repurchase a total of approximately million shares at an average share price of 
approximately million shares of this repurchase occurred prior to the spin off at an average stock price of 
the remaining million shares were purchased after the spin off at an average price of 
during fiscal  we used million to repurchase approximately million shares at an average share price of 
in light of certain tax constraints placed on us in connection with the tax free spin of sunpower  we had no current intentions of repurchasing additional stock under the existing program 
accordingly  on october   the audit committee of the board voted to rescind the remaining million available under the program for additional repurchases 
equity option contracts as of december   we had outstanding a series of equity options on our common stock with an initial cost of million that were originally entered into in fiscal the contracts required physical settlement 
upon expiration of the options  if our stock price was above the threshold price of per share  we would receive a settlement value totaling million in cash 
if our stock price was below the threshold price of per share  we would receive million shares of our common stock 
during fiscal  the contracts expired and we did not renew them 
we received million shares of our common stock  which was accounted for as treasury stock 
on october  the audit committee approved a yield enhancement strategy intended to improve the yield on our available non strategic cash 
as part of this program  the audit committee authorized us to enter into short term yield enhanced structured agreements correlated to our stock price 
in one such structure  we pay a fixed sum of cash upon execution of an agreement in exchange for the counterparty s obligations to pay either a pre determined amount of cash or shares of our stock depending on the closing market price of its common stock on the expiration date of the agreement 
upon expiration of each agreement  if the closing market price of our common stock is above the pre determined price  we will have our cash investment returned plus a yield substantially above the yield available today for short term cash investments 
if the closing market price is at or below the pre determined price  we will receive the number of shares specified at the agreement s inception 
as the outcome of these arrangements is based entirely on our stock price and does not require us to deliver either shares or cash  other than the original investment  the entire transaction is recorded in equity 
the decision to enter into a yield enhanced structured agreement is based upon a comparison of the yields available in the financial markets for similar maturities against the expected yield to be realized per the structured agreement and the related risks associated with this type of arrangement 
we believe the risk associated with these types of agreements is no different than alternative investments available to us with equivalent counterparty credit ratings 
all counterparties to a yield enhancement program have a credit rating of at least aa or a as rated by major independent rating agencies 
for all such agreements that matured in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the yields of the structured agreements were far superior to the yields available in the financial markets primarily due to the volatility of our stock price and the pre payment aspect of the agreements 
the counterparty is willing to pay a premium over the yields available in the financial markets due to the structure of the agreement 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into short term yield enhanced structured agreements totaling million 
we settled these agreements in the fourth quarter of fiscal and received million in cash 
in february  we entered into two additional short term yield enhanced structured agreements totaling million 
upon settlement of these agreements  we expect to receive million in cash 
however if upon settlement of the agreements our stock price is at or below the pre determined price  we will receive million shares of our common stock 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  payments due by years total and and after in thousands operating lease commitments purchase obligations total contractual obligations purchase obligations primarily include non cancelable purchase orders for materials  services  manufacturing equipment  building improvements and supplies in the ordinary course of business 
purchase obligations are defined as enforceable agreements that are legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including quantity  price and timing 
as of january   our unrecognized tax benefits were million  which were classified as long term liabilities 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments  if any  in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing or outcomes of either actual or anticipated tax audits 
capital resources and financial condition our long term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and debt securities 
as of january   in addition to million in cash and cash equivalents  we had million invested in short term investments for a total cash and short term investment position of million that is available for use in current operations 
in addition  we had million of long term investments primarily consisting of auction rate securities 
we believe that liquidity provided by existing cash  cash equivalents and investments and our borrowing arrangements will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  should prevailing economic conditions and or financial  business and other factors beyond our control adversely affect our estimates of our future cash requirements  we could be required to fund our cash requirements by alternative financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if needed  would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may choose at any time to raise additional capital or debt to strengthen our financial position  facilitate growth  enter into strategic initiatives and provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of other business opportunities that arise 
off balance sheet arrangement during fiscal  we entered into a strategic foundry partnership with grace semiconductor manufacturing corporation grace  pursuant to which we have transferred certain of our proprietary process technologies to grace s shanghai  china facility 
in accordance with a foundry agreement executed in fiscal  we purchase wafers from grace that are produced using these process technologies 
pursuant to a master lease agreement  grace has leased certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment from a financing company 
in conjunction with the master lease agreement  we have entered into a series of guarantees with the financing company for the benefit of grace 
under the guarantees  we have agreed to unconditional guarantees to the financing company of the rental payments payable by grace for the leased equipment under the master lease agreement 
if grace fails to pay any of the quarterly rental payments  we will be obligated to pay such outstanding amounts within days of a written demand from the financing company 
if we fail to pay such amount  interest will accrue at a rate of per annum on any unpaid amounts 
to date  we have not been required to make any payments under these guarantees 

table of contents pursuant to the guarantees  we issued irrevocable letters of credit to secure the rental payments under the guarantees in the event a demand is made by the financing company on us 
the amount available under the letters of credit will decline according to schedules mutually agreed upon by us and the financing company 
if we default  the financing company will be entitled to draw on the letters of credit 
we expect our obligations under the letters of credit to be reduced to zero by the end of fiscal in connection with the guarantees  we were granted options to purchase ordinary shares of grace 
as of january   we determined that the fair value of the guarantees and the options was not material to our consolidated financial statements

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance surrounding noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements an amendment to existing authoritative literature 
the newly issued guidance requires recharacterizing minority interests as noncontrolling interests in addition to classifiying noncontrolling interest as a component of equity 
the guidance also establishes reporting requirements to provide disclosures that identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of noncontrolling owners 
this guidance requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests all other requirements are to be applied prospectively 
all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements reflect the presentation and disclosure required by this guidance 
all other requirements under the guidance are being applied prospectively 
we adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal except for the presentation and disclosure requirements required by this guidance  there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  we adopted new accounting guidance which clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments as issued by the fasb 
the guidance specifies that an issuer of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer s non convertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods 
the guidance was effective in the first quarter of  and retrospective application is required for all periods presented 
as a result of our adoption of this accounting guidance we recorded additional non cash interest and other income expense of approximately million and during fiscal and  respectively 
in april  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities 
the accounting guidance relates to determining fair values when there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales 
it reaffirms that the objective of fair value measurement is to reflect how much an asset would be sold for in an orderly transaction as opposed to a distressed forced transaction at the date of the financial statements under current market conditions 
specifically  it reaffirms the need to use judgment to ascertain if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when markets have become inactive 
the new guidance was effective in the second quarter of the adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued new accounting guidance amending the other than temporary impairment guidance for debt securities and it improves the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements 
this guidance does not amend existing recognition and measurement guidance related to other than temporary impairments of equity securities 
under this guidance  if the debt security s market value is below amortized cost and we intend to either sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery  we would record an other than temporary impairment charge to other income and expense  net 
if we do not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery  the revised guidance requires us to determine the portion of the other than temporary impairment related to credit factors  or the credit loss portion  and the portion that is not related to credit factors  or the non credit loss portion 
the credit loss portion is the difference between the amortized cost of the security and our best estimate of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security and is recorded as a charge to other income and expense  net 
the non credit loss portion is the difference between the decline in fair value and the credit loss portion of the other than temporary impairment and is recorded as a separate component of 
table of contents other comprehensive income loss 
at adoption  the non credit loss portion of the other than temporary impairment to date is to be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  offset by an entry to the retained earnings as a one time adjustment 
as a result of our adoption of this accounting guidance in the second quarter of  we reclassified the non credit portion of the previously recognized other than temporary impairment losses related to our auction rate securities of million from accumulated deficit to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in january  the fasb issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures  which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  or level  a reporting entity should disclose separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements that is  on a gross basis rather than one net number 
the updated guidance also requires that an entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements for level and level fair value measurements 
the updated guidance is effective for interim or annual financial reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward activity in level fair value measurements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of the updated guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k and the data used to prepare them 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions in the course of such preparation 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts receivable  inventory valuation  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and financial instruments  stock based compensation  litigation and settlement costs  and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies that are affected by significant estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows revenue recognition we generate revenues by selling products to distributors  various types of manufacturers including original equipment manufacturers oems and electronic manufacturing service providers emss 
we recognize revenue on sales to oems and emss provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
sales to certain distributors are made under agreements which provide the distributors with price protection  other allowances and stock rotation under certain circumstances 
given the uncertainties associated with the rights given to these distributors  revenues and costs related to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the end customers 
revenues are recognized upon receiving notification from those distributors that products have been sold to the end customers 
reported information includes product resale price  quantity and end customer shipment information as well as remaining inventory on hand 
at the time of shipment to those distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to receive payment  relieve inventory for the value of goods shipped since legal title has passed 
table of contents to the distributors  and defer the related margin as deferred revenue less cost of revenue on sales to distributors in the consolidated balance sheets 
the effects of distributor price adjustments are recorded as a reduction to deferred revenue at the time the distributors sell the products to the end customers 
we record as a reduction to revenues reserves for sales returns  price protection and allowances  based upon historical experience rates and for any specific known customer amounts 
we also provide certain distributors and emss with volume pricing discounts  such as rebates and incentives  which are recorded as a reduction to revenues at the time of sale 
historically these volume discounts have not been significant 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent  accurate and timely data from our distributors 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
because the data set is large and complex and because there may be errors in the reported data  we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
actual results could vary materially from those estimates 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable by considering factors such as historical bad debt experience  specific customer creditworthiness  the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic trends that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if the data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our results of operations could be materially affected 
valuation of inventories management periodically reviews the adequacy of our inventory reserves 
we record a write down for our inventories which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
we perform a detailed review of inventories each quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts  product life cycle status  product development plans and current sales levels 
as of january   we had total raw materials of million  work in process of million and finished goods of million 
inventory reserves are not relieved until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
our inventories may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if there were a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to record additional write downs  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
valuation of long lived assets our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities and equipment that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly under utilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand 
in addition  we have recorded intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value  and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analysis 
if there is a significant adverse change 
table of contents in our business in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges on our long lived assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed an impairment analysis for our long lived assets and determined that there was no impairment 
valuation of goodwill we tested our goodwill on the reporting unit level 
we have one reporting unit in our consumer and computation division that has goodwill 
management determines the fair value of our reporting unit using a combination of the income approach  which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the reporting unit  and the market approach  which is based on a competitor multiple assessment  if available 
for our reporting unit  we weight the income approach and the market approach 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows  including the discount rates  estimated terminal values and five year annual growth rates  reflect management s best estimates 
the discount rates were based upon our weighted average cost of capital as adjusted for the risks associated with our operations 
we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for our reporting unit 
we performed our annual assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill balance during the fourth quarter of fiscal our annual assessment did not result in an impairment charge 
in fiscal  as a result of the significant negative industry and economic trends affecting our operations and expected future growth as well as the general decline of industry valuations impacting our assessment  we determined that a portion of our goodwill was other than temporarily impaired and recorded an impairment loss of million 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or growth rates on our remaining reporting unit are not achieved  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
fair value of financial instruments effective december   we adopted the provisions of the accounting guidance  which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
our financial assets and financial liabilities that require recognition under the guidance include available for sale investments  employee deferred compensation plan and foreign currency derivatives 
the guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
as such  fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measure 
the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment 
financial assets utilizing level inputs include us treasuries  most money market funds  marketable equity securities and our employee deferred compensation plan  
table of contents level valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable  directly or indirectly 
financial assets and liabilities utilizing level inputs include foreign currency forward exchange contracts  most commercial paper and corporate notes and bonds  and level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
financial assets utilizing level inputs primarily include auction rate securities 
we use an income approach valuation model to estimate the exit price of the auction rate securities  which is derived as the weighted average present value of expected cash flows over various periods of illiquidity  using a risk adjusted discount rate that is based on the credit risk and liquidity risk of the securities 
availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and to the extent that valuation is based on inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market  the determination of fair value requires more judgment 
accordingly  the degree of judgment exercised by our management in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
in regards to our auction rate securities  the income approach valuation model was based on both level credit quality and interest rates and level inputs 
we determined that the level inputs were the most significant to the overall fair value measurement  particularly the estimates of risk adjusted discount rates and ranges of expected periods of illiquidity 
stock based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of the guidance  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the awards 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our future stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded 
litigation and settlement costs from time to time  we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement payments 
if that occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation is probable  and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such litigation  we will record the loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could require us to record additional legal costs 
accounting for income taxes our global operations involve manufacturing  research and development and selling activities 
profits from non us activities are subject to local country taxes but are not subject to us tax until repatriated to the us it is our intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent 
table of contents and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination is made 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risks our investment portfolio consists of a variety of financial instruments that exposes us to interest rate risk  including  but not limited to  money market funds  commercial paper and corporate securities 
these investments are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our balance sheets at fair market value with their related unrealized gain or loss reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
due to the relatively short term nature of our investment portfolio  we do not believe that an immediate increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
since we believe we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
auction rate securities as of january   all our auction rate securities are classifies as level financial instruments 
auction rate securities are investments with contractual maturities generally between and years 
the auction rate securities held by us are primarily backed by student loans and are over collateralized  insured and guaranteed by the us federal department of education 
as of january   of our auction rate securities held by us were rated as either aaa or aaa by the major independent rating agencies and approximately of the student loan auction rate securities have been downgraded from aaa or aaa to baa the downgrade event was due to the higher rates the issuer is paying out versus the lending rates  which is preventing the issuer from building excess spread as required under the prospectus 
if the financial market continues to deteriorate  future downgrades could potentially impact the rating of our auction rate securities 
as of january   all of our auction rate securities have experienced failed auctions due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
these failures are not believed to be a credit issue with the underlying investments  but rather caused by a lack of liquidity 
under the contractual terms  the issuer is obligated to pay penalty rates should an auction fail 
the funds associated with failed auctions are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
given these circumstances and the lack of liquidity  we have classified our auction rate securities totaling million as long term investments as of january  during fiscal  we performed analyses to assess the fair value of the auction rate securities 
in the absence of a liquid market to value these securities  we prepared a valuation model based on discounted cash flows 
the assumptions used at january  were as follows years to liquidity  
table of contents continued receipt of contractual interest which provides a premium spread for failed auctions  and discount rates of  which incorporates a spread for both credit and liquidity risk 
based on these assumptions  we estimated that the auction rate securities would be valued at approximately of their stated par value as of january   representing a decline in value of approximately million 
as a result of our adoption of new guidance in the second quarter of  we reclassified the non credit portion of the previously recognized other than temporary impairment losses related to our auction rate securities of million from accumulated deficit to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the following table summarizes certain information related to our auction rate securities as of january  fair value fair value given a basis point increase in interest rates fair value given a basis point decrease in interest rates in thousands auction rate securities investments in publicly traded and privately held companies we have equity investments in certain publicly traded companies 
the marketable equity securities are classified as available for sale investments and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gain loss reported as a component in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of the common stock is subject to market price volatility 
the following table summarizes certain information related to these investments as of january  investments fair value fair value given a increase in stock prices fair value given a decrease in stock prices in thousands marketable equity securities we also have equity investments in several privately held companies  many of which are start ups or in development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
as our equity investments generally do not permit us to exert significant influence or control  these amounts generally represent our cost of the investments  less any adjustments we make when we determine that an investment s net realizable value is less than its carrying cost 
during fiscal  we recorded total impairment charges of million related to our investments in certain companies as the carrying value of such investments exceeded the fair value and the decline in value was deemed other than temporary 
as of january   the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was million 
foreign currency exchange risk we operate and sell products in various global markets 
as a result  we are exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar may adversely affect our operating margins 
for example  when foreign currencies appreciate against the us dollar  expenses denominated in foreign currencies become more expensive 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive for international customers  thus potentially leading to a reduction in demand  sales and profitability 
furthermore  many of our competitors are non us companies that could benefit from such a currency fluctuation  making it more difficult for us to compete with those companies 
historically we have limited our hedging activities to the balance sheet using currency forward contracts between us dollars and euro as our revenue and expenses are predominantly recorded in the us dollar except for local expenses outside the us
