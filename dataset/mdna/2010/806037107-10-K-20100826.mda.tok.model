item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below for a discussion of the amount of the company s net sales contributed by product categories 
industry overview the distribution channels for specialty technology products generally consist of manufacturers  wholesale distributors such as scansource  resellers and end users 
the sales channel for specialty technology products typically evolves through a three stage process i direct sales by manufacturers to end users  ii single tier distribution in which manufacturers sell to resellers who  in turn  sell directly to end users  and iii two tier  or wholesale distribution  in which manufacturers sell to wholesale distributors  including scansource  who sell only to resellers who  in turn  sell directly to end users 

table of contents 
index to financial statements currently  the technology products wholesale distribution channel is served by both broad line and specialty distributors 
the broad line distributors are engaged primarily in conventional order fulfillment and typically offer their reseller customers less support and fewer value added services than do specialty distributors 
the specialty distributors that compete with scansource are generally smaller  both in terms of size and geographic area covered 
competition among an expanding number of manufacturers typically causes product prices to decrease and product applications to expand  which has resulted in an increasing number of resellers entering the market in order to support a broader base of potential end users 
as the number of resellers and end users has grown  competition among manufacturers and within the reseller channel has intensified 
because many specialty technology manufacturers develop products that represent only one part of a total solution  most products eventually are developed to provide interoperability among products from multiple manufacturers 
as a result of interoperability  a variety of manufacturers products are typically configured together to create a system solution 
therefore  both manufacturers and resellers have become more dependent upon value added wholesale distributors such as scansource for the aggregation of products and reseller support services  as well as the organization and maintenance of an efficient market structure 
in addition  manufacturers that face declining product prices and rising costs of direct sales increasingly rely upon value added wholesale distributors by outsourcing certain support functions  such as product assortment  delivery  inventory management  technical assistance  and marketing 
at the same time  shortened product life cycles and the introduction of new products and applications have caused resellers increasingly to rely on wholesale distributors for various inventory management  financing  technical support and related functions 
the company believes that as the reseller market grows and becomes more fragmented  and as specialty technology products continue to transition to open systems  the wholesale distribution channel in which the company operates will become increasingly more important 
vendors the company s key vendors for its scansource pos and barcoding sales unit are cisco  datalogic  elo  epson america  honeywell  ibm  intermec  lxe  motorola  ncr  and zebra technologies 
the company s key vendors in its catalyst telecom sales unit are aruba  avaya  extreme networks  juniper networks  plantronics and polycom 
the company s key vendors for its scansource communications sales unit are audiocodes  dialogic  plantronics  and polycom 
the company s key vendors for its scansource security sales unit are axis  cisco  hid  panasonic  sony and zebra card 
the company has approximately hardware and software vendors that currently supply its products 
of all of the company s vendors  only two  motorola and avaya  each constitute more than of the company s net sales 
the company s products are typically purchased directly from the manufacturer on a non exclusive basis 
the company s agreements with its vendors generally do not restrict the company from selling similar or comparable products manufactured by competitors 
the company has the flexibility to terminate or curtail sales of one product line in favor of another due to technological change  pricing considerations  product availability  customer demand  or vendor distribution policies 
the company has written distribution agreements with its key vendors and with almost all of its vendors 
these agreements are in the form that the company believes are customarily used by manufacturers and distributors 
the company s agreements generally provide it with non exclusive distribution rights and often include territorial restrictions that limit the countries in which the company can distribute its products 
these agreements typically provide the company with stock rotation and price protection provisions 
stock rotation rights give the company the ability  subject to certain limitations  to return for credit or exchange a portion of those inventory items purchased from the vendor 
price protection situations occur when a vendor credits the company for declines in inventory value resulting from the vendor s price reductions 
along with the company s inventory management policies and practices  these provisions are designed to reduce the company s risk of loss due to slow moving inventory  vendor price reductions  product updates or obsolescence 

table of contents 
index to financial statements some of the company s distribution agreements contain minimum purchase requirements that the company must meet in order to receive preferential prices 
the company participates in various rebate  cash discount and cooperative marketing programs offered by its vendors to support expenses associated with distributing and marketing the vendor s products 
the rebates and purchase discounts are generally influenced by sales volumes and are subject to change 
the company s distribution agreements are generally short term  subject to periodic renewal  and provide for termination by either party without cause upon to days notice 
the company s vendors generally warrant the products the company distributes and allow returns of defective products  including those returned to the company by its customers 
the company generally does not independently warrant the products it distributes  however  local laws may in some cases impose warranty obligations on the company 
the company s merchandising department recruits vendors and manages important aspects of its vendor relationships  such as purchasing arrangements  cooperative marketing initiatives  vendor sales force relationships  product training  monitoring of rebate programs and various contract terms and conditions 
customers the company s reseller customers currently include over  active value added reseller accounts vars located in the united states  canada  mexico  latin america and europe 
no single customer accounted for more than of the company s total net sales for the fiscal year ended june  the company generally targets two types of reseller customers specialty technology vars these resellers focus on selling specialty technology products as tailored software or integrated hardware solutions for their end users existing applications or incorporating specialty technology products into customized technology solutions for their end users 
primary industries served by these resellers include manufacturing  distribution  health care  pharmaceutical  hospitality  government  convenience  grocery  financial  and other retail markets 
networking or pc vars these resellers develop computer solutions and networking for their end users microcomputer needs 
they typically have well established relationships with end user management information system directors and are seeking additional revenue and profit opportunities in related technology markets  such as aidc  pos  security  or communications 
sales and electronic commerce the company s sales department consists primarily of inside sales representatives located in the united states  canada  mexico  belgium  france  germany  the united kingdom  and the netherlands 
in order to build strong customer relationships  most active resellers are assigned to a sales representative 
each sales representative negotiates pricing directly with their assigned customers 
the company also employs business development representatives who are responsible for developing technical expertise within broad product markets  recruiting customers  creating demand  and reviewing overall product and service requirements of resellers 
each sales representative and business development representative receives comprehensive training with respect to the technical characteristics of each vendor s products 
this training is supplemented by frequent product seminars conducted by vendors representatives and bi weekly meetings among product  marketing and sales managers 

table of contents 
index to financial statements increasingly  customers rely upon the company s electronic ordering and information systems  in addition to its product catalogs and frequent mailings  as sources for product information  including availability and price 
through the company s website  most customers can gain remote access to the company s information systems to check real time product availability  see their customized pricing and place orders 
customers can also follow the status of their orders and obtain united parcel service ups and federal express fedex package tracking numbers from this site 
marketing the company provides a range of marketing services  including cooperative advertising with vendors through trade publications and direct mail  product catalogs for each of the north american  european and latin american markets  periodic newsletters  management of sales leads  trade shows with hardware and software companies and vendors  direct mail  and sales promotions 
in addition  the company organizes and operates its own seminars and teams with top vendors to recruit prospective resellers and introduce new applications for the specialty technology products it distributes 
the company frequently customizes its marketing services for vendors and resellers 
value added services in addition to the basic order fulfillment and credit services that conventional wholesale distributors typically provide to resellers  the company differentiates itself by providing an array of value added services and business tools that assist resellers to provide more complete solutions and improve customer service 
such services include custom configuration  professional services  technical support  partner marketing  web storefronts  custom packaging  and other specialized services 
operations information system the company s information system is a scalable  centralized processing system capable of supporting numerous operational functions including purchasing  receiving  order processing  shipping  inventory management and accounting 
sales representatives rely on the information system for on line  real time information on product pricing  inventory availability and reservation  and order status 
the company s warehouse operations use bar code technology for receiving and shipping  and automated ups and fedex systems for freight processing and shipment tracking  each of which is integrated with the company s information system 
the customer service and technical support departments employ the system for documentation and faster processing of customer product returns 
to ensure that adequate inventory levels are maintained  the company s buyers depend on the system s purchasing and receiving functions to track inventory on a continual basis 
central warehouse and shipping the company operates a  square foot distribution center in southaven  mississippi  which is located near the fedex hub facility in memphis  tennessee and serves all of north america 
the company utilizes a third party warehouse located in liege  belgium and a warehouse in cologne  germany that serves all of europe  including the united kingdom 
the company has additional warehouse facilities in florida and mexico  which serve latin america including mexico 
the company believes that its centralized distribution creates several advantages  including i a reduced amount of safety stock inventory which  in turn  reduces the company s working capital requirements  ii an increased turnover rate through tighter controls over inventory  iii maintenance of a consistent order fill rate  iv improved personnel productivity  v improved delivery time  vi simplified purchasing and tracking  vii decreased demand for management personnel  and viii flexibility to meet customer needs for systems integration 
the company s objective is to ship all orders on the same day  using bar code technology to expedite shipments and minimize shipping errors 
the company offers reduced freight rates and flexible delivery options to minimize a reseller s need for inventory 

table of contents 
index to financial statements financial services the company routinely offers competitive credit terms relative to the specific geographic area for qualified resellers and facilitates various third party financing options  including leasing  flooring  and other secured financing 
the company believes this policy reduces the customer s need to establish multiple credit relationships with a large number of manufacturers 
competition the markets in which the company operates  as identified above  are highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on factors such as price  product availability  speed and accuracy of delivery  effectiveness of sales and marketing programs  credit availability  ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs  quality and breadth of product lines and services  and availability of technical and product information 
in the scansource pos and barcoding sales unit  the company competes with broad line distributors such as avnet  ingram micro  synnex and tech data  in all geographic segments 
additionally  the company also competes against other smaller  more specialized aidc and pos distributors  such as bluestar 
in the catalyst telecom sales unit  the company competes against avnet  ingram micro  jenne  tech data  and voda one 
in the scansource communications sales unit based in north america and in europe  the company competes against ingram micro  nimans  tech data  and westcon 
in the scansource security sales unit  which is based in north america  the company competes against other broad line distributors such as adi  synnex  and tech data and more specialized distributors such as anixter and tri northern 
as the company seeks to expand its business into other areas closely related to the company s offerings  the company may encounter increased competition from current competitors and or from new competitors  some of which may be the company s current customers 
the company s competitors include regional and national wholesale distributors  as well as hardware manufacturers including most of the company s vendors that sell directly to resellers and to end users 
in addition  the company competes with master resellers that sell to franchisees  third party dealers and end users 
certain of the company s current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company has and may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
certain smaller regional competitors  who are specialty two tier or mixed model master resellers  may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition has increased for our sales units over the last several years as broad line and other value added distributors have entered into the specialty technology markets 
such competition could also result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share by the company 
employees as of june   the company had  employees located in north america  latin america including mexico and europe 
only employees located in mexico are considered to be a collective bargaining unit 
the company considers its employee relations to be good 
service marks the company conducts its business under the trademarks and service marks scansource pos and barcode  catalyst telecom  scansource communications  partner services  and scansource security 
the company has been issued registrations for the service marks scansource and catalyst telecom in countries in its principal markets 
these trademarks and service marks do not have value assigned to them and have a designated indefinite life 
the company does not believe that its operations are dependent upon any of its trademarks or service marks 
the company also sells products and provides services under various trademarks  service marks and trade names to which reference is made in this report that are the property of owners other than the company

risk factors 
the following are certain risk factors that could affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
these risks should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
there also are other risks that we may not describe  generally because we currently do not perceive them to be material  which could impact us 
if any of these risks develops into actual events  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected  the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any risk factors  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except as required by law 
global economic instability current world wide economic conditions and market disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
financial markets throughout the world could continue to experience extreme disruption  including  among other things  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations and pricing volatility of others  volatile energy costs  geopolitical issues and failure and potential failures of major financial institutions 
these continuing developments and the related general economic downturn may adversely impact our business and financial condition in a number of ways 
the slowdown could lead to reduced information technology spending by end users  which could adversely affect our sales 
the global economic downturn and instability may also result in changes in vendor terms and conditions  such as rebates  cash discounts and cooperative marketing efforts  which may result in downward pressure on our gross margins 
the tightening of credit in financial markets and the general economic downturn may adversely affect the ability of our reseller customers  vendors and service providers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and to perform their obligations under our agreements with them 
this could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services  could negatively impact our ability to collect our accounts receivable on a timely basis  could result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable being required  and could lead to elevated levels of obsolete inventory 
deterioration in the financial and credit market heightens the risk of customer bankruptcies and delay in payment 
significant volatility and fluctuations in the rates of exchange for the us dollar against currencies such as the euro  could also negatively impact our customer pricing and operating results 
we continue to be unable to predict the duration and severity of the current economic downturn and disruption in financial markets or their effects on our business and results of operations 
people if we cannot continue to hire and retain high quality employees  our business and financial results may be negatively affected 
our operating results could be adversely affected by increased competition for employees  higher employee turnover  or increased salary and benefit costs 
like most businesses  our employees are important to our success and we are dependent in part on our ability to retain the services of our key management  sales  it  operational  finance and administrative personnel 
we have built our business on a set of core values and we attempt to hire employees who are committed to these values 
we want employees who will fit our culture of providing 
table of contents 
index to financial statements exceptional service to our vendors and customers 
in order to compete and to continue to grow  we must attract  retain  and motivate employees  including those in executive  senior management  sales  marketing  logistics  technical support and other operating positions 
many of our employees work in small teams to provide specific services to vendors and customers 
they are trained to develop their knowledge of vendor products  programs and practices  and customer business needs  as well as to enhance the skills required to provide exceptional service and to manage our business 
as they gain experience and develop their knowledge and skills  our employees become highly desired by other businesses 
therefore  to retain our employees  we have to provide a satisfying work environment and competitive compensation and benefits 
if our costs to retain our skilled employees increase  then our business and financial results may be negatively affected 
our continued growth is also dependent  in part  on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management  including but not limited to  michael baur  our chief executive officer 
we may not be successful in retaining the members of our senior management team or our other key employees 
while we have entered into employment agreements with key executives and have obtained a key person life insurance policy on our ceo s life  the loss of the services of mr 
baur or any member of our senior management team could also have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
vendor relationships terminations of a distribution or services agreement or a significant change in supplier terms  authorizations  or lack of product availability  or conditions of sale could negatively affect our operating margins  revenue or the level of capital required to fund our operations 
a significant percentage of our net sales relates to products sold to us by relatively few vendors 
as a result of such concentration risk  terminations of supply or services agreements or a significant change in terms or conditions of sale from one or more of our more significant vendors could negatively affect our operating margins  revenues or the level of capital required to fund our operations 
our vendors have the ability to make significantly adverse changes in their sales terms and conditions  such as reducing the level of purchase discounts and rebates they make available to us 
we have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with our significant vendors 
in certain product categories  limited price protection or return rights offered by our vendors may have a bearing on the amount of product we may be willing to stock 
our inability to pass through to our reseller customers the impact of these changes  as well as our failure to develop systems to manage ongoing vendor programs  could cause us to record inventory write downs or other losses and could have significant negative impact on our gross margins 
we receive purchase discounts and rebates from some vendors based on various factors  including goals for quantitative and qualitative sales or purchase volume and customer related metrics 
certain purchase discounts and rebates may affect gross margins 
many purchase discounts from vendors are based on percentage increases in sales of products 
our operating results could be negatively impacted if these rebates or discounts are reduced or eliminated or if our vendors significantly increase the complexity of process and costs for us to receive such rebates 
our ability to obtain particular products or product lines in the required quantities and to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis is critical to our success 
our manufacturers have experienced product supply shortages from time to time due to the inability of certain suppliers to supply certain products on a timely basis 
as a result  we have experienced  and may in the future continue to experience  short term shortages of specific products 
in addition  vendors who currently distribute their products through us may decide to shift to or substantially increase their existing distribution  through other distributors  their own dealer networks  or directly to resellers or end users 
suppliers have  from time to time  made efforts to reduce the number of distributors with which they do business 
this could result in more intense competition as distributors strive to secure distribution rights with these vendors  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
if vendors are not able to provide us with an adequate supply of products to fulfill our customer orders on a timely basis or we cannot otherwise obtain particular products or a product line or vendors substantially increase their existing distribution through other distributors  their own dealer networks  or directly to resellers  our reputation  sales and profitability may suffer 

table of contents 
index to financial statements customer relationships we operate in a highly competitive environment and good customer relations are critical to our success 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and expand our customer relationships or acquire new customers 
meeting our customers needs quickly and fairly is critical to our business success 
our transactions with our customers are generally performed on a purchase order basis rather than under long term supply agreements 
our customers generally do not have an obligation to purchase from us 
therefore  our customers can readily switch vendors 
from time to time  we experience shortages in availability of some products from vendors  and this impacts our customers decisions regarding whether to make purchases from us 
anything that negatively impacts our customer relations also can negatively impact our operating results 
accordingly  our sales can vary as a result of fluctuations in pricing  product availability  and general competitive and economic conditions 
centralized functions we have centralized a number of functions to provide efficient support to our business 
as a result  a loss or reduction of use of one of our locations could have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial results 
in order to be as efficient as possible  we centralize a number of critical functions 
for instance  we currently distribute products in north america from a single warehouse near memphis  tennessee with corresponding arrangements for our latin american and european markets 
similarly  we utilize a single information system based in greenville  south carolina 
while we have backup systems and business continuity plans  any significant or lengthy interruption of our ability to provide these centralized functions could significantly impair our ability to continue normal business operations 
in addition  the centralization of these functions increases our exposure to local risks  such as the availability of qualified employees and the lessening of competition for critical services  such as freight and communications 
although we have business interruption insurance  not all losses are covered  and an uninsured loss from electrical or telephone failure  fire or other casualty  or other disruption could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  there are limits on all of our insurance coverage  and it is possible that losses might exceed that coverage 
systems our ability to manage our business and monitor results is highly dependent upon information and communication systems 
a failure of these systems could disrupt our business 
we are highly dependent upon a variety of internal computer and telecommunication systems to operate our business 
our customers rely increasingly on our electronic ordering and information systems as a source for product information  including availability and pricing 
there can be no assurance that our systems will not fail or experience disruptions  and any significant failure or disruption of these systems could prevent us from making sales  ordering and delivering products and otherwise conducting our business 
many of our customers use our website to check real time product availability  see their customized pricing and to place orders 
the internet and individual websites have experienced a number of disruptions and slowdowns 
in addition  some websites have experienced security breakdowns 
while our website has not experienced any material disruptions or security breakdowns  any disruptions or breaches in security or a breach that compromises sensitive information could harm our relationship with our vendors  customers and other business partners 
any material disruption of our website or the internet in general could impair our order processing or prevent our vendors and customers from accessing information and cause us to lose business 
in order to continue support of our growth  we plan to make significant technological upgrades to our information systems 
this can be a lengthy and expensive process that may result in a significant diversion of resources from other operations 
in addition  the information systems of companies we acquire may not be sufficient to meet our standards or we may not be able to successfully convert them to provide acceptable information on a timely and cost effective basis 
in addition  we must attract and retain qualified people to operate our systems  expand and improve them  integrate new programs effectively with our existing programs  
table of contents 
index to financial statements and convert to new systems efficiently when required 
any disruption to our business due to such issues  or an increase in our costs to cover these issues that is greater than what we have anticipated  could have an adverse affect on our financial results and operations 
in addition  the information systems of companies we acquire may not be sufficient to meet our standards or we may not be able to successfully convert them to provide acceptable information on a timely and cost effective basis 
in addition  we must attract and retain qualified people to operate our systems  expand and improve them  integrate new programs effectively with our existing programs  and convert to new systems efficiently when required 
international operations our international operations expose us to risks that are different from  or possibly greater than  the risks we are exposed to domestically 
we currently have facilities in seven countries outside the united states and sell products in a number of others 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations 
these operations are subject to a variety of risks that either are in addition to the risks that we face domestically or are similar risks but with potentially greater exposure 
these risks include changes in international trade laws  such as the north american free trade agreement  affecting our import and export activities  including export license requirements  restrictions on the export of certain technology  and tariff changes  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  changes in  or expiration of  various foreign incentives that provide economic benefits to us  changes in labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire and retain employees  difficulties in staffing and managing operations in foreign countries  fluctuations of foreign currency  exchange controls and currency devaluations  changes in the interpretation and enforcement of laws in particular related to items such as duty and taxation  potential political and economic instability and changes in governments  terrorist or military actions that result in destruction or seizure of our assets or suspension or disruption of our operations or those of our customers  potential regulatory changes  including foreign environmental restrictions  and different general economic conditions 
because we have operations in canada  mexico and europe  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rate fluctuations may cause our international results to fluctuate significantly when reflected in us dollar terms 
we manage our exposure to fluctuations in the value of currencies using various derivative instruments 
however  we may not be able to mitigate all foreign currency related risk 
in addition  in foreign markets we are more dependent upon third party providers of key services  such as third party freight forwarders and third party warehouses 
adverse changes in any of these third party services could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
as we expand our international operations  we expect these risks to increase 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  the value of our equity investment in foreign countries  such as our purchase of algol europe  gmbh in  may fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these fluctuations may result in losses in the event a foreign subsidiary is sold or closed at a time when the foreign currency is weaker than when we initially invested 
credit exposure we have credit exposure to our reseller customers 
any adverse trends in their businesses could cause us to suffer credit losses 
we have credit exposure to our reseller customers and negative trends in their businesses could increase our credit risk 
as is customary in our industry  we extend credit to our reseller customers and most of our sales are on open accounts 
we may be unable to collect on receivables if our reseller customers experience decreases in demand for their products and services  do not manage their businesses adequately  or otherwise become less able to pay due to adverse economic conditions 
as we grow and compete for business  our typical payment terms tend to be longer  and therefore may increase our credit risk 
while we evaluate resellers qualifications for credit and monitor our extensions of credit  these efforts cannot prevent all credit losses  and credit losses in excess of historical levels would negatively impact our performance 
in addition  for financial reporting purposes we estimate future credit losses and establish an appropriate reserve 
to the extent that our credit losses exceed those reserves  our financial performance will be negatively impacted 
during the past months our operating expenses increased as a result of bad debt expense that we recognized primarily from a single customer 
there is no guarantee that our operating expenses will not increase as a result of the recognition of bad debt expense from our reseller customers 
terrorist or military operations future terrorist or military operations could result in a disruption of our operation or loss of assets in certain markets 
future terrorist or military actions  in the united states or abroad  could result in destruction or seizure of assets or suspension or disruption of our operations 
additionally  such actions could affect the operations of our suppliers or customers  resulting in loss of access to products  potential losses on supplier programs  loss of business  higher losses on receivables or inventory  and or other disruptions in our business  which could negatively affect our operating results 
we do not carry broad insurance covering such terrorist or military actions  and even if we were to seek such coverage  the cost would likely be prohibitive 
narrow profit margins our narrow margins significantly impact our operating results 
our industry is highly competitive and characterized by narrow gross and operating margins 
as a result  we have significant price competition that results in narrow gross profit and operating profit margins 
because these margins are narrow  fluctuations in sales can have a significant impact on our overall operating results 
competition we experience intense competition in all of our markets 
such competition could result in reduced margins and loss of our market share 
the markets that we operate in are highly competitive 
we compete on the basis of price  product availability  speed and accuracy of delivery  effectiveness of sales and marketing programs  credit availability  ability to tailor solutions to the needs of our customers  quality and breadth of product line and services  and availability of technical and product information 
our competitors include regional and national wholesale distributors as well as hardware manufacturers including most of our vendors that sell directly to resellers and to end users 
in addition  we compete with master resellers that sell to franchisees  third party dealers and end users 
certain of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have and may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
certain smaller  regional competitors  who are specialty two tier or mixed model master resellers  may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements customer requirements 
competition has increased for our sales units as broad line and other value added distributors have entered into the specialty technology markets 
such competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of our market share 
as a result of intense price competition in our industry  our gross margins and our operating profit margins have historically been narrow and we expect them to be narrow in the future 
to remain competitive we may be forced to offer more credit or extended payment terms to our customers 
this could result in an increase in our need for capital  increase our financing costs  increase our bad debt expenses and have a negative impact on our financial results 
growth strategies if we fail to effectively manage and implement our organic growth strategies  we may experience a negative effect on our business and financial results 
a significant component of our growth strategy has been to add new vendors and products  and we expect to be able to enter new product markets in the future 
expansion of our existing product markets and entry into new product markets divert the use of our resources and systems  require additional resources that might not be available or available on acceptable terms  result in new or more intense competition  may require longer implementation times or greater start up expenditures than anticipated  and may otherwise fail to achieve the desired results in a timely fashion  if at all 
in addition  while we have been very successful in adding new vendors in the past  we already represent most of the significant vendors in our primary areas of focus  and there is regular consolidation among our vendors 
as a result  there may be fewer expansion opportunities of this nature in the future 
if we are unable to increase our sales and earnings by expanding our product offerings in a cost effective manner  then our revenues may not grow 
our ability to successfully manage our growth will require continued enhancement of our operational  managerial  and financial resources and controls 
our failure to effectively manage our growth could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
additionally  our growth may increase our working capital requirements and as a result  we may require additional equity or debt financing 
such financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
acquisitions our growth strategy includes potential acquisitions of companies that complement or expand or existing business 
acquisitions involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
we have and expect to continue to acquire companies that complement or expand our business in the united states or internationally 
acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management s attention away from normal business operations  sufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the acquisition  difficulty in the integration of acquired businesses  including new employees  business systems and technology  inability to adapt to challenges of new markets  including geographies  products and services  or to attract new sources of profitable business from expansion of products or services  exposure to new regulations  and issues not discovered in our due diligence process 
our operations may be adversely impacted by an acquisition that i is not suited for us  ii is improperly executed  or iii substantially increases our debt 
any of these factors could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 
inventory the value of our inventory may be adversely affected by market and other factors 
our business  like that of other distributors  is subject to the risk that the value of our inventory will be adversely affected by price reductions by manufacturers or by technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of our products 
under the terms of most of our vendor agreements and the policy of most manufacturers of specialty technology products  we have some price protection and stock rotation opportunities with respect to slow moving or obsolete inventory items 
however  these protections are limited in scope and do not protect against all declines in inventory value  excess inventory  or product obsolescence  and in some instances we may not be able to fulfill all necessary conditions or successfully manage such price protection or stock rotation opportunities 
in addition  these industry practices are sometimes not reflected in vendor 
table of contents 
index to financial statements agreements and their application in a particular situation is dependent upon negotiations between our vendors and us 
as a result  from time to time we are required to write down the value of excess and obsolete inventory  and should any of these write downs occur at a significant level  they could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
should the current economic downturn persist  it is possible that prices may decline due to an oversupply of product  and therefore  there may be a greater risk of declines in inventory value 
in addition  our vendors may become insolvent and unable to fulfill their product obligations to us 
significant declines in inventory value in excess of established inventory reserves or dramatic changes in prevailing technologies could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
laws and regulations changes in tax laws  and other laws and regulations may adversely impact us 
we are subject to a wide range of local  state and federal laws and regulations both in the united states and in the other countries in which we operate 
while we plan our operations based upon existing and anticipated laws and regulations  we cannot anticipate every change and can have only little  if any  impact on others 
we are particularly susceptible to changes in income and other tax laws  laws regulating international trade  and accounting and securities disclosure laws and regulations 
to a lesser degree  changes in environmental regulation  including electronic waste recovery legislation  may impact us 
in each case  a change in the laws or regulations that we are required to comply with could have an adverse impact on our business operations or financial results 
accounting rules changes in accounting rules or standards could have a significant adverse affect on our reported earnings 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles are subject to interpretations by various governing bodies including the financial accounting standards board  the public accounting oversight board  the sec and the american institute of certified public accountants 
these governing bodies create and interpret appropriate accounting standards 
future periodic assessments required by current or new accounting standards may result in additional non cash charges and or changes in presentation or disclosure 
a change from current accounting standards could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
quarterly fluctuations our net sales and operating results are dependent on a number of factors 
our net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and these fluctuations may cause volatility in our stock price 
our net sales and operating results may fluctuate quarterly as a result of changes in demand for our products and services  the introduction of new technology  actions by our competitors  changes in vendors prices or price protection policies  changes in vendors business practices or strategies  changes in freight rates  the timing of the addition of operating expenses to support our growth  the timing of major marketing or other service projects  product supply shortages  changes in product mix  and the general economic factors referenced above 
in addition  a substantial portion of our net sales in each quarter results from orders booked in that quarter  which are difficult to accurately forecast in advance 
as a result  our performance in one period may vary significantly from our performance in the preceding quarter  and may differ significantly from our forecast of performance from quarter to quarter 
the impact of these variances may cause volatility in our stock price 
third party freight carriers we are dependent on third parties for the delivery of a majority of our products 
changes in shipping terms or the failure or inability of our third party shippers to perform could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
we are dependent upon major shipping companies  including federal express and united parcel service  for the shipment of our products to and from our centralized warehouses 
changes in shipping terms  or the

index to financial statements inability of these third party shippers to perform effectively whether as a result of mechanical failure  casualty loss  labor stoppage  or any other reason  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
from time to time  we have experienced significant increases in shipping costs due to increases in fuel costs 
if our shipping costs increase  it may adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass on these higher costs to our customers 
litigation we routinely are involved in litigation that can be costly and lead to adverse results 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are involved in a wide range of disputes  some of which result in litigation 
in addition  as a public company with a large shareholder base  we are susceptible to class action and other litigation resulting from disclosures that we make and our other activities 
litigation is expensive to bring and defend  and the outcome of litigation can be adverse and significant 
not all adverse outcomes can be anticipated  and applicable accounting rules do not always require or permit the establishment of a reserve until a final result has occurred or becomes probable and estimable 
in some instances we are insured for the potential losses  in other instances we are not 
an uninsured adverse outcome in significant litigation could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources market factors may increase the cost and availability of capital 
additional capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms to fund our working capital needs and growth 
our business requires significant levels of capital to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors 
we have an increased demand for capital when our business is expanding  including through acquisitions 
changes in payment terms with either suppliers or customers could increase our capital requirements 
we have historically relied upon cash generated from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  secured and unsecured borrowings  and  to a lesser extent  borrowings under a subsidiary s line of credit to satisfy our capital needs and to finance growth 
while we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will provide sufficient resources to meet our current working capital and cash requirements  if we require capital to meet our future business needs  such capital may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
changes in how lenders rate our credit worthiness  as well as macroeconomic factors such as the current economic downturn and global economic instability may restrict our ability to raise capital in adequate amounts or on terms acceptable to us  and the failure to do so could harm our ability to operate our business 
in addition  our cash and cash equivalents are deposited with various financial institutions located in the various countries in which we operate 
we endeavor to monitor these financial institutions regularly for credit quality  however  we are exposed to risk of loss on such funds or we may experience significant disruptions in our liquidity needs if one or more of these financial institutions were to suffer bankruptcy or similar restructuring

evaluating financial condition and operating performance the company s management places a significant emphasis on operating income and return on invested capital roic in evaluating and monitoring the company s financial condition and operating performance 
roic is used by the company to assess its efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to generate returns 
roic is computed by the company as net income plus income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization divided by invested capital 
invested capital is defined as average equity plus average interest bearing debt for the period

sales to technology resellers in canada accounted for less than of total net sales for both fiscal years presented 
for the fiscal year ended june   net sales for this segment increased by approximately million  or  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the company s north american pos  barcoding  and security product categories saw revenues increase by in comparison to the prior fiscal year 
during the fiscal year ended june   these units experienced stronger demand as economic conditions improved from the prior fiscal year 
sales of substantially all of our major vendors and product lines increased in comparison to the prior fiscal year  as larger deals and projects returned during the fiscal year 
in addition  the company saw strong growth in its security product lines on a comparative basis  driven by its video surveillance and wireless networking lines 
the company has two north american sales units that sell communications products to our customers the catalyst telecom and scansource communications sales units 
the combined sales of these units were higher for the fiscal year ended june  versus the prior fiscal year 
both of these sales units also experienced sales growth due to improved economic conditions as discussed above  and a majority of the vendors in these units saw sales growth compared to the prior year

while total gross profit for the north american distribution segment increased  gross profit  expressed as a percentage of net sales  actually decreased to for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this was largely the result of a less favorable product mix and higher margin dilution due to an increase of larger deals and projects that traditionally carry lower margins 
international distribution despite the increase in sales for the international distribution segment  gross profit actually decreased by million  or for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decline in gross profit for the fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to the absence of strategic inventory purchases in anticipation of subsequent vendor price increases in our european operating segment that occurred in the prior year 
these opportunistic purchases resulted in the achievement of significantly higher gross margins during the second half of the fiscal year

the company s north american pos  barcoding  and security product categories saw revenues decrease by in comparison to the prior fiscal year 
during the fiscal year ended june   all of these units were challenged by weaker end user demand caused by tighter credit markets and uncertain economic conditions in north america 
sales of substantially all of our major vendors and product lines were down in comparison to the prior fiscal year  as many of the larger deals and projects that we normally expect to see during the fiscal year were delayed or even cancelled 
the company has two north american sales units that sell communications products to our customers the catalyst telecom and scansource communications sales units 
the combined sales of these units were lower for the fiscal year ended june  versus the prior fiscal year 
both of these sales units were also impacted by the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in north america discussed above  and a majority of the vendors in these units experienced lower sales on a comparative basis 
for the first six months of the fiscal year ended june   our key vendor in the catalyst telecom sales unit implemented various corrective program changes in response to an unsuccessful new program roll out from the prior fiscal year 
due to the negative reaction surrounding the initial program roll out  in addition to the uncertainty associated with the subsequent changes designed to correct the program  revenues for this sales unit were adversely impacted as reseller purchases were delayed or lost to competitive products during the first half of fiscal we believe that this vendor continues to make progress with its programs  products  and service offerings and we are encouraged that these changes have been well received by our resellers 
accordingly  we attribute the overall lack of demand experienced over the last half of the fiscal year to be driven primarily by the uncertain economic climate and an absence of larger transactions that would normally occur in a more stable economic environment 
international distribution the international distribution segment includes sales to latin america including mexico and europe from the scansource pos and barcoding sales unit and in europe through the scansource communications sales unit 
sales for the overall international segment decreased by  or million  as compared to the prior fiscal year

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory reserves to reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market  and vendor incentives 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  management believes that its estimates  including those for the above described items are reasonable and that the actual results will not vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue once four criteria are met the company must have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery must occur  which happens at the point of shipment this includes the transfer of both title and risk of loss  provided that no significant obligations remain  the price must be fixed and determinable  and collectability must be reasonably assured 
a provision for estimated losses on returns is recorded at the time of sale based on historical experience 
the company has service revenue associated with configuration and marketing  which is recognized when the work is complete and all obligations are substantially met 
the company also sells third party services  such as maintenance contracts 
since the company is acting as an agent for these services  revenue is recognized net of cost at the time of sale 
the company has a self branded warranty program for one product line and buys fulfillment contracts from a third party for most of its obligations 
these revenues and associated third party costs are amortized over the life of contract 
revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated to the various elements based on the relative fair value of the elements  and each revenue cycle is considered a separate accounting unit with recognition of revenue based on the criteria met for the individual element of the multiple deliverables 
allowances for trade and notes receivable the company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from customers failure to make payments on accounts receivable due to the company 
management determines the estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable by considering a number of factors  including historical experience  aging of the accounts receivable and specific information obtained by the company on the financial condition and the current creditworthiness of its customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate and reduce the ability of the company s customers to make payments on their accounts  the company may be required to increase its allowance by recording additional bad debt expense 
likewise  should the financial condition of the company s customers improve and result in payments or settlements of previously reserved amounts  the company may be required to record a reduction in bad debt expense to reverse the recorded allowance 
a provision for estimated losses on returns and allowances is recorded at the time of sale based on historical experience

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal exposure to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business is a result of its selective use of bank debt and transacting business in foreign currencies in connection with its foreign operations 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities  which include revolving credit facilities with a group of banks used to maintain liquidity and fund the company s business operations 
the nature and amount of the company s debt may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on borrowings on the company s revolving credit facility  variable rate long term debt and subsidiary line of credit for the fiscal year ended june  would have resulted in a less than million increase or decrease  respectively  in pre tax income for the period 
to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations associated with the company s variable rate long term debt  the company has implemented an interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of an interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge to minimize the significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility 
the company s use of derivative instruments has the potential to expose the company to certain market risks including the possibility of the company s hedging activities not being as effective as anticipated in reducing the volatility of the company s cash flows  the counterparty not performing its obligations under the applicable hedging arrangement  the hedging arrangement being imperfect or ineffective  or the terms of the swap or associated debt may change 
the company seeks to lessen such risks by having established a policy to identify  control  and manage market risks which may arise from changes in interest rates  as well as limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company is exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from its foreign operations in canada  mexico and europe 
these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries  inter company loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in non functional currencies 
these risks may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on the company s financial results in the future 
in the normal course of business  foreign exchange risk is managed by using foreign currency forward contracts to hedge these exposures  as well as balance sheet netting of exposures 
the company s board of directors has approved a foreign exchange hedging policy to minimize foreign currency exposure 
the company s policy is to utilize financial instruments to reduce risks where internal netting cannot be effectively employed and not to enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company monitors its risk associated with the volatility of certain foreign currencies against its functional currencies and enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts to minimize short term currency risks on cash flows 
these positions are based upon our forecasted purchases and sales denominated in certain foreign currencies 
the company continually evaluates foreign exchange risk and may enter into foreign exchange transactions in accordance with its policy 
actual variances from these forecasted transactions can adversely impact foreign exchange results 
foreign currency gains and losses are included in other expense income 
the company has elected not to designate its foreign currency contracts as hedging instruments  and therefore  the instruments are marked to market with changes in their values recorded in the consolidated income statement each period 
the underlying exposures are denominated primarily in british pounds  euros  mexican pesos and canadian dollars 
at june   the fair value of the company s currency forward contracts outstanding was a net payable of less than million 
the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes
