item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents seasonality our operations are impacted by seasonal factors 
historically  our business has been negatively impacted during the winter months due to inclement weather  fewer daylight hours and holidays 
during the summer months  our operations may be impacted by tropical weather systems 
during periods of heavy snow  ice or rain  we may not be able to move our equipment between locations  thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenues 
in addition  the majority of our equipment works only during daylight hours 
in the winter months when days become shorter  this reduces the amount of time that our assets can work and therefore has a negative impact on total hours worked 
lastly  during the fourth quarter  we historically have experienced significant slowdown during the thanksgiving and christmas holiday seasons 
patents  trade secrets  trademarks and copyrights we own numerous patents  trademarks and proprietary technology that we believe provide us with a competitive advantage in the various markets in which we operate or intend to operate 
we have devoted significant resources to developing technological improvements in our well service business and have sought patent protection both inside and outside the united states for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance 
in the united states  as of december   we had patents issued and patents pending 
in foreign countries  as of december   we had patents issued and patents pending 
however  after evaluating the individual market opportunities and our international patent portfolio last year  we have determined not to maintain approximately two thirds of the currently active foreign pending patents applications 
all the issued patents have varying remaining durations and begin expiring between and the most notable of our technologies include numerous patents surrounding the keyview system 
we own several trademarks that are important to our business both in the united states and in foreign countries 
in general  depending upon the jurisdiction  trademarks are valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to become generic 
registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use 
while our patents and trademarks  in the aggregate  are of considerable importance to maintaining our competitive position  no single patent or trademark is considered to be of a critical or essential nature to our business 
we also rely on a combination of trade secret laws  copyright and contractual provisions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products and services 
we typically enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  strategic partners and suppliers and limit access to the distribution of our proprietary information 
employees as of january   we employed approximately  persons in our united states operations and approximately  additional persons in argentina  mexico and canada 
in addition  ooo geostream services group geostream  a company in the russian federation in which we own a controlling interest  employed together with its wholly owned subsidiaries approximately persons as of january  our domestic employees are not represented by a labor union and are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
many of our employees in argentina are represented by labor unions 
in mexico  we have entered into a collective bargaining agreement that applies to our workers in mexico performing work under the pemex contracts 
as noted below in item a 
risk factors  we have historically experienced a high employee turnover rate  and during the past several years have experienced labor related issues in argentina 
other than with respect to the labor situation in argentina  we have not experienced any significant work stoppages associated with labor disputes or grievances and consider our relations with our employees to be generally satisfactory 

table of contents governmental regulations our operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations pertaining to health  safety and the environment 
we cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws or regulations or how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings in the future 
we also cannot predict whether additional laws and regulations affecting our business will be adopted  or the effect such changes might have on us  our financial condition or our business 
the following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental  health and safety laws and regulations to which our operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
environmental regulations our operations routinely involve the storage  handling  transport and disposal of bulk waste materials  some of which contain oil  contaminants and other regulated substances 
various environmental laws and regulations require prevention  and where necessary  cleanup of spills and leaks of such materials  and some of our operations must obtain permits that limit the discharge of materials 
failure to comply with such environmental requirements or permits may result in fines and penalties  remediation orders and revocation of permits 
hazardous substances and waste the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as amended  referred to as cercla or the superfund law  and comparable state laws  impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain defined persons  including current and prior owners or operators of a site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
under cercla  these responsible persons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies 
in the course of our operations  we occasionally generate materials that are considered hazardous substances and  as a result  may incur cercla liability for cleanup costs 
also  claims may be filed for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants 
we also generate solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the resource conservation and recovery act  as amended  or rcra  and comparable state statutes 
although we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry  hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been released at properties owned or leased by us now or in the past  or at other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes were taken for treatment or disposal 
under cercla  rcra and analogous state laws  we could be required to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater  or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination 
air emissions the clean air act  as amended  or caa  and similar state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements 
these laws and regulations may require us to obtain approvals or permits for construction  modification or operation of certain projects or facilities and may require use of emission controls 
global warming and climate control some scientific studies suggest that emissions of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane may contribute to warming of the earth s atmosphere 
while we do not believe our operations raise climate control issues different from those generally raised by commercial use of fossil fuels  legislation or regulatory programs that restrict greenhouse gas emissions in areas where we conduct business could increase our costs in order to stay compliant with any new laws 
see item a 
risk factors 

table of contents water discharges we operate facilities that are subject to requirements of the clean water act  as amended  or cwa  and analogous state laws that impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters 
spill prevention  control and counter measure requirements under the cwa require implementation of measures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon spill 
other requirements for the prevention of spills are established under the oil pollution act of  as amended  or opa  which amends the cwa and applies to owners and operators of vessels  including barges  offshore platforms and certain onshore facilities 
under opa  regulated parties are strictly liable for oil spills and must establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such parties could be statutorily responsible 
occupational safety and health act we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act  as amended  or osha  and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety 
osha s hazard communication standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with osha requirements 
marine employees certain of our employees who perform services on our barge rigs or work offshore may be covered by the provisions of the jones act  the death on the high seas act  the longshore and harbor workers compensation act and general maritime law 
these laws operate to make the liability limits established under state workers compensation laws inapplicable to these employees 
instead  these employees or their representatives are permitted to pursue actions against us for damages resulting from job related injuries  generally with no limitations on our potential liability 
saltwater disposal wells we operate swd wells that are subject to the cwa  safe drinking water act  and state and local laws and regulations  including those established by the underground injection control program of the environmental protection agency epa  which establishes the minimum program requirements 
most of our swd wells are located in texas 
we also operate swd wells in arkansas  louisiana and new mexico 
regulations in these states require us to obtain a permit to operate each of our swd wells 
the applicable regulatory agency may suspend or modify one of our permits if our well operation is likely to result in pollution of freshwater  substantial violation of permit conditions or applicable rules  or if the well leaks into the environment 
wireline we conduct wireline logging  which may entail the use of radioactive isotopes along with other nuclear  electrical  acoustic and mechanical devices to evaluate downhole formation 
our activities involving the use of isotopes are regulated by the us nuclear regulatory commission and specified agencies of certain states 
additionally  we may use high explosive charges for perforating casing and formations  and various explosive cutters to assist in well bore cleanout 
such operations are regulated by the us department of justice bureau of alcohol  tobacco  firearms  and explosives and require us to obtain licenses or other approvals for the use of densitometers as well as explosive charges

item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered in evaluating us and our business 
business related risk factors our business is dependent on conditions in the oil and natural gas industry  especially oil and natural gas prices and capital expenditures by oil and natural gas companies 
volatility in oil and natural gas prices  tight credit markets and disruptions in the us and global financial systems may adversely impact our business 
prices for oil and natural gas historically have been extremely volatile and have reacted to changes in the supply of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
these include changes resulting from  among other things  the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to support oil prices  domestic and worldwide economic conditions and political instability in oil producing countries 
weakness in oil and natural gas prices or the perception by our customers that oil and natural gas prices will decrease in the future could result in a reduction in the utilization of our equipment and result in lower rates for our services 
in addition  when oil and natural gas prices are weak  or when our customers expect oil and natural gas prices to decrease  fewer wells are drilled  resulting in less completion and maintenance work for us 
additional factors that affect demand for our services include the level of development  exploration and production activity of  and corresponding capital spending by  oil and natural gas companies  oil and natural gas production costs  government regulations  and conditions in the worldwide oil and natural gas industry 
demand for our services is primarily influenced by current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices  and the significant decline in oil and natural gas prices beginning in the third quarter of caused our customers to reduce their spending on exploration and development drilling throughout this reduction in our customers spending could continue through and beyond 
further decline in demand for our oil and natural gas services could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
also impacting demand are the global economic conditions 
while appearing to have stabilized  the disruptions in the global credit markets during could continue to negatively impact the exploration and production expenditures by our customers throughout and beyond 
additionally  even as economic conditions appear to have begun to stabilize  it remains uncertain whether our customers  vendors and suppliers will be able to access financing necessary to return to their previous level of operations or to avoid further deceases in their level of operations  fulfill their commitments and fund future operations and obligations 
we may be unable to maintain pricing on our core services 
during the period from to  we periodically increased the prices on our services to offset rising costs and to generate higher returns for our stockholders 
however  as a result of pressures stemming from deteriorating market conditions and falling oil and natural gas prices beginning in the third quarter of and continuing through the first half of  it became increasingly difficult to maintain our prices 
we have and will likely continue to face pricing pressure from our competitors 
we have made price concessions  and may be compelled to make further price concessions  in order to maintain market share 

table of contents in addition  we expect our costs to rise if demand for our services increases with a recovering market  due in part to tighter labor markets and similar economic developments that would likely result from an improving market 
in addition to the recent difficulty we have experienced maintaining prices as described above  even if we are able to increase our prices as market conditions improve  we may not be able to do so at a rate that would be sufficient to cover such rising costs 
the inability to maintain our pricing  to increase our pricing as costs increase  or a reduction in our pricing  may have a continuing and material negative impact on our operating results in the future 
industry capacity may adversely affect our business 
between and  a significant amount of new capacity  including new well service rigs  new pressure pumping equipment and new fishing and rental equipment  entered the market 
in some cases  the new capacity was attributable to start up oilfield service companies and  in other cases  the new capacity was deployed by existing service providers to increase their service capacity 
the combination of overcapacity and declining demand exacerbated the pricing pressure for our services in although oilfield service companies are not likely to add significant new capacity under current market conditions  the overcapacity could cause us to experience continued pressure on the pricing of our services and experience lower utilization 
this could continue to have a material negative impact on our operating results 
our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairments or other charges 
we have recorded goodwill impairment charges and asset impairment charges in the past 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including our property and equipment  indefinite lived intangible assets  and goodwill for impairment 
in performing these assessments  we project future cash flows on a discounted basis for goodwill  and on an undiscounted basis for other long lived assets  and compare these cash flows to the carrying amount of the related assets 
these cash flow projections are based on our current operating plans  estimates and judgmental assumptions 
we perform the assessment of potential impairment on our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually  or more often if events and circumstances warrant 
we perform the assessment of potential impairment for our property and equipment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable due to various external or internal factors 
if we determine that our estimates of future cash flows were inaccurate or our actual results for are materially different than we have predicted  we could record additional impairment charges for interim periods during or in future years  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our business involves certain operating risks  which are primarily self insured  and our insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities we might incur in our operations 
our operations are subject to many hazards and risks  including the following accidents resulting in serious bodily injury and the loss of life or property  liabilities from accidents or damage by our fleet of trucks  rigs and other equipment  pollution and other damage to the environment  reservoir damage  blow outs  the uncontrolled flow of natural gas  oil or other well fluids into the atmosphere or an underground formation  and fires and explosions 
if any of these hazards occur  they could result in suspension of operations  damage to or destruction of our equipment and the property of others  or injury or death to our or a third party s personnel 
we self insure a significant portion of these liabilities 
for losses in excess of our self insurance limits  we maintain insurance from unaffiliated commercial carriers 
however  our insurance may not be adequate to 
table of contents cover all losses or liabilities that we might incur in our operations 
furthermore  our insurance may not adequately protect us against liability from all of the hazards of our business 
we also are subject to the risk that we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at a reasonable cost 
if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were uninsured or for which we were not fully insured  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to the economic  political and social instability risks of doing business in certain foreign countries 
we currently have operations in argentina  mexico and the russian federation  a technology development group based in canada  as well as investments in oilfield service companies based in canada 
in the future  we may expand our operations into other foreign countries as well 
as a result  we are exposed to risks of international operations  including increased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy in the markets where we operate  inflation and adverse economic conditions stemming from governmental attempts to reduce inflation  such as imposition of higher interest rates and wage and price controls  increased trade barriers  such as higher tariffs and taxes on imports of commodity products  exposure to foreign currency exchange rates  exchange controls or other currency restrictions  war  civil unrest or significant political instability  restrictions on repatriation of income or capital  expropriation  confiscatory taxation  nationalization or other government actions with respect to our assets located in the markets where we operate  governmental policies limiting investments by and returns to foreign investors  labor unrest and strikes  including the significant labor related issues we have experienced in argentina  deprivation of contract rights  and restrictive governmental regulation and bureaucratic delays 
the occurrence of one or more of these risks may negatively impact our results of operations  restrict the movement of funds and equipment to and from affected countries  and inhibit our ability to collect receivables 
we historically have experienced a high employee turnover rate 
any difficulty we experience replacing or adding workers could adversely affect our business 
we historically have experienced an annual employee turnover rate of almost 
we believe that the high turnover rate is attributable to the nature of the work  which is physically demanding and performed outdoors 
as a result  workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive with ours 
we cannot assure that at times of high demand we will be able to retain  recruit and train an adequate number of workers 
potential inability or lack of desire by workers to commute to our facilities and job sites and competition for workers from competitors or other industries are factors that could affect our ability to attract and retain workers 
we believe that our wage rates are competitive with the wage rates of our competitors and other potential employers 
a significant increase in the wages other employers pay could result in a reduction in our workforce  increases in our wage rates  or both 
either of these events could diminish our profitability and growth potential 

table of contents additionally  in response to the downturn in market conditions beginning in the second quarter of and continuing through the third quarter of  we made significant reductions in the size of our workforce 
excluding the reductions in workforce during in response to market conditions  our turnover rate in was 
as market conditions and our activity levels improve  we will be required to expand our workforce to accommodate these increases 
we may encounter difficulties in adding new headcount with the requisite experience levels  which could negatively impact our ability to take advantage of improving market conditions 
we may not be successful in implementing technology development and enhancements 
a component of our business strategy is to incorporate our technology into our well service rigs  primarily through the keyview system 
the inability to successfully develop and integrate the technology could limit our ability to improve our market position  increase our operating costs  and limit our ability to recoup the investments made in technology initiatives 
we may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental  health and safety laws and regulations that govern our operations 
our operations are subject to us federal  state and local  and foreign laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling  storage and disposal of waste materials  including toxic and hazardous wastes 
to comply with these laws and regulations  we must obtain and maintain numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various governmental authorities 
while the cost of such compliance has not been significant in the past  new laws  regulations or enforcement policies could become more stringent and significantly increase our compliance costs or limit our future business opportunities  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
failure to comply with environmental  health and safety laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative  civil or criminal penalties  imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens  revocation of permits  and  to a lesser extent  orders to limit or cease certain operations 
certain environmental laws impose strict and or joint and several liability  which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time of those actions 
for additional information  see the discussion under governmental regulations in item business 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain materials used in providing our pressure pumping services 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for sized sand  a principal raw material that is critical for our pressure pumping operations 
while the materials are generally available  if we were to have a problem sourcing raw materials or transporting these materials from these suppliers  our ability to provide pressure pumping services could be limited 
we may not be successful in identifying  making and integrating our acquisitions 
a component of our growth strategy is to make geographic focused acquisitions that will strengthen our presence in selected regional markets 
pursuit of this strategy may be restricted by the deterioration of credit markets  which may significantly limit the availability of funds for such acquisitions 
in addition to restricted funding availability  the success of this strategy will depend on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates and to negotiate acceptable financial and other terms 
there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
the success of an acquisition depends on our ability to perform adequate due diligence before the acquisition and on our ability to integrate the acquisition after it is completed 
while we commit significant resources to ensure that we conduct comprehensive due diligence  there can be no assurance that all potential risks and liabilities will be identified in connection with an acquisition 
similarly  while we expect to commit 
table of contents substantial resources  including management time and effort  to integrating acquired businesses into ours  there is no assurance that we will be successful integrating these businesses 
in particular  it is important that we be able to retain both key personnel of the acquired business and its customer base 
a loss of either key personnel or customers could negatively impact the future operating results of the acquired business 
the loss of a significant customer could cause our revenue to decline 
for the year ended december   one customer of our well servicing segment comprised approximately of our total consolidated revenues 
the work that we perform for this customer is done under contracts that expire in the near term and are subject to renewal through a bidding process 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to secure renewals of these contracts  and if we are unable to do so  the loss of this customer could have a material negative impact on our revenues and profitability 
compliance with climate change legislation or initiatives could negatively impact our business 
the us congress is considering legislation to mandate reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and certain states have already implemented  or are in the process of implementing  similar legislation 
additionally  the us supreme court has held in its decisions that carbon dioxide can be regulated as an air pollutant under the caa  which could result in future regulations even if the us congress does not adopt new legislation regarding emissions 
at this time  it is not possible to predict how legislation or new federal or state government mandates regarding the emission of greenhouse gases could impact our business  however  any such future laws or regulations could require us or our customers to devote potentially material amounts of capital or other resources in order to comply with such regulations 
these expenditures could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
debt related risk factors we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness  and to fund planned capital expenditures  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to conditions in the oil and gas industry  general economic and financial conditions  competition in the markets where we operate  the impact of legislative and regulatory actions on how we conduct our business and other factors  all of which are beyond our control 
this risk would be exacerbated by any economic downturn or instability in the us and global credit markets 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our outstanding indebtedness  or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other capital needs 
if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our outstanding indebtedness  we may have to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling assets  reducing or delaying acquisitions or capital investments  such as remanufacturing our rigs and related equipment  or seeking to raise additional capital 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to implement alternative financing plans  if necessary  on commercially reasonable terms or at all  or that implementing any such alternative financing plans would allow us to meet our debt obligations 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  or to obtain alternative financings  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects for growth 

table of contents in addition  a downgrade in our credit rating could become more likely if poor market conditions persist or worsen 
although such a credit downgrade would not have an effect on our currently outstanding senior debt under our indenture or senior secured credit facility  such a downgrade would make it more difficult for us to raise additional debt financing in the future 
the amount of our debt and the covenants in the agreements governing our debt could negatively impact our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
our level of indebtedness  and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt  could have important consequences for our operations  including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness and increasing the risk that we may default on our debt obligations  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital  capital expenditures and other general business activities  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate and other activities  limiting management s flexibility in operating our business  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  diminishing our ability to withstand successfully a downturn in our business or the economy generally  placing us at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors  and making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates  because certain debt will vary with prevailing interest rates 
we may be required to repay all or a portion of our debt on an accelerated basis in certain circumstances 
if we fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt  it could lead to an event of default and the consequent acceleration of our obligation to repay outstanding debt 
our ability to comply with debt covenants and other restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control  including general economic and financial conditions 
in particular  under the terms of our indebtedness  we must comply with certain financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests  several of which become more restrictive over time and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or take some other action in order to comply with them 
our ability to satisfy required financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions  and we cannot assure you that we will continue to meet those ratios and tests in the future 
a breach of any of these covenants  ratios or tests could result in a default under our indebtedness 
if we default  our credit facility lenders will no longer be obligated to extend credit to us and they  as well as the trustee for our outstanding notes  could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the indenture or senior secured credit facility  as applicable  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
the results of such actions would have a significant negative impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 
borrowings under our senior secured credit facility bear interest at variable rates  exposing us to interest rate risk 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same  and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness would decrease 

table of contents takeover protection related risks our bylaws contain provisions that may prevent or delay a change in control 
our amended and restated bylaws contain certain provisions designed to enhance the ability of the board of directors to respond to unsolicited attempts to acquire control of the company 
these provisions establish a classified board of directors  providing for three year staggered terms of office for all members of our board of directors  set limitations on the removal of directors  provide our board of directors the ability to set the number of directors and to fill vacancies on the board of directors occurring between stockholder meetings  and set limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders 
these provisions may have the effect of entrenching management and may deprive investors of the opportunity to sell their shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices 
this potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock
