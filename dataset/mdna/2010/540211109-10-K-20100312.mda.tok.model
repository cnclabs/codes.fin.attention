item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere herein 
executive overview despite the challenging economic conditions affecting the travel and lodging industry  during we proactively managed our business and operations  which resulted in improvements to our bottom line and free cash flow performance 
we define free cash flow  a non gaap measure  as cash provided by operating activities less cash used for certain investing activities  including growth related capital  and consideration paid for acquisitions 
our diversified revenue initiatives  which focus on non guest entertainment revenue  increased million or  year over year 
our system operations and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  a decrease of or million over  and helped offset of total gross profit decline in our income from operations increased million  from an operating loss of million in to an operating income of million in additionally  we proactively reduced our capital investment activity in by  down to million compared to million in  increasing our free cash flow by during to million 
these operational results  along with proceeds from our preferred stock offering  allowed us to reduce our long term debt by million during and to be in compliance with the terms of our credit facility 
we plan to continue to utilize a majority of our free cash flow for further debt reduction  and expect to remain in compliance with our credit facility during we remain focused on improving our profitability and maximizing cash flow through ongoing operations 
as a result of the economic conditions  record low occupancy levels of the hotel industry and the demand for our products and services during  our total revenue was million  a decrease of million or  compared to the decrease in revenue was attributed to a decrease in guest entertainment revenue  partially offset by increases in revenue from hotel services  system sales and related services and healthcare 
hospitality revenue  which includes guest entertainment  hotel services and system sales and related services  decreased million or  to million for compared to million for due to softness in the travel economy  hotel occupancy declined during compared to last year 
the average monthly hospitality revenue per room was for  a decrease of as compared to for guest entertainment revenue  which includes on demand entertainment such as movies  games  music and other interactive services delivered through the television  decreased million or  to million 
on a per room basis  monthly guest entertainment revenue for declined  to compared to in average monthly movie revenue per room was for  a reduction as compared to per room in the prior year 
these decreases were the result of the decline in occupancy and a cautious consumer buying pattern 
partially offsetting the decline in guest entertainment revenue was an increase to hotel services revenue  which includes revenue paid by hotels for television programming and broadband internet service and support 
hotel services revenue increased million or  to million for versus million for on a per room basis  monthly hotel services revenue for increased  to compared to in monthly television programming revenue per room was for  an increase as compared to per room in the prior year 
these increases resulted primarily from the continued installation of high definition television systems and related television programming services 
recurring broadband internet revenue per room was for compared to for the prior year 
system sales and related services  which includes the sale of television programming reception equipment  broadband internet equipment and other hdtv equipment and installation services to hotels  increased million or  to million for as compared to million for during the year  we completed a large hdtv equipment conversion contract  which contributed to approximately million of the increase 
the remainder of the growth was derived from sales of equipment and professional services to hotels  offset by a decline in broadband equipment sales 

table of contents other revenue  including the sale of interactive systems and services to healthcare facilities as well as revenue from advertising and media services  increased million or  to million for compared to million in for  healthcare revenue increased by million  while advertising and media services revenue decreased by million  due to softness in the economy and the general advertising market 
total direct costs exclusive of operating expenses and depreciation and amortization discussed separately below were million in  a decrease of million or  as compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to decreased commissions and royalties of million  which vary with revenue  and a reduction in recurring connectivity and other internet support costs of million  as a result of our cost reduction initiatives 
partially offsetting the reductions were increases to television programming costs of million  which varies with related revenue and the number of rooms served  along with the type of services provided 
system and equipment cost of sales was up million  and also varies with increased revenue 
total direct costs as a percentage of revenue were in as compared to for the increase in direct costs as a percentage of revenue was driven by a change in the mix of products or services sold year over year  primarily driven by an increase in revenue generated by television programming and system sales  which generally have a lower margin than guest entertainment revenues 
system operations expenses and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in compared to million in per average installed room  system operations expenses also decreased  to per room per month for compared to for sg a expenses per average installed room were in compared to per average installed room in these decreases resulted from the synergies derived from the consolidation of duplicative service operations  general and administrative functions from the on command and stayonline acquisitions  our labor expense reduction initiatives implemented during and  and certain lower operating expenses  including system repair  property taxes  due to a lower taxable asset base and fuel costs 
despite the revenue decline  we generated million of cash from operating activities during  as compared to million in cash used for property and equipment additions  including growth related capital  was million 
during the year  we also used the cash generated from operations to pay the required term b principal repayments of million and made million of additional payments against the term b portion of the credit facility 
hospitality business guest entertainment includes purchases for on demand movies  network based video games  music and music videos and television on demand programming 
our primary source of revenue is providing in room  interactive guest entertainment  for which the hotel guest pays on a per view  hourly or daily basis 
our total guest generated revenue depends on a number of factors  including the number of rooms on our network 
we can increase revenue over time by increasing the number of rooms served by our interactive television systems 
our ability to expand our room base is dependent on a number of factors  including newly constructed hotel properties and the attractiveness of our technology  service and support to hotels currently operating without an interactive television system 
the occupancy rate at the property 
our revenue also varies depending on hotel occupancy rates  which are subject to a number of factors  including seasonality  general economic conditions and world events  such as terrorist threats or public health issues 
occupancy rates for the properties we serve are typically higher during the second and third quarters due to seasonal travel patterns 
we target higher occupancy properties in diverse demographic and geographic locations in an effort to mitigate occupancy related risks 
the popularity  timeliness and amount of content offered at the hotel 
our revenues vary  to a certain degree  with the number  timeliness and popularity of movie content available for viewing  and whether the content is presented in digital or analog format 
historically  a decrease in the availability of popular movie content has adversely impacted revenue  and the availability of high definition content has increased revenue 
although not completely within our control  we seek to program and promote the most popular available movie content and other content to maximize revenue and profitability 

table of contents the price of the service purchased by the hotel guest 
generally  we control the prices charged for our products and services and manage pricing in an effort to maximize revenue and overall profitability 
we establish pricing based on such things as the demographics of the property served  the popularity of the content and overall general economic conditions 
our technology enables us to measure the popularity of our content and make decisions to best position such content and optimize revenue from such content 
the availability of alternative programming 
we compete directly for customers with a variety of other interactive service providers  including other interactive television service providers  cable television companies  direct broadcast satellite companies  television networks and programmers  internet service providers and portals  technology consulting and service firms  companies offering web sites which provide on demand movies  rental companies providing dvds which can be viewed in properly equipped hotel rooms or on other portable viewing devices and hotels which offer in room laptops with internet access or other types of internet access systems 
we also compete  in varying degrees  with other leisure time activities such as movie theaters  the internet  radio  print media  personal computers and other alternative sources of entertainment and information 
consumer sentiment 
the willingness of guests to purchase our entertainment services is also impacted by the general economic environment and its impact on consumer sentiment 
historically  such impacts were not generally material to our revenue results  however  during and the last half of  the deteriorating economic conditions did have a significant  negative impact on our revenue levels 
as economic conditions improve in the future  guest purchase activity may or may not increase to the same levels previously experienced by the company 
the primary direct costs of providing guest entertainment are license fees paid to major motion picture studios  which are variable and based on a percent of guest generated revenue  for non exclusive distribution rights of recently released major motion pictures  commissions paid to our hotel customers  which are also variable and based on a percent of guest generated revenue  license fees  which are based on a percent of guest generated revenue  for television on demand  music  music videos  video games and sports programming  and one time license fees paid for independent films  most of which are non rated and intended for mature audiences 
hotel services includes revenue from hotels for services such as television channels and recurring broadband internet service and support to the hotels 
another major source of our revenue is providing cable television programming and internet services to the lodging industry  for which the hotel pays a fixed monthly fee 
television programming 
we offer a wide variety of satellite delivered television programming paid for by the hotel and provided to guests at no charge 
the television programming is delivered via satellite  pursuant to an agreement with directv  and is distributed over the internal hotel network  and typically includes premium channels such as hbo and showtime  which broadcast major motion pictures and specialty programming  as well as non premium channels  such as cnn and espn 
with the launch of the high definition configuration of our interactive television system  we also began offering high definition television programming to the extent available from broadcast sources and directv 
broadband internet access  service and support 
we also design  install and operate wired and wireless broadband internet access systems at hotel properties 
these systems control access to the internet  provide bandwidth management tools and allow hotels to charge or provide the access as a guest amenity 
post installation  we generate recurring revenue through the ongoing maintenance  service and call center support services to hotel properties installed by us and also to hotel properties installed by other providers 
while this is a highly competitive area  we believe we have important advantages as a result of our pro active monitoring interface with hotel systems to improve up time  existing hotel customer relationships and our nationwide field service network 

table of contents system sales and related services 
we also generate revenue from other products and services within the hotel and lodging industry  including sales of internet access equipment  other interactive television systems and equipment  television programming reception equipment  internet conference services and professional services  such as design  project management and installation services 
key metrics rooms served one of the metrics we monitor within our hospitality business is the number of rooms we serve for our various services 
as of december  we had the following number of rooms installed with the designated service total rooms served total guest entertainment rooms total hd rooms percent of total guest entertainment rooms total television programming ftg rooms percent of total guest entertainment rooms total broadband internet rooms percent of total rooms served total rooms served include rooms receiving one or more of our services  including rooms served by international licensees 
guest entertainment rooms  of which are digital  receive one or more guest entertainment services  such as movies  video games  music or other interactive services 
hd rooms are equipped with high definition capabilities 
television programming ftg rooms receive basic or premium television programming 
represents rooms receiving high speed internet service 
high definition room growth we also track the increasing penetration of our high definition television hdtv system  since rooms equipped with hdtv services typically generate higher revenue  in a stable economic environment  from guest entertainment and hotel services than rooms equipped with our other vod systems 
hdtv room growth is occurring as we install our hdtv system in newly contracted rooms and convert select rooms to the hdtv system in exchange for long term contract extensions 
we installed our systems in the following number of net new rooms and had the following total rooms installed as of december net new hdtv rooms total hdtv rooms installed hdtv rooms as a percent of total guest entertainment rooms hdtv rooms  including new installations and major upgrades  are equipped with high definition capabilities 

table of contents capital investment per installed room the average investment per room associated with an installation can fluctuate due to the type of interactive television system installed  engineering efforts  component costs  product segmentation  cost of assembly and installation  average property size  certain fixed costs and hotel capital contributions 
the following table sets forth our average installation and conversion investment cost per room on a comparable room base during the years ended december average cost per room new installation average cost per room conversion average cost per hd room new installation average cost per hd room conversion the decrease in the average cost per new and converted hd rooms from to was primarily driven by larger average room sizes for properties installed  lower component and overhead costs  engineering efforts and hotels contributing a greater share of total installation costs through purchases of systems and equipment 
average revenue per room we monitor the revenue we generate per average hospitality room 
guest entertainment revenue can fluctuate based on several factors  including occupancy  consumer sentiment  mix of travelers  the availability of high definition and alternative programming  the popularity of movie content  the mix of services purchased and the overall economic environment 
during  occupancy rates were lower than levels 
hotel services revenue can fluctuate based on the percentage of our hotels purchasing cable television programming services from us  the type of services provided at each site  as well as the number of hotels purchasing broadband service and support from us 
system sales and related services revenue can fluctuate based on the number of system and equipment sales  including broadband systems sales 
the following table sets forth the components of our hospitality revenue per room for the years ended december average monthly revenue per room hospitality guest entertainment hotel services system sales and related services total hospitality revenue per room certain contracts within our acquired on command customer base included substantial discounts for satellite delivered basic and premium television programming  which negatively impacted hotel services revenue 
we expect to eliminate these discounts as we continue to upgrade with high definition television capabilities 

table of contents direct costs guest entertainment direct costs vary based on content license fees  the mix of guest entertainment products purchased and the commission earned by the hotel 
hotel services direct costs include the cost of cable television programming and the cost of broadband internet support services 
the cost of system sales and related services primarily includes the cost of the systems and equipment sold to hotels 
the overall direct cost margin primarily varies based on the composition of revenue 
the following table sets forth our hospitality direct expenses per room and as a percentage of related revenue during the years ended december percent percent percent of related of related of related amount revenue amount revenue amount revenue direct costs per room hospitality guest entertainment hotel services system sales and related services total hospitality direct costs per room the decrease in the average direct cost per guest entertainment room varies with revenue and was driven by lower commissions earned by the hotels and offset by a change in the mix of movie products purchased 
other businesses other revenue is a combination of our advertising and healthcare businesses 
we deliver advertising supported media into select hotel segments  from which we earn revenue from the sale of television commercials or other marketing based programs 
the demographic and professional profile of the traveler within our room base tends to have characteristics we believe may be attractive to consumer marketing organizations 
by approaching guests with relevant messaging when they are in the comfort of a hotel room  free of distractions  advertisers have a prime opportunity to capture the attention of and connect with these desired consumers 
in addition to market demands  our revenue is also dependent on rooms available to promote customer products and services 
as of december   we provide advertising media services to over million hotel rooms compared to million rooms in we also deliver targeted advertising to more than  hotel rooms on popular satellite delivered channels 
the healthcare market in the united states consists of approximately  hospital beds across  facilities 
we believe most hospitals currently do not have any form of interactive television services 
the main interests in interactive television services include driving patient satisfaction  providing robust patient education with comprehensive reporting and operation efficiencies and cost savings for automating processes such as integrated food ordering 
our healthcare revenue is generated through a variety of services and solutions provided to care facilities  including revenue generated from the sale of the interactive system hardware  software license and installation services  revenue from the sale and installation of directv satellite equipment and related programming  revenue from recurring support agreements for interactive content  software maintenance and technical field service support  including service agreements covering cable plant  directv satellite equipment and interactive systems  and revenue generated from cable plant design  modification and installation  as well as television installation services 
as of december   we have equipped healthcare facilities  or  beds  with these services and solutions to improve the overall patient experience  as compared to properties or  rooms as of december

system operations expenses consist of costs directly related to the operation and maintenance of systems at hotel sites 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a primarily include payroll costs  stock based compensation  engineering development costs and legal  marketing  professional and compliance costs

special note regarding the use of non gaap financial information to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  we use free cash flow  a non gaap measure derived from results based on gaap 
the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered superior to  in isolation of  or as a substitute for  results prepared in accordance with gaap 
we define free cash flow  a non gaap measure  as cash provided by operating activities less cash used for certain investing activities  including growth related capital  and consideration paid for acquisitions 
free cash flow is a key liquidity measure but should not be construed as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of our profitability or performance 
we provide information about free cash flow because we believe it is a useful way for us  and our investors  to measure our ability to satisfy cash needs  including interest payments on our debt  taxes and capital expenditures 
gaap requires us to provide information about cash flow generated from operations 
our definition of free cash flow does not take into account our debt service requirements or other commitments 
accordingly  free cash flow is not necessarily indicative of amounts of cash which may be available to us for discretionary purposes 
our method of computing free cash flow may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

table of contents free cash flow one of our goals is to increase the level of free cash flow we generate 
we manage our free cash flow by seeking to maximize the amount of cash we generate from our operations and managing the level of our investment activity 
during  we allocated a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of debt and used the balance of the cash flow for capital expenditures 
we can manage capital expenditures by reducing the per room installation cost of a room and by varying the number of rooms we install in any given period 
levels of free cash flow are set forth in the following table dollar amounts in thousands cash provided by operating activities property and equipment additions cash used for acquisitions and other activities cash provided by operating activities include acquisitions and integration of on command  thn and stayonline

table of contents in june  we entered into a purchase agreement to sell  shares of our series b cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock  par value per share  with a liquidation preference of  per share 
the initial purchaser was also granted a day option to purchase up to an additional  shares of the preferred stock to cover overallotments 
we completed our offering of  shares inclusive of the initial purchaser s option to purchase the additional  shares  bringing the total aggregate liquidation preference of the preferred stock sold to million 
net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock were million  with offering and related costs totaling million 
we were required to use of the proceeds  or million  to pay down our credit facility 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash from operations  our cash on hand and the million revolver portion of our credit facility  which matures in we believe our cash on hand  operating cash flow and borrowing available under the credit facility will be sufficient to fund our business and comply with our financing obligations 
during  we plan to continue to allocate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of debt and use the balance of the cash flow for capital expenditures 
as of december   working capital was million  compared to million at december  the collectability of our receivables is reasonably assured  as supported by our broad customer base 
our interactive hotel base is well diversified in terms of i location  ii demographics  and iii customer contracts 
we provide our services to various hotel chains  ownership groups and management companies 
in accordance with our hotel contracts  monies collected by the hotel for interactive television services are held in trust on our behalf  thereby limiting our risk from hotel bankruptcies 
in order to fund our acquisitions of on command and stayonline  in april we entered into a million bank credit facility  comprised of a million term loan  which matures in april  and a million revolving credit facility  which matures in april the term loan originally required quarterly repayments of million  which began september  the required quarterly payments have been adjusted for the reduction in principal as a result of our early repayments against the loan 
for the fourth quarter of  the adjusted quarterly payment requirement was million 
the term loan bears interest at our option of the bank s base rate plus a margin of or libor plus a margin of 
the agreement provides that when our consolidated leverage ratio is below times  the term loan bears interest at our option of the bank s base rate plus a margin of or libor plus a margin of 
the term loan is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the credit facility includes terms and conditions which require compliance with leverage and interest coverage covenants 
the credit facility also stipulates we enter into hedge agreements to provide at least of the outstanding term loan into a fixed interest rate for a period not less than two years 
we have entered into fixed rate swap agreements for million or of the outstanding term loan  with fixed interest rates ranging from to see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the term loan interest rate as of december  was 
the aggregate weighted average interest rate as of december  was  which includes the term loan and lease interest rates and the difference in the swaps fixed interest rate versus libor 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants required of our bank credit facility 

table of contents our leverage and interest coverage ratios were as follows for the years ended december actual consolidated leverage ratio maximum per covenant actual consolidated interest coverage ratio minimum per covenant our maximum consolidated leverage ratio is the total amount of all indebtedness of the company  determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with gaap  divided by operating income exclusive of depreciation and amortization and adjusted plus or minus for certain other miscellaneous cash items  non cash items and non recurring items  as defined by the terms of the bank credit facility 
our minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio is a function of operating income exclusive of depreciation and amortization and adjusted plus or minus for certain other miscellaneous cash items  non cash items and non recurring items divided by interest expense  as defined by the terms of the bank credit facility 
maximum consolidated leverage ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratios are defined terms of the bank credit facility and are presented here to demonstrate compliance with the covenants in our credit facility  as noncompliance with such covenants could have a material adverse effect on us 
we do not utilize special purpose entities or off balance sheet financial arrangements 
our debt covenant ratios will change in future periods as follows q q to maturity maximum consolidated leverage ratio minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio 
table of contents in order to continue operating efficiently and expand our business  we must remain in compliance with covenants outlined in our credit facility 
our ability to remain in compliance with those covenants will depend on our ability to generate sufficient adjusted operating cash flow as defined in the credit facility and cash from operations  to manage our level of capital investment and to continue to reduce our debt 
we continue taking actions within our control to reduce our debt and remain in compliance with our debt covenants 
the actions within our control include our prudent management of capital investment and operating costs and exploring other alternatives  which may include seeking an amendment to our credit facility  raising additional capital  wage reductions  reduced service hours or other reductions to the workforce 
in june  we completed a preferred stock offering  with net proceeds of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe we are balancing the interest of our customers and our company by reducing our capital investments  reducing our operating cost structure and aggressively reducing the level of debt 
we achieved a consolidated leverage ratio of compared to the maximum allowable of for the fourth quarter of our ability to continue to comply with these covenants is subject to the general economic climate and business conditions beyond our control 
during  as part of our debt reduction initiative  we acquired  through a wholly owned subsidiary as a permitted investment under our credit facility  million of outstanding debt at of par value and recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
under our credit facility  we can make permitted investments  as defined by the credit facility  of up to million 
we are committed to reducing our debt and are taking actions to remain in compliance with our debt covenants 
though we expect to comply with all debt covenants during  our ability to comply with these covenants depends on achieving our planned operating results and making further debt reductions 
given the continuing softness in the economy and the uncertainties impacting travel and lodging  in addition to the constraints in the credit markets  consumer conservatism and other market dynamics  we cannot assure we will be able to meet our planned results and required covenants 
if we are not able to remain in compliance with the debt covenants  it will likely have a significant  unfavorable impact on our business and financial condition and we may need to amend the credit facility to seek a waiver of the covenants 
an amendment to the credit facility may significantly increase our interest costs  add upfront fees or modify other terms less favorable to us than we currently have in our credit facility 
in the event our lenders will not amend or waive the covenants  the debt would be due and we would need to seek alternative financing 
we cannot provide assurance we would be able to obtain alternative financing 
if we were not able to secure alternative financing  this would have a substantial adverse impact on the company 
the credit facility also requires we notify the agent upon the occurrence of a material adverse effect prior to any draw on the company s revolving credit facility  as such terms are defined and used within our bank credit facility 
however  under the credit facility  the provision of such a notice is not an event of default  but if such an event occurred  it could restrict the company s ability to obtain additional financing under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   we are not aware of any events which would qualify as a material adverse effect under the credit facility 
the total amount of long term debt outstanding  including the current portion  as of december  was million versus million as of december  in april  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with notional values of million  at a fixed rate of  and million  at a fixed rate of  both of which expire in june these swap arrangements effectively change the underlying debt from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate for the term of the swap agreements 
the swap agreements were designated as  and met the criteria for  cash flow hedges and are not considered speculative in nature 
all of the swap agreements have been issued by credit suisse international 
the credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to million  subject to customary terms and conditions

consists of open purchase orders and commitments  primarily for the procurement of system components 
in connection with our programming related agreements  we may guarantee minimum royalties for specific periods or by individual programming content 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the second quarter of  an amendment was made to our non exclusive license agreement with nintendo  which expires in may under the original terms of the agreement  we paid a monthly royalty equal to a percent of revenue generated from the sale of nintendo video game services  subject to a monthly minimum 
under the amended terms  effective april   the royalty amount is strictly a percent of revenue and the monthly minimum royalty obligation has been eliminated 
seasonality our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation  depending upon hotel occupancy rates and other factors  including travel patterns and the economy 
our hotel customers typically experience higher occupancy rates during the second and third quarters  due to seasonal travel patterns and  accordingly  we historically have higher revenue and cash flow in those quarters 
however  quarterly revenue can be affected by the availability of popular content during those quarters and by consumer purchasing behavior 
we have no control over when new content is released or how popular it will be  or the effect of economic conditions on consumer behavior 

table of contents market conditions due to current economic conditions  our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the lodging industry s performance 
our results are closely linked to the performance of the lodging industry  where occupancy rates may fluctuate resulting from various factors 
the percentage of occupied rooms that buy movies and other services at the property also varies over time with general economic conditions  including  but not limited to  consumer sentiment  and other factors 
reduction in hotel occupancy  resulting from the general economic environment or other changes in market conditions  such as a recession or significant slow down in economic activity  or significant international crises  could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the overall travel industry can be  and has been in the past  adversely affected by weaker general economic climates  geopolitical instability and concerns about public health 
factors such as the cost of fuel  airline fares  and other economic conditions which result in a decrease in business or leisure travel can affect hotel occupancy and the demand for some of our products and services 
also  our goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired if market conditions deteriorate 
other market risk factors are included in part i  item a risk factors

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our primary cost drivers are predetermined rates  such as hotel commissions  license fees paid for major motion pictures and other content or one time fixed fees for independent films and television programming costs 
however  the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable based upon the available information 
the critical policies related to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements are further discussed within the notes of the financial statements as follows revenue recognition footnote goodwill and other intangible assets footnote restructuring footnote recent accounting developments in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb accounting standard update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which is now codified under fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue recognition 
this asu establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method  and requires a vendor determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner consistent with that used to determine the selling price of the deliverable on a standalone basis 
the asu also significantly expands the required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
fasb asu no 
is effective on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we are evaluating the effect from the adoption of this asu on our current and future business models 
depending on how we sell and deliver future systems and services  this asu could have an effect on the timing of revenue recognition and our consolidated results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued fasb asu no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  which is now codified under fasb asc topic  software 
this asu changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements which include both tangible products and software elements  providing guidance on how to determine which software  if any  relating to the tangible product would be excluded from the scope of the software revenue guidance 
fasb asu no

in january  the fasb issued fasb asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which is now codified under fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
this asu will require additional disclosures regarding transfers in and out of levels and of the fair value hierarchy  as well as a reconciliation of activity in level on a gross basis rather than as one net number 
the asu also provides clarification on disclosures about the level of disaggregation for each class of assets and liabilities and on disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
fasb asu no 
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures requiring a reconciliation of activity in level those disclosures will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this asu will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including potential losses resulting from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest 
at december   we had debt totaling million  with a weighted average interest rate as follows dollar amounts in thousands carrying fair weighted average amount value interest rate bank credit facility bank term loan capital leases the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on current interest rates for similar debt of the same remaining maturities and quoted market prices  except for capital leases  which are reported at carrying value 
for our capital leases  the carrying value approximates the fair value 
in addition  the fair value of our long term debt is strictly hypothetical and not indicative of what we are required to pay under the terms of our debt instruments 
we have two interest rate swap agreements  with notional values of million  at a fixed rate of  and million  at a fixed rate of  both of which expire in june our aggregate weighted average interest rate  which includes the term loan and lease interest rates and the difference in the swaps fixed interest rate versus libor  for the year ended december   was  compared to for the year ended december  after giving effect to the interest rate swap arrangements  we had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million at december  for fixed rate debt  interest rate fluctuations affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows  if effective 
conversely  for variable rate debt  interest rate fluctuations generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
the impact on earnings and cash flow for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase to interest rates would be approximately  assuming other variables remain constant 
economic condition 
our results are closely connected to the performance of the lodging industry  where occupancy rates may fluctuate resulting from various factors 
reduction in hotel occupancy resulting from business  general economic  or other events  such as a recession in the united states  significant international crises  acts of terrorism  war or public health issues  could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the overall travel industry can be  and has been in the past  adversely affected by weaker general economic climates  geopolitical instability and concerns about public health 
foreign currency transactions 
a portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of guest entertainment services in canada and mexico 
the results of operations and financial position of our operations in canada and mexico are measured in their local currencies and translated into us dollars 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations in canada and mexico are somewhat mitigated by the fact expenses and liabilities are generally incurred in the local currency 
the reported income of our canadian and mexican subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the local currency 
additionally  a portion of our assets are based in canada and mexico and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period 
accordingly  our consolidated assets will fluctuate depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the local currency
