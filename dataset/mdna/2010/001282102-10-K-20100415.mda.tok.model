depreciation expense decreased  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the same period in this decrease is primarily due to lower depreciable assets in service due to disposals and impairments 
accounting guidance related to goodwill requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using the two step method at least annually or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the company measures the fair value of its reporting units annually on december the goodwill impairment test initially consists of the comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
for the company  a reporting unit consists of the newspaper operations in each geographic area 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of december  and december  and based on the results  recognized no additional impairment in and recognized impairment charges to write off the remaining goodwill attributable to the press enterprise of  in in  the company recognized impairment charges to goodwill attributable to the providence journal of  and the press enterprise of  the impairment charges resulted primarily from a decline in the estimated fair value of the individual businesses due to lower than estimated market growth rates and margins versus prior year estimates

as a result  no interest expense for these notes was accrued after february  interest expense decreased  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in interest paid to belo corp  resulting from the elimination of debt to belo in connection with the distribution  was partially offset by interest expense of approximately related to the company s credit facility entered into subsequent to february  other expense income  net  increased  or percent  in when compared to this is primarily due to the decision made by the company to write off investments and or loans previously made in startup companies 
the company had invested or loaned approximately  for non controlling ownership interests in these startup companies 
as part of the company s periodic review of its investments  the company made the decision that these previously invested amounts were permanently impaired and no longer had value 
this decision that the investments or loans were impaired was made due to the ongoing lack of success of the companies 
these write offs were partially offset by a sales tax refund and the gain on the sale of a subsidiary 
other expense income  net  decreased  or percent  in when compared to this is primarily due to a gain recognized on the disposal of land and a building in dallas  texas in that was not used in the ordinary course of business 
income tax benefit decreased  in when compared to this decrease in tax benefit was primarily attributable to lower taxable loss and adjustments made for the valuation allowance 
the effective tax rates for   and were percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
as of december   the company incurred prior year losses and projected current year federal and state net operating losses of  these net operating losses can be carried back to prior taxable years and carried forward to offset future taxable income 
these losses will begin to expire in the years and if not utilized 
in accordance with the amended tax matters agreement  the company may enter into an agreement with belo to file a claim to carry back a portion of these losses and recoup prior taxes paid 
applicable accounting guidance related to income taxes places a threshold for recognition of deferred tax assets based on whether it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
in making this determination  the company considers all positive and negative evidence  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  tax planning strategies and recent financial results 
based on the criteria established in the accounting guidance  the company established a valuation allowance in as it is more likely than not a portion of the benefits derived from certain deferred tax assets may not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
at december  and  the company had deferred tax assets of  and  respectively 
these deferred tax assets were partially offset by valuation allowances of  and  respectively  and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of  and  respectively 
the establishment of the valuation allowance is primarily due to the company s determination that some of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
the company will continue to evaluate the ability to realize its deferred tax assets in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance and will adjust the amount of such allowance if necessary 
the amended tax matters agreement between belo and the company addresses the carry back of tax losses 
after the tax matters agreement was amended  belo amended the previously filed consolidated tax return to generate an  federal income tax refund 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  belo and the company agreed that the refund will be held by belo on the company s behalf and applied towards the company s future obligations to reimburse belo for a portion of its contributions to the belo sponsored pension plan

revenue recognition 
newspaper advertising revenue is recorded  net of agency commissions  when the advertisements are published in the newspaper

proceeds from subscriptions are deferred and are included in revenue on a pro rata basis over the term of the subscriptions 
subscription revenues under buy sell arrangements with distributors are recorded based on the net amount received from the distributor  whereas subscription revenues under fee based delivery arrangements with distributors are recorded based on the amount received from the subscriber 
commercial printing revenue is recorded when the product is shipped 
impairment of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets 
the company s intangible assets and goodwill result from its significant business acquisitions  which occurred prior to in connection with these acquisitions  the company obtained appraisals of the significant assets purchased 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired was recorded as goodwill

table of contents as required by applicable accounting guidance  the company assesses goodwill annually at year end or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the required two step approach uses accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results 
changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
the company performs the impairment testing at its three newspaper operating units 
an impairment loss generally is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimates and judgments that most significantly affect the fair value calculation are assumptions related to revenue growth  newsprint prices  compensation levels  discount rate and private and public market trading multiples for newspaper assets 
see consolidated financial statements  note goodwill and intangible assets  for a discussion of the impairment charges taken 
during the three months ended march   primarily based upon the continued declining economic environment which resulted in a larger than anticipated decline in advertising demand during the first quarter of and potentially the remainder of the year  the company determined that sufficient evidence existed to require it to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis 
during the first quarter of  the company performed the first step of its interim goodwill impairment test for both the dallas morning news and the providence journal 
the company uses the discounted cash flows method to determine fair value of its operating units 
the use of discounted cash flows is based on assumptions requiring significant judgment regarding revenue growth rates  margins  discount factors and tax rates 
the assumptions used in the step one analysis were consistent with the company s then current estimates and projections  some of which differ from the assumptions used for the annual impairment testing in december the change in assumptions was driven by greater than anticipated declines in revenue in the first quarter of  which resulted in lower margins despite significant cost reductions 
the step one analysis results indicated a potential goodwill impairment existed at the providence journal  but not at the dallas morning news 
while the step one analysis for both reporting units reflected significant declines in forecasted advertising revenue based on the results from the first three months of  when the analysis was performed  the dallas morning news expected to continue to produce sufficient margins such that the carrying amount of its goodwill was not impaired 
in performing the step one analysis for the dallas morning news  management also considered the sensitivity of its assumptions to additional risk and concluded that the step one analysis would continue to not indicate impairment with more conservative inputs 
however  due to the relative size of the carrying amount and estimated fair value of the providence journal  its margins were impacted such that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value 
therefore  the company performed the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis  which involves calculating the implied impairment of goodwill for the providence journal 
the second step involved allocating the estimated fair value of the operating unit to all of its assets and liabilities  except goodwill  and comparing the residual fair value to the carrying amount of goodwill of the providence journal 
during the first quarter of  the company determined the goodwill related to the providence journal was impaired and recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of  after recording the impairment charge  no goodwill remained related to the providence journal 
at december   the company performed it annual goodwill impairment testing and determined there was no additional goodwill impairment 
as a result of the annual goodwill assessment performed as of december   the company incurred a non cash charge to goodwill of approximately  in the fourth quarter of related to impairment at the press enterprise 
as a result of the annual goodwill assessment performed as of december   the company incurred a non cash charge to goodwill of approximately  in the fourth quarter of related to goodwill impairment at two of the company s reporting units the providence journal and the press enterprise 
there is no tax effect related to these impairment charges  and these non cash charges will not affect the company s liquidity  cash flows from operating activities  debt covenants  or have any effect on future operations 
the company reviews the carrying value of property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property and equipment is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to the future net cash flows the property and equipment is expected to generate 
during the three months ended september   in an additional step to reduce its cost structure  the dallas morning news elected to consolidate its production facilities and is in the process of relocating production equipment from the south plant to its north plant where the newspapers are printed 
the south plant was built in and is utilized by the dallas morning news for the collating and assembly of the preprint packages included in the sunday paper 
the company  with the assistance of a third party  estimated the market value of the south plant based on market information for comparable properties in the dallas fort worth area 
the estimated market value was compared to carrying value and  as a result  the company recorded  of impairment expense to align the carrying value with estimated market value  less selling costs

the company re evaluated the facts and circumstances and accounting literature related to this contractual obligation and as a result  concluded it incorrectly accounted for the contractual obligation
