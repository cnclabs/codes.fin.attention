item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect changes in presenting the geographic areas in which we conduct our operations 
these areas consist of the north comprised of the east and rocky mountain areas and south comprised of the gulf coast and anadarko areas 
in previous periods  we presented the geographic areas as east  gulf coast  west and canada 
statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed

table of contents 
index to financial statements we operate in one segment  natural gas and oil development  exploitation and exploration  exclusively within the united states 
in april  we sold substantially all of our canadian properties to a private canadian company 
overview cabot oil gas corporation is a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the development  exploitation  exploration  production and marketing of natural gas  and to a lesser extent  crude oil and natural gas liquids from its properties in the continental us we also transport  store  gather and produce natural gas for resale 
our exploitation and exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources  which are conducive to multi well  repeatable drilling programs 
our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced  with a focus on achieving strong financial returns 
at cabot  we evaluate three types of investment alternatives that compete for available capital drilling opportunities  financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock and acquisition opportunities 
depending on circumstances  we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rate of return approach 
our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time 
at any one time  one or more of these may not be economically feasible 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms 
price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years 
throughout commodity index prices in general traded in a range significantly below recent highs 
however  our realized natural gas and crude oil price was per mcf and per bbl  respectively  in and were significantly increased by our positions from our derivative instruments  which contributed approximately of our realized revenues in in an effort to manage commodity price risk  we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price swaps and collars 
these financial instruments are an important element of our risk management strategy 
commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control 
historically  commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand  which are impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future natural gas  ngl and crude oil prices and  therefore  we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 
in addition to production volumes and commodity prices  finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success 
see risk factors natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely  and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factors our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item a 
the tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated by month over and index represents the first of the month henry hub index price per mmbtu

crude oil revenues remained flat from to primarily due to increased crude oil production and favorable oil hedge settlements  offset by a decrease in realized prices 
prices  including the realized impact of derivative instruments  decreased by for natural gas and for oil 
we drilled gross wells with a success rate of in compared to gross wells with a success rate of in total capital and exploration expenditures decreased by million to million in compared to  million including the east texas acquisition in this decrease was largely due to the million acquisition of east texas assets in and a decrease of million in total drilling 
we believe our cash on hand and operating cash flow in will be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital and exploration spending of approximately million 
any additional needs are expected to be funded by borrowings from our credit facility 
our strategy will remain consistent with we will remain focused on our strategies of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our accumulated acreage position 
additionally  we intend to maintain spending discipline and manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure sufficient liquidity  including cash resources and available credit 
in the current year we have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures primarily to the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania  and to a lesser extent east texas 
we believe these strategies are appropriate for our portfolio of projects and the current industry environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the long term 
the preceding paragraphs  discussing our strategic pursuits and goals  contain forward looking information 
please read forward looking information for further details 
financial condition capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of cash in were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production including hedge realizations and  to a lesser extent  the sales of properties during the year and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
these cash flows were primarily used to fund our development and exploratory expenditures  in addition to payments for debt service  debt issuance costs  contributions to our pension plan and dividends 
see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil 
operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes 
prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been volatile  including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season  however  the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years 
commodity prices have recently experienced increased volatility due to adverse market conditions in our economy 
in addition  fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures 
see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales 
our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above 
from time to time  our working capital will reflect a surplus  while at other times it will reflect a deficit 
this fluctuation is not unusual 
we believe we have adequate credit availability and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements 
year ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
key components impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices  production volumes and operating costs 
net cash provided by operating activities in decreased by million over this decrease was mainly due to a decrease in oil and gas revenues  partially offset by lower operating  interest and tax expense 
average realized natural gas prices decreased by in compared to and average realized crude oil prices decreased by over the same period 
equivalent production volumes increased by in compared to as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production 
we are unable to predict future commodity prices and  as a result  cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 
realized prices may continue to decline during for  we had natural gas price swaps covering bcf of our gas production at an average price of per mcf and natural gas price collars covering bcf of our gas production  with a weighted average floor of per mcf and a weighted average ceiling of per mcf 
as of december   we have natural gas price swaps covering bcf of our gas production at an average price of per mcf  and no natural gas price collars 
accordingly  based on our current hedge position  we will be more subject to the effects of natural gas price volatility in than in in addition  given the current market for derivatives  if we were to hedge all our production  we would expect our realized prices to be lower than our realized prices 
net cash provided by operating activities in increased by million over this increase was mainly due to an increase in net income  the receipt of cash of million in in connection with the settlement of a dispute and an increase of million in cash received for income tax refunds 
in addition  cash flows from operating activities increased as a result of other working capital changes 
average realized natural gas prices increased by in over and average realized crude oil prices increased by over the same period 
equivalent production volumes increased by in compared to as a result of higher natural gas production 
see results of operations for a discussion on commodity prices and a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales revenue 
investing activities 
the primary uses of cash in investing activities were capital spending and exploration expenses 
we established the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices 
table of contents 
index to financial statements and cash flows 
due to the volatility of commodity prices and new opportunities which may arise  our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased by million from to and increased by million from to the decrease from to was due to a decrease of million in acquisitions and capital expenditures and an increase of million of proceeds from the sale of assets  partially offset by an increase of million in exploration expenditures 
in august  we completed the acquisition of producing properties  leasehold acreage and a natural gas gathering infrastructure in east texas for total net cash consideration of approximately million 
the increase from to was due to an increase of million in capital expenditures  including an increase of approximately million primarily due to the million east texas acquisition and an increase of million related to unproved leasehold acquisitions primarily in northeast pennsylvania 
in addition  there were million of lower proceeds from the sale of assets in compared to partially offsetting these increases to cash used in investing activities were decreased exploration expenditures of million in compared to financing activities 
cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by million from to this was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings from debt of million  partially offset by a decrease in repayments of debt of million  and a decrease in net proceeds from the sale of common stock of million primarily due to our june issuance of  shares of common stock in a public offering 
common stock proceeds and debt borrowings in were largely used to finance the acquisition of east texas properties and undeveloped acreage 
cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs and dividends increased by a total of million  partially offset by an increase of million in the tax benefit associated with stock based compensation 
cash flows provided by financing activities increased by million from to this was primarily due to an increase in debt consisting of our july and december private placements of debt million and an increase of million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
additionally  net proceeds from the sale of common stock increased by million primarily due to the june issuance of common stock 
the tax benefit for stock based compensation increased by million from to  but was partially offset by an increase in dividends and capitalized debt issuance costs paid 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our unsecured credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
in april  we entered into a new revolving credit facility and terminated our prior credit facility 
the new credit facility provides for an available credit line of million and contains an accordion feature allowing us to increase the available credit line to million  if any one or more of the existing banks or new banks agree to provide such increased commitment amount 
the available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks based on our reserve reports and engineering reports and certain other assets and the outstanding principal balance of our senior notes 
we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity 
our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt 
management believes that  with internally generated cash  existing cash and availability under our revolving credit facility  we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our strong financial position 
at the same time  we will closely monitor the capital markets 
in july  we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes with a weighted average interest rate of  consisting of amounts due in july  and in december  we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in december please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
in june  we entered into an underwriting agreement pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock at a price to us of per share 
we received million in net 
table of contents 
index to financial statements proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
these net proceeds were used temporarily to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility prior to funding a portion of the purchase price of our east texas acquisition  which closed in the third quarter of immediately prior to and in connection with this issuance  we retired  shares of treasury stock  which had a weighted average purchase price of 
capitalization information about our capitalization is as follows december  dollars in millions debt stockholders equity total capitalization debt to capitalization cash and cash equivalents includes million of current portion of long term debt at december  includes million and million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   we paid dividends of million per share on our common stock 
a regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in capital and exploration expenditures on an annual basis  we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities  excluding any significant oil and gas property acquisitions  with cash generated from operations and  when necessary  our revolving credit facility 
we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 
the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december  in millions capital expenditures drilling and facilities leasehold acquisitions acquisitions pipeline and gathering other exploration expense total includes canadian currency translation effects of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we plan to drill approximately gross wells net in compared with gross wells net drilled in the number of net wells we plan to drill in is up slightly from this drilling 
table of contents 
index to financial statements program includes approximately million in total capital and exploration expenditures  down from million in this decline is primarily due to lower projected lease acquisition expenditures 
we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 
there are many factors that impact our depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a rate 
these include reserve additions and revisions  development costs  impairments and changes in anticipated production in future periods 
in  management expects an increase in our dd a rate due to higher capital costs  partially as a result of inflationary cost pressures in the industry over the last four years and increased lease acquisition costs in pennsylvania 
this change is currently estimated to be approximately greater than levels 
this increase will not have an impact on our cash flows 
contractual obligations our material contractual obligations include long term debt  interest on long term debt  firm gas transportation agreements  drilling rig commitments and operating leases 
we have no off balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  are set forth in the following table total payments due by year to to beyond in thousands long term debt interest on long term debt firm gas transportation agreements drilling rig commitments operating leases total contractual cash obligations at december   we had million of debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details of long term debt 
interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates of our million long term debt outstanding at december  interest payments on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the december  outstanding balance of million will be outstanding through the april maturity date 
a constant interest rate of was assumed  which was the weighted average interest rate 
actual results will differ from these estimates and assumptions 
for further information on our obligations under firm gas transportation agreements  drilling rig commitments and operating leases  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures 
the total amount of asset retirement obligations at december  was million  up from million at december   primarily due to million of accretion expense during as well as million of drilling additions 
potential impact of our critical accounting policies readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the most significant policies are discussed below 

table of contents 
index to financial statements oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise  and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices 
additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
since  of our reserves have been reviewed by miller lents  ltd  an independent oil and gas reservoir engineering consulting firm  who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate 
in we had a net downward revision of bcfe primarily due to i downward revisions of bcfe due to lower oil and natural gas prices compared to and ii downward revisions of bcfe due to the removal of proved undeveloped reserves scheduled for development beyond five years primarily due to the application of the sec s new oil and gas reserve calculation methodology  partially offset by bcfe of positive performance revisions 
in accordance with the new rules we priced proved oil and gas reserves using the month average oil and gas index prices  calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month within the month period prior to the end of the reporting period 
we did not record significant reserve revisions during and for more information regarding reserve estimation  including historical reserve revisions  refer to the supplemental oil and gas information 
our rate of recording dd a expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves  which is utilized in our unit of production method calculation 
if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced  the rate at which we record dd a expense would increase  reducing net income 
such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices  which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the company would decrease or increase the dd a rate by approximately to per mcfe 
revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dd a rate 
it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of in one of our most productive fields would have a to per mcfe impact on our total dd a rate 
these estimated impacts are based on current data  and actual events could require different adjustments to our dd a rate 
in addition  a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under accounting standards codification asc  property  plant  and equipment 
due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process  risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis  management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 
carrying value of oil and gas properties we evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a field by field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset 
if the future undiscounted expected cash flows  based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials  as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows 
the discount factor used at december  is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil 
in  and  there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test 
in the event that commodity prices remain low or continue to decline  there could be a significant revision in the future 

table of contents 
index to financial statements costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above  however  a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives 
average property lives are determined on a regional basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights 
historically  the average property life in each of the regions has not significantly changed 
during the latter part of and during  commodity prices declined at a significant rate as the global economy struggled with a worldwide recession 
this price environment has resulted in reduced capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling 
we have considered these impacts discussed above when assessing the impairment of our undeveloped acreage  especially in exploratory areas 
if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year  the amortization would increase by approximately million or decrease by approximately million  respectively per year 
in the past  based on the customary terms of the leases  the average leasehold life in the south region has been shorter than the average life in the north region 
average property lives in the north and south regions have been five and three years  respectively 
as these properties are developed and reserves are proven  the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful  the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made 
the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration program 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities we follow the accounting prescribed in asc under asc  the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
at the end of each quarterly period  these instruments are marked to market 
the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of equity  to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective 
under asc  effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale 
for example  a natural gas price swap that converts henry hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated  and effective  if the underlying gas were sold at the henry hub index 
the ineffective portion  if any  of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges  and the change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges  is recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas production and crude oil and condensate revenue  as appropriate in the consolidated statement of operations 
fair value measurements effective january   we adopted those provisions of asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  that were required to be adopted which excluded certain non financial assets and liabilities 
effective january   we applied all of the provisions of asc  and this adoption did not have a material impact on any of our financial statements except for our impairment of oil and gas properties see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in the future  areas that could cause an impact would primarily be limited to asset impairments  including long lived assets  asset retirement obligations and assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  if any 
as defined in asc  fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
the transaction is based on a hypothetical transaction in the principal or most advantageous market considered from the perspective of the market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability 
we utilize market data or assumptions that market participants who are independent  knowledgeable and willing and able to transact would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated or generally unobservable 
we attempt to utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
we are able to classify fair value balances based 
table of contents 
index to financial statements on the observability of those inputs 
asc establishes a formal fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to level measurements and the lowest priority to level measurements  and accordingly  level measurements should be used whenever possible 
as of december   we had million of financial assets  or of our total assets  classified as level this was entirely comprised of our derivative receivable balance from our oil and gas cash flow hedges 
during  realized gains of million were recognized in other comprehensive income 
derivative settlements during the year totaled million 
the fair values of our natural gas and crude oil price collars and swaps are valued based upon quotes obtained from counterparties to the agreements and are designated as level such quotes have been derived using a black scholes model for the active oil and gas commodities market that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil  volatility factors and interest rates  such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term 
these estimates are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness 
we adjust the fair value quotes received by our counterparties to take into account either the counterparties nonperformance risk or our own nonperformance risk 
we measured the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions 
the resulting reduction to the net receivable derivative contract position was million 
in times where we have net derivative contract liabilities  our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by our bank 
additional disclosures are required for transactions measured at fair value and we have included these disclosures in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
long term employee benefit costs our costs of long term employee benefits  particularly pension and postretirement benefits  are incurred over long periods of time  and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties  and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is management s responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties 
it also is management s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 
the current benefit service costs  as well as the existing liabilities  for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis 
the discount rate is a current rate  related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled 
our assumed discount rate is based on average rates of return published for a theoretical portfolio of high quality fixed income securities 
in order to select the discount rate  we use benchmarks such as the moody s aa corporate rate  which was as of december   and the citigroup pension liability index  which was as of december  we look to these benchmarks as well as considering durations of expected benefit payments 
we have determined based on these assumptions that a discount rate of at december  is reasonable 
in order to value our pension liabilities  we use the irs static mortality table based on the demographics of our benefit plans 
we have also assumed that salaries will increase four percent based on our expectation of future salary increases 
the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
as of december   the assumed rate of increase was 
the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption 
the expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate  and reflects long term expectations  rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 
the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets 
management s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we have established objectives regarding plan assets in the pension plan 
we attempt to maximize return over the long term  subject to appropriate levels of risk 
one of our plan objectives is that the performance of the equity portion of the pension plan exceed the standard and poors index over the long term 
we also seek to achieve a minimum five percent annual real rate of return above the rate of inflation on the total portfolio over the long term 
we establish the long term expected rate of return by developing a forward looking long term expected rate of return assumption for each asset class  taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation 
in our pension calculations  we have used eight percent as the expected long term return on plan assets for  and a monte carlo simulation was run using  simulations based upon our actual asset allocation and liability duration  which has been determined to be approximately years 
this model uses historical data for the period of for stocks  bonds and cash to determine the best estimate range of future returns 
the median rate of return  or return that we expect to achieve over percent of the time  is approximately nine percent 
we expect to achieve at a minimum approximately seven percent annual real rate of return on the total portfolio over the long term at least percent of the time 
we believe that the eight percent chosen is a reasonable estimate based on our actual results 
we generally target a portfolio of assets utilizing equity securities  fixed income securities and cash equivalents that are within a range of approximately to for equity securities and approximately to for fixed income securities 
large capitalization equities may make up a maximum of of the portfolio 
small capitalization equities and international equities may make up a maximum of and  respectively  of the portfolio 
fixed income bonds may make up a maximum of of our portfolio 
the account will typically be fully invested  however  as a temporary investment or an asset protection measure  part of the account may be invested in money market investments up to 
one percent of the portfolio is invested in short term funds at the designated bank to meet the cash flow needs of the plan 
no prohibited investments  including direct or indirect investments in commodities  commodity futures  derivatives  short sales  real estate investment trusts  letter stock  restricted stock or other private placements  are allowed without prior committee approval 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under a fair value based method of accounting prescribed under asc for stock options and similar equity instruments 
under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
to calculate the fair value  either a binomial or black scholes valuation model may be used 
stock based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
stock options and stock appreciation rights sars are granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low trading price of our stock on the grant date 
the grant date fair value is calculated by using a black scholes model that incorporates assumptions for stock price volatility  risk free rate of return  expected dividend and expected term 
the expected term was derived by reviewing minimum and maximum expected term outputs from the black scholes model based on award type and employee type 
this term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding 
the stock price volatility was calculated using our historical closing stock price data for the period associated with the expected term through the grant date of each award 
the risk free rate of return percentages are based on the continuously compounded equivalent of the us treasury nominal within the expected term as measured on the grant date 
the expected dividend percentage assumes that we will continue to pay a consistent level of dividend each quarter 
expense is recorded based on a graded vesting schedule over a three year service period  with one third of the award becoming exercisable each year on the anniversary date of the grant 
the forfeiture rate is determined based on the forfeiture history by type of award and by the group of individuals receiving the award 
the fair value of restricted stock awards  restricted stock units and certain performance share awards which contain vesting restrictions based either on operating income or internal performance metrics are measured 
table of contents 
index to financial statements based on the average of the high and low trading price of our stock on the grant date 
restricted stock awards primarily vest either at the end of a three year service period  or on a graded vesting basis of one third at each anniversary date over a three year service period 
the annual forfeiture rate for restricted stock awards ranges from to based on approximately ten years of our history for this type of award to various employee groups 
performance shares that vest based on operating income or operating cash flow metrics vest on a graded vesting basis of one third at each anniversary date over a three year service period and no forfeiture rate is assumed 
performance shares that vest based on internal metrics vest at the end of a three year performance period and an annual forfeiture rate of is assumed 
expense for restricted stock units is recorded immediately as these awards vest immediately 
restricted stock units are granted only to our directors and no forfeiture rate is assumed 
we grant another type of performance share award to executive employees that vest at the end of a three year performance period based on the comparative performance of our stock measured against sixteen other companies in our peer group 
depending on our performance  an aggregate of up to of the fair market value of a share of our stock may be payable in common stock plus up to an additional of the fair market value of a share of our stock may be payable in cash 
these awards are accounted for by bifurcating the equity and liability components 
a monte carlo model is used to value the liability component as well as the equity portion of the certain awards on the date of grant 
the four primary inputs for the monte carlo model are the risk free rate  volatility of returns  correlation in movement of total shareholder return and the expected dividend 
an interpolated risk free rate was generated from the federal reserve website for constant maturity treasuries for one and two year bonds as of the reporting date set equal to the remaining duration of the performance period 
volatility was set equal to the annualized daily volatility for the remaining duration of the reporting period ending on the reporting date 
correlation in movement of total shareholder return was determined based on a correlation matrix that was created which identifies total shareholder return correlations for each pair of companies in the peer group  including us 
the paired returns in the correlation matrix ranged from approximately to approximately for us and our peer group 
the expected dividend is calculated using our annual dividends paid per share for divided by the december  closing price of our stock 
based on these inputs discussed above  a ranking was projected identifying our rank relative to the peer group for each award period 
no forfeiture rate is assumed for this type of award 
expense related to these awards can be volatile based on our comparative ranking at the end of each quarter 
we used the shortcut approach to derive our initial windfall tax benefit pool 
we chose to use a one pool approach which combines all awards granted to employees  including non employee directors 
on january   our board of directors adopted a supplemental employee incentive plan 
the plan was intended to provide a compensation tool tied to stock market value creation to serve as an incentive and retention vehicle for full time non officer employees by providing for cash payments in the event our common stock reached specified trading prices 
the bonus payout of a minimum of of an employee s base salary was triggered if  for any trading days which need not be consecutive that fell within a period of consecutive trading days occurring on or before november   the closing price per share of our common stock equaled or exceeded the final price goal of per share 
the plan also provided that an interim distribution of of an employee s base salary would be paid to eligible employees upon achieving the interim price goal of per share prior to december  on the january  adoption date of the plan  our closing stock price was 
on april  and subsequently on june   we achieved the interim and final target goals and total distributions of million were paid in no further distributions will be made under this plan 
on july   our board of directors adopted a second supplemental employee incentive plan plan ii 
plan ii is similar to the january supplemental incentive plan  however  the final target is that the closing price per share of our common stock must equal or exceed the price goal of per share on or before june  under plan ii  each eligible employee may receive upon approval by the compensation

index to financial statements committee a distribution of of his or her base salary or of base salary if we paid interim distributions upon the achievement of the interim price goal discussed below 
plan ii provides that a distribution of of an eligible employee s base salary upon achieving the interim price goal of per share on or before june  the compensation committee can increase the or payment as it applies to any employee 
payments under this plan will partially be paid within business days after achieving the target and the remaining portion will be paid based on a separate payment date as described in plan ii 
these awards under both plans discussed above have been accounted for as liability awards under asc the total expense for and was million and million  respectively  and is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
for further information regarding the supplemental employee incentive plans and our other stock based compensation awards  please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
other issues and contingencies regulations 
our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
see regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production  natural gas marketing  gathering and transportation  federal regulation of petroleum and environmental regulations in the other business matters section of item for a discussion of these regulations 
restrictive covenants 
our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments 
among other requirements  our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of to in addition  we are required to maintain an asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus working capital to debt of to and a current ratio of to our senior notes require us to maintain a ratio of cash and proved reserves to indebtedness and other liabilities of to at december   we were in compliance in all material respects with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and notes 
in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants  we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender  which  if granted  would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation 
see further discussion in capital resources and liquidity 
operating risks and insurance coverage 
our business involves a variety of operating risks 
see risk factors we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item a 
in accordance with customary industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks and losses 
the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate 
commodity pricing and risk management activities 
our revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
declines in oil and gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
historically  oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results 
in particular  substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment under asc  property  plant  and equipment 
because our reserves are predominantly natural gas  changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 
the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices 
generally  if the related commodity index falls  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
however  management may mitigate this price 
table of contents 
index to financial statements risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of derivative financial instruments 
most recently  we have used financial instruments such as price collars and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue 
under both arrangements  there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions 
settlement of dispute 
in december  we settled a dispute with a third party and as a result recorded a gain of million approximately million after tax 
the dispute involved the propriety of possession of our intellectual property by a third party 
the settlement was comprised of million in cash paid by the third party to us and million related to the fair value of unproved property rights transferred by the third party to us 
the fair market value of the unproved property rights was determined based on observable market costs and conditions over a recent time period 
values were pro rated by property based on the primary term remaining on the properties

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our primary market risk is exposure to oil and natural gas prices 
realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for north american natural gas production 
commodity prices are volatile and unpredictable 
the debt and equity markets have recently experienced unfavorable conditions  which may affect our ability to access those markets 
as a result of the volatility and disruption in the capital markets and our increased level of borrowings  we may experience increased costs associated with future borrowings and debt issuances 
at this time  we do not believe our liquidity has been materially affected by the recent market events 
we will continue to monitor events and circumstances surrounding each of our lenders in our revolving credit facility 

table of contents 
index to financial statements derivative instruments and hedging activity our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets 
a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity 
our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection 
these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices  but offer protection in the event of price declines 
further  if our counterparties defaulted  this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges 
please read the discussion below as well as note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 
periodically  we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production 
our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks 
at december   we had cash flow hedges open natural gas price swap arrangements and one crude oil price swap arrangement 
during  we entered into six new derivative contracts covering anticipated natural gas production for these natural gas basis swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting under asc these natural gas basis swaps mitigate the risk associated with basis differentials that may expand or increase over time  thus reducing the exposure and risk of basis fluctuations

also impacting the total unrealized net gain reflecting the net receivable position in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheet is a reduction of million related to our assessment of our counterparties nonperformance risk 
this risk was primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions 
from time to time  we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production 
these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes 
under these price swaps  we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index  such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 
during  four natural gas price swaps covered  mmcf  or  of our gas production at an average price of per mcf 
we had one crude oil price swap covering mbbl  or  of our oil production at a price of per bbl 

table of contents 
index to financial statements from time to time  we enter into natural gas and crude oil collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production 
these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes 
under the collar arrangements  if the index price rises above the ceiling price  we pay the counterparty 
if the index price falls below the floor price  the counterparty pays us 
during  natural gas price collars covered  mmcf  or  of our gas production  with a weighted average floor of per mcf and a weighted average ceiling of per mcf 
we are exposed to market risk on these open contracts  to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged

fair market value of financial instruments the estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties 
the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value 
the fair value of long term debt is the estimated cost to acquire the debt  including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the year end market rate
