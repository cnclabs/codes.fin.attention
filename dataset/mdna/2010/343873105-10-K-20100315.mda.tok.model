as used in this discussion and analysis  the words we  us  our and the company are used to refer to flushing financial corporation and our consolidated subsidiaries  including flushing savings bank  fsb the savings bank and flushing commercial bank the commercial bank and together with the savings bank  the banks 
general we are a delaware corporation organized in may at the direction of the savings bank 
the savings bank was organized in as a new york state chartered mutual savings bank 
in  the savings bank converted to a federally chartered mutual savings bank and changed its name from flushing savings bank to flushing savings bank  fsb 
the savings bank converted from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank in as a federal savings bank  the savings bank s primary regulator is the office of thrift supervision ots 
the banks deposits are insured to the maximum allowable amount by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the savings bank owns four subsidiaries flushing commercial bank  flushing preferred funding corporatio n  flushing service corporation  and fsb properties inc flushing financial corporation also owns flushing financial capital trust ii  flushing financial capital trust iii  and flushing financial capital trust iv the trusts  which are special purpose business trusts formed during to issue a total of million of capital securities  and million of common securities which are the only voting securities 
flushing financial corporation owns of the common securities of the trusts 
the trusts used the proceeds from the issuance of these securities to purchase junior subordinated debentures from flushing financial corporation 
flushing financial corporation previously owned flushing financial capital trust i trust i  which was a special purpose business trust formed in similar to the trusts discussed above 
trust i called its outstanding ca pital securities during july  and was then liquidated 
the trusts are not included in our consolidated financial statements as we would not absorb the losses of the trusts if losses were to occur 
the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations includes the collective results of the flushing financial corporation and its subsidiaries collectively  the company  but reflects principally the savings bank s activities 
management views the company as operating as a single unit a community savings bank 
therefore  segment information is not provided 
on november   we launched a new internet branch  igobanking 
com  a division of the savings bank 
igobanking 
com provides access to markets outside our geographic locations 
during  the savings bank formed a wholly owned subsidiary  flushing commercial bank  a new york state chartered commercial bank  for the limited purpose of providing banking services to public entities including counties  cities  towns  villages  school districts  libraries  fire districts and the various courts throughout the new york metropolitan area 
the commercial bank was formed in response to new york state law  which requires that municipal deposits and state funds must be deposited into a bank or trust company as defined in new york state law 
the savings bank is not considered an eligible bank or trust company for this purpose 
on december  we entered into a letter agreement including the securities purchase agreement standard terms incorporated by reference therein  the purchase agreement with the us department of the treasury the us treasury pursuant to which we issued and sold to the us treasury i  shares of the our fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock series b having a liquidation preference of  per share the series b preferred stock  and ii a ten year warrant the warrant to purchase up to  shares of the our common stock  par value per share  at an initial price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
the series b preferred stock qualified as tier i capital under the risk based capital guidel ines of the ots tier capital and paid cumulative dividends at a rate of per annum 
dividends were payable on the series b preferred stock quarterly and were payable on february  may  august and november of each year 
the series b preferred stock had no maturity date and ranked senior to the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation 
the warrant would have expired ten years from the issuance date and was immediately exercisable and transferable 
the purchase agreement contained limitations on the payment of dividends on and the repurchase of the common stock and certain preferred stock 
the purchase agreement also required that  until such time as the us treasury ceased to own any securities acquired from us thereunder  we take all necessary action to ensure that benefit plans with respect to senior executive officers complied with section b of eesa as implemented by any guidance or regulation under section b of eesa that had been issued and was in effect as of the date of issuance of the series b preferred stock and the warrant and not adopt any benefit plans with respect to  or which cover  senior executive officers that do not comply with eesa 
our senior executive officers consented to the foregoing 
during  we issued  in a public offering  million common shares for total consideration  after expenses  of million 
this public offering was a qualified equity offering as defined in the warrant 
as a result of this qualified equity offering  the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrant were reduced by one half 
on october   we redeemed the series b preferred stock for million plus all accrued and unpaid dividends 
on december   we repurchased the warrant for million 
at the time we redeemed the preferred stock  we wrote off the unamortized issuance costs of the preferred stock of million 
this write off reduced diluted earnings per common share by for the full year of overview our principal business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits together with funds generated from ongoing operations and borrowings  primarily in originations and purchases of one to four family focusing on mixed use properties  which are properties that contain both residential dwelling units and commercial units  multi family residential and  to a lesser extent  commercial real estate mortgage loans  construction loans  primarily for residential properties  small business administration sba loans and other small business loans  mortgage loan surrogates such as mortgage backed securities  and us government securities  corporate fixed income securities and other marketable securities 
we also originate certain other consumer loans 
our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its interest earning assets and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is the result of our interest rate margin  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  adjusted for the difference in the average balance of interest earning assets as compared to the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
we also generate non interest income from loan fees  service charges on deposit accounts  mortgage servicing fees  and other fees  income earned on bank owned life insurance boli  dividends on federal home bank of new york fhlb ny stock and net gains and losses on sales of securities and loans 
our operating expenses consist principally of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  other general and administrative expenses and income tax expense 
our results of operations also can be significantly affected by our periodic provision for loan losses and specific provision for losses on real estate owned 
management strategy 
our strategy is to continue our focus on being an institution serving consumers  businesses  and governmental units in our local markets 
in furtherance of this objective  we intend to continue our emphasis on the origination of multi family residential and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans  transition from a traditional thrift to a more commercial like banking institution  increase our commitment to the multi cultural marketplace  with a particular focus on the asian community in queens  maintain asset quality  manage deposit growth and maintain a low cost of funds through business banking deposits  municipal deposits through government banking  and new customer relationships via igobanking 
com  cross sell to lending and deposit customers  take advantage of market disruptions to attract talent and customers from competitors  and manage interest rate risk and capital 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively implement this strategy 
our strategy is subject to change by the board of directors 
multi family residential and one to four family lending 
in recent years  we have emphasized the origination of higher yielding multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans 
during  we reduced our emphasis on commercial real estate lending 
we expect to continue this emphasis on higher yielding multi family residential and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loan products  while we continue to deemphasize commercial real estate lending 
the following table shows loan originations and purchases during  and loan balances as of december  loan originations and purchases loan balances december  percent of gross loans dollars in thousands multi family residential commercial real estate one to four family mixed use property one to four family residential co operative apartment construction small business administration taxi medallion commercial business and other total our increased emphasis in recent years on multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans has increased the overall level of credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio 
the greater risk associated with multi family  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans could require us to increase our provisions for loan losses and to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained 
transition to a more commercial like banking institution 
we established a business banking unit during staffed with a team of experienced commercial bankers 
we have developed a complement of deposit  loan and cash management products to support this initiative  and expanded these product offerings 
the business banking unit is responsible for building business relationships in order to obtain lower costing deposits  generate fee income  and originate commercial business loans 
building these business relationships could provide us with a lower costing source of funds and higher yielding adjustable rate loans  which would help us manage our interest rate risk 
increase our commitment to the multi cultural marketplace  with a particular focus on the asian community in queens 
our branches are all located in the new york city metropolitan area with particular concentration in the borough of queens 
queens in particular exhibits a high level of ethnic diversity 
an important element of our strategy is to service the multi ethnic consumer and business 
we have a particular concentration in the asian communities among them chinese and korean populations 
both groups are noted for high levels of savings  education and entrepreneurship 
in order to service these and other important ethnic groups in our market  our staff speaks more than languages 
 we have an asian advisory board to help broaden our link to the community by providing guidance and fostering awareness of our active role in the local community 
our focus on the asian community in queens  where we have four branches  has resulted in us obtaining over million in deposits in these branches 
we also have over million of loans outstanding to borrowers in the asian community 
maintain asset quality 
by adherence to our strict underwriting standards  we have been able to minimize net losses from impaired loans with net charge offs of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we seek to maintain our loans in performing status through  among other things  strict collection efforts  and consistently monitoring non performing assets in an effort to return them to performing status 
to this end  we review the quality of our loans and report to the loan committee of the board of directors of the savings bank on a monthly basis 
we have sold and may continue to sell delinquent mortgage loans 
we sold delinquent mortgage loans totaling million  delinquent mortgage loans totaling million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we recorded  in charge offs to the allowance for loan losses for the non performing loans that were sold during we did not record any charges to the allowance for loan losses for the non performing loans that were sold during we realized gross gains of  and  on the sale of non performing mortgage loans for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we realized gross losses of  on the sale of non performing mortgage loans for the year ended december  we did not record any gross losses for the year ended december  there can be no assurances that we will continue this strategy in future periods  or if continued  we will be able to find buyers to pay adequate consideration 
non performing assets amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were and at december  and  respectively 
manage deposit growth and maintain low cost of funds 
we have a relatively stable retail deposit base drawn from our market area through our full service offices 
although we seek to retain existing deposits and maintain depositor relationships by offering quality service and competitive interest rates to our customers  we also seek to keep deposit growth within reasonable limits and our strategic plan 
in  we initiated our business banking operation that we designed specifically to develop full business relationships thereby bringing in lower cost checking and money market deposits 
at december   deposits balances in the business sector are million 
we also have an internet branch  igobanking 
com  as a division of the savings bank  to compete for deposits from sources outside the geographic footprint of our full service offices 
in creating igobanking 
com  our strategy is to reduce our reliance on wholesale borrowings and reduce our funding costs 
deposit balances in igobanking 
com were million at december   at rates lower than our current certificates of deposit base and borrowings 
during  the savings bank formed a wholly owned subsidiary  flushing commercial bank  a new york state chartered commercial bank  for the limited purpose of accepting municipal deposits and state funds  including certain court ordered funds from new york state courts  in the state of new york as an additional source of deposits 
at december   deposits in flushing commercial bank totaled million at rates below our average cost of funds 
we also obtain deposits through brokers and the cdars network 
management intend s to balance its goal to maintain competitive interest rates on deposits while seeking to manage its overall cost of funds to finance its strategies 
we generally rely on our deposit base as our principal source of funding 
in addition  the banks are members of the fhlb ny  which provides us with a source of borrowing 
we also utilize reverse purchase agreements  established with other financial institutions 
these borrowings help us fund asset growth and increase net interest income 
during  we realized an increase in due to depositors of million  with lower costing core deposits increasing million and higher costing certificates of deposit decreasing million  and a decrease in borrowings of million 
cross sell to lending and deposit customers 
a significant portion of our lending and deposit customers do not have both their loans and deposits with us 
we intend to focus on obtaining additional deposits from our lending customers and originating additional loans to our deposit customers 
product offerings were expanded in the past four years and are expected to be further expanded in to accommodate perceived customer demands 
in addition  specific employees are assigned responsibilities of generating these additional deposits and loans by coordinating efforts between lending and deposit gathering departments 
take advantage of market disruptions to attract talent and customers from competitors 
the new york city market place has been dominated by large institutions  many of which recently have run into difficult situations due to the recessionary environment 
during this time period we have been able to attract talent from such large commercial banks 
that talent has brought with it significant business relationships 
the preoccupation of our large competitors with significant profitability concerns has caused them to reduce lending and make their customer base more vulnerable 
we have been able to see a larger number of strong companies that have been caught in a retrenchment by their existing large institution 
we anticipate this environment remaining for some period of time as large banks work through their continuing problems 
we have in the past increased growth through acquisitions of financial institutions and branches of other financial institutions  and will continue to pursue growth through acquisitions that are  or are expected to be within a reasonable time frame  accretive to earnings  as well as evaluating the feasibility of opening additional branches 
we have in the past opened new branches 
in  we completed the acquisition of atlantic liberty savings and opened a branch in bayside  queens 
two branches were also opened in queens in the first quarter of  and one branch has been opened in nassau county in the first quarter of we plan to continue to seek and review potential acquisition opportunities that complement our current business  are consistent with our strategy to build a bank t hat is focused on the unique personal and small business banking needs of the multi ethnic communities we serve 
manage interest rate risk and capital 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk by actively reviewing the repricing and maturities of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the mix of loans we originate fixed or arm is determined in large part by borrowers preferences and prevailing market conditions 
we seek to manage the interest rate risk of our loan portfolio by actively managing our security portfolio and borrowings 
by adjusting the mix of fixed and adjustable rate securities  as well as the maturities of the securities  we have the ability to manage the combined interest rate sensitivity of our assets 
additionally  we seek to balance the interest rate sensitivity of our assets by managing the maturities of our liabilities 
the savings bank faces several minimum capital requirements imposed by the ots 
these requirements limit the dividends the savings bank is allowed to pay to flushing financial corporation  and can limit the annual growth of the savings bank 
trends and contingencies 
our operating results are significantly affected by national and local economic and competitive conditions  including changes in market interest rates  the strength of the local economy  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
as short term interest rates rose during the first half of  remained at those levels throughout most of  and declined throughout and  we remained strategically focused on the origination of multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans 
as a result of this strategy  we were able to continue to achieve a higher yield on our mortgage portfolio than we would have otherwise experienced 
we also established a business banking unit during the second half of  and launched an internet branch in november prevailing interest rates affect the extent to which borrowers repay and refinance loans 
in a declining interest rate environment  the number of loan prepayments and loan refinancing tends to increase  as do prepayments of mortgage backed securities 
call provisions associated with our investments in us government agency and corporate securities may also adversely affect yield in a declining interest rate environment 
such prepayments and calls may adversely affect the yield of our loan portfolio and mortgage backed and other securities as we reinvest the prepaid funds in a lower interest rate environment 
however  we typically receive additional loan fees when existing loans are refinanced  which partially offsets the reduced yield on our loan portfolio resulting from prep ayments 
in periods of low interest rates  our level of core deposits also may decline if depositors seek higher yielding instruments or other investments not offered by us  which in turn may increase our cost of funds and decrease our net interest margin to the extent alternative funding sources are utilized 
by contrast  an increasing interest rate environment would tend to extend the average lives of lower yielding fixed rate mortgages and mortgage backed securities  which could adversely affect net interest income 
in addition  depositors tend to open longer term  higher costing certificate of deposit accounts which could adversely affect our net interest income if rates were to subsequently decline 
additionally  adjustable rate residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities generally contain interim and lifetime caps that limit the amount the interest rate can increase at re pricing dates 
during the first half of  the federal reserve s federal open market committee fomc increased short term interest rates through their meeting in june  while longer term interest rates remained relatively stable 
as a result  the yield curve flattened to the point where there was little difference between the rate on overnight funds and the rate on ten year bonds 
during the second half of and through september  the fomc maintained the overnight rate  while longer term rates declined  resulting in an inverted yield curve 
as a result  our net interest margin declined as the spread between the rates we received on loans originated narrowed compared to the rates paid on new deposits 
the fomc began lowering the overnight interest rate in the fourth quarter of  and the treasury yield curve returned to a more normal slope by the end of the fomc continued to lower the overnight interest rate throughout  and maintained this low interest rate environment throughout the treasury yield curve remained positively sloped throughout and while demand for our higher yielding loan products declined during  we grew our loan portfolio million in we funded this growth with principal payments received on our securities portfolio and deposit growth 
at december   we had loan applications in process of million 
as a result of balance sheet growth combined with a basis point improvement in our net interest spread  net interest income increased million to million in from million in the yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  however  this was more than offset by a decline in the cost of funds of basis points to for the year ended december  from for the comparable prior year period 
the net interest margin increased basis points to for as compared to for the net interest margin increased to in the fourth quarter of as compared to in the fourth quar ter of the basis point decline in the cost of deposits for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was partially the result of a shift in our deposit concentrations during during the year ended december   lower costing core deposits increased million while higher costing certificates of deposit and borrowings decreased million and million  respectively 
the cost of funds declined to in the fourth quarter of from in the fourth quarter of we are unable to predict the direction of future interest rate changes 
approximately of our certificates of deposit accounts and borrowings reprice or mature during the next year  which could result in a decrease in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities 
also  in a decreasing interest rate environment  mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities with higher rates tend to prepay  which could result in a reduction in the yield on our interest earning assets 
the national and regional economies were generally considered to be in a recession from december through the middle of this resulted in increased unemployment and declining property values  although the property value declines in the new york metropolitan area have not been as great as many other areas of the country 
while the national and regional economies showed signs of improvement during the second half of  unemployment has remained at elevated levels 
these economic conditions can result in borrowers defaulting on their loans  or withdrawing their funds on deposit to meet their financial obligations 
this deterioration in the economy resulted in an increase in our non performing loans during and  with non performing loans tot aling million at december  and million at december  compared to non performing loans totaling million at december  we recorded a million provision for loan losses in however  we also saw an increase in our loan portfolio and deposits in we cannot predict the effect of these economic conditions on the company s future financial condition or operating results 
interest rate sensitivity analysis a financial institution s exposure to the risks of changing interest rates may be analyzed  in part  by examining the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturi ng or repricing within the same period 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
accordingly  a positive gap may enhance net interest income in a rising rate environment and reduce net interest income in a falling rate environment 
conversely  a negative gap may enhance net interest income in a falling rate environment and reduce net interest income in a rising rate environment 
the table below sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown that reprice or mature during a particular period was determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are based on our experience and industry averages  which generally range from to  depending on the contractual rate of interest and the underlying collateral 
money market accounts and savings accounts were assumed to have a withdrawal or run off rate of and  respectively  based on our experience 
while management bases these assumptions on actual prepayments and withdrawals experienced by us  there is no guarantee that these trends will continue in the future

does not include non interest bearing demand accounts totaling million at december  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar estimated maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates and may bear rates that differ in varying degrees from the rates that would apply upon maturity and reinvestment or upon repricing 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a significant change in the level of interes t rates  prepayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  and deposit withdrawal or run off levels  would likely deviate materially from those assumed in calculating the above table 
in the event of an interest rate increase  some borrowers may be unable to meet the increased payments on their adjustable rate debt 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes that the nature of the company s assets and liabilities remains static 
interest rates may have an effect on customer preferences for deposits and loan products 
finally  the maturity and repricing characteristics of many assets and liabilities as set forth in the above table are not governed by contract but rather by management s best judgment based on current market conditions and anticipated business strategies 
interest rate risk our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in fair value of certain investments due to changes in interest rates 
generally  the fair value of financial investments such as loans and securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
as a result  increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the fair value of our interest earning assets which could adversely affect our results of operations if such assets were sold  or  in the case of securities classified as available for sale  decreases in our stockholders equity if such securities were retained 
we manage the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a continuous basis to maximize return and adjust our exposure to interest rate risk 
on a quarterly basis  management prepares the earnings and economic exposure to changes in interest rate report for review by the board of directors  as summarized below 
this report quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and net portfolio value should interest rates go up or down shocked basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
the ots currently places its focus on the net portfolio value ratio  focusing on a rate shock up or down of basis points 
the ots uses the change in net portfolio value ratio to measure the interest rate sensitivity of the company 
net portfolio value is def ined as the market value of assets net of the market value of liabilities 
the market value of assets and liabilities is determined using a discounted cash flow calculation 
the net portfolio value ratio is the ratio of the net portfolio value to the market value of assets 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and net portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  various estimates regarding prepayment assumptions are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates

net interest income depends upon the relative amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to our consolidated statements of financial condition and consolidated statements of income for the years ended december   and  and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown

interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this is the result of a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets during compared to  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the yield of interest earning assets during compared to the decline in the yield of interest earning assets was primarily due to a basis point reduction in the yield of the loan portfolio combined with a million increase in the combined average balances of the lower yielding securities portfolio and interest earning deposits  with each having a lower yield than the average yield of total interest earning assets 
the basis point reduction in the yield of the loan portfolio to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  was primarily due to a decline in prepayment penalty income  adjustable rate loans adjusting down as rates have continued to decline  and an increase in non accrual loans for which we do not accrue interest income 
the yield on the mortgage loan portfolio declined basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the yield on the mortgage loan portfolio  excluding prepayment penalty income  declined basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decline in the yield of interest earning assets was partially offset by an increase of million in the average balance of the loan portfolio to  million for the year ended december  interest income from securities increased million  as the average balance increased million for the year ended december  to million  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the yield to during from during the increase in the average balance of the securities portfolios was used to support the activities of flushing commercial bank

the cost of certificates of deposit  money market accounts  savings accounts and now accounts decreased basis points  basis points  basis points and basis points respectively  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the cost of due to depositors was also reduced due to the banks focus on increasing lower costing core deposits

provision for loan losses 
a provision for loan losses of million was recorded for the year ended december  compared to million recorded in the year ended december  in assessing the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses  management considered the company s historical loss experience  recent trends in losses  collection policies and collection experience  trends in the volume of non performing loans  changes in the composition and volume of the gross loan portfolio  and local and national economic conditions 
the provision for loan losses recorded in was primarily due to an increase in both non performing loans and the level of charge offs recorded in this increase in non performing loans primarily consist s of mortgage loans collateralized by residential income producing properties that are located in the new york city metropolitan market 
prior to  the savings bank had recorded minimal losses on mortgage loans 
the savings bank continues to maintain conservative underwriting standards that include  among other things  a loan to value ratio of or less and a debt coverage ratio of at least 
however  given the increase in non performing loans  the current economic uncertainties  and the charge offs recorded during  management  as a result of the regular quarterly analysis of the allowance for loans losses  deemed it necessary to record an additional provision for loan losses in the year ended the ratio of non performing loans to gross loans was and at december  and  respectively

occupancy and equipment  data processing  and depreciation and amortization increased million  million and million  respectively  primarily due to the growth of the bank 
other operating expense increased million primarily due an increase in foreclosure expense as non performing loans increased from the prior year period

the efficiency ratio was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income tax provisions 
income tax expense for the year ended december  increased million to million  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributed to the increase of million in income before income taxes combined with an increase in the effective tax rate to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate was the result of an increase in net income before income taxes combined with a decline in tax preference items for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and general

return on average assets decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  return on average equity increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was the result of a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets during compared to  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the yield of interest earning assets during compared to the decline in the yield of interest earning assets was primarily due to a basis point reduction in the yield of the loan portfolio combined with a million increase in the combined average balances of the lower yielding securities portfolio and interest earning deposits  wi th each having a lower yield than the average yield of total interest earning assets 
the basis point reduction in the yield of the loan portfolio to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  was primarily the result of adjustable rate loans adjusting downward  as rates declined throughout additionally  an increase in non accrual loans reduced the yield of the loan portfolio 
the yield was positively impacted by the average rate on mortgage loans originated during the twelve months ended december  being higher than the average rate of both the existing loan portfolio and mortgage loans that were paid in full during the period 
the yield on the mortgage loan portfolio declined basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the yield on the mortgage loan portfolio  excluding prepayment penalty income  declined basis points to for the year en ded december  from for the year ended december  the decline in the yield of interest earning assets was partially offset by an increase of million in the average balance of the loan portfolio to  million for the year ended december  interest income from securities increased million  as the average balance increased million for the year ended december  to million  combined with an basis point increase in the yield to during from during the increase in the average balance of the securities portfolios was primary to support the activities of flushing commercial bank

interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  an increase of million in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities was partly offset by a basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities was primarily attributed to the fomc lowering the overnight interest rate to a range of to as of december  certificates of deposit  money market accounts and saving accounts decreased ba sis points  basis points and basis points respectively  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  now accounts increased basis points for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to the introduction and promotion of new products which  although carrying a higher rate than other products in these types of accounts  had a lower rate during the year ended december  than the average cost of deposits

provision for loan losses 
a provision for loan losses of million was recorded for the year ended december  there was no provision for loan losses for the year ended december  in assessing the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses  management considered the company s historical loss experience  recent trends in losses  collection policies and collection experience  trends in the volume of non performing loans  changes in the composition and volume of the gross loan portfolio  and local and national economic conditions 
the provision for loan losses recorded in was primarily due to an increase in non performing loans 
this increase in non performing loans primarily consisted of mortgage loans that are located in the new york city metropolitan market 
historically  through december   we had not incurred losses on mortgage loans  primarily due to our conservative underwriting standards that include  among other things  a loan to value ratio of or less and a debt coverage ratio of at least 
however  given the increase in non performing loans and current economic uncertainties  management  as a result of the regular quarterly analyses of the allowance for loans losses  deemed it necessary to record additional provisions for possible loan losses in the year ended december  the ratio of non performing loans to gross loans was and at december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as percentage of non performing loans was and at december  and  respectively 
the ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans was and at december  and  respectively 
the company experienced net charge offs of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased million  or  for the year ended december  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  increases of million in the net gain attributed to changes in fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value  million in dividends received from fhlb ny stock  and million in income from bank owned life insurance were more than offset by a million decrease in fee income and a million increase in other than temporary impairment charges recorded during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the net gain in fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value was primarily the result of widening credit spreads in credit markets on trust preferred securities and the related junior subordinated debentures 
the other than temporary impairment charges in both years were on the preferred stock issues of freddie mac and fannie mae  two government sponsored entities 
these preferred shares were written down to their market value of million at december  the year ended december  included income of million representing a partial recovery of a loss sustained in  on a worldcom  inc senior note 
this amount was received as a result of a class action litigation settlement  and was included in other income 
non interest expense 
non interest expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  the increase from the comparable prior year period was primarily attributed to increases of million in employee salary and benefits  million in professional services and million in data processing expense  each of which is primarily attributed to the growth of the bank over the twelve months ended december  additionally  other operating expense increased million  primarily due to an increase in deposit insurance expense 
the efficiency ratio was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income tax provisions 
income tax expense for the year ended december  increased million to million  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributed to the increase of million in income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate was for the year ended december   the same as that for the year ended december  liquidity  regulatory capital and capital resources our primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  principal and interest payments on loans  mortgage backed and other securities  and proceeds from sales of securities and loans 
deposit flows and mortgage prepayments  however  are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
at december   the savings bank had an approved overnight line of credit of million with the fhlb ny 
in total  as of december   the savings bank may borrow up to  million from the fhlb ny in federal home loan advances and overnight lines of credit 
as of december   the savings bank had million in fhlb ny advances 
in addition  flushing financial corporation has junior subordinated debentures with a face amount of million and a carrying amount of million which are included in borrowed funds and the savings bank had million in repurchase agreements to fund lending and investment opportunities 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
management believes its available sources of funds are sufficient to fund current operations 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  which include cash and due from banks  overnight interest earning deposits and federal funds sold with original maturities of days or less 
the level of these assets is dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  a decrease of million from december  we also held marketable securities available for sale with a carrying value of million at december at december   we had commitments to extend credit principally real estate mortgage loans of million and open lines of credit for borrowers principally construction loan and home equity loan lines of credit of million 
since generally all of the loan commitments are expected to be drawn upon  the total loan commitments approximate future cash requirements  whereas the amounts of lines of credit may not be indicative of our future cash requirements 
the loan commitments generally expire in days  while construction loan lines of credit mature within months and home equity loan lines of credit mature within years 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
our total interest and operating expenses in were million and million  respectively 
certificate of deposit accounts that are scheduled to mature in one year or less as of december  totaled million 
we maintain three postretirement defined benefit plans for our employees a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which was frozen as of september   a contributory medical plan  and a noncontributory life insurance plan 
the life insurance plan was amended to discontinue providing life insurance benefits to future retirees after january  we also maintain a noncontributory defined benefit plan for certain of our non employee directors  which was frozen as of january  the employee pension plan is the only plan that we have funded 
during  we did not make a contribution to the employee pension plan  and incurred cash expenditures of million for the medical and life insurance plans and million for the non employee director plan 
we expect to pay similar amounts for these plans in see no te of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
the amounts reported in our financial statements are obtained from reports prepared by independent actuaries  and are based on significant assumptions 
the most significant assumption is the discount rate used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo for these plans 
the apbo is the present value of projected benefits that employees and retirees have earned to date 
the discount rate is a single rate at which the liabilities of the plans are discounted into today s dollars and could be effectively settled or eliminated 
the discount rate used is based on the citigroup pension liability index  and reflects a rate that could be earned on bonds over a similar period that we anticipate the plans liabilities will be paid 
an increase in the discount rate would reduce the apbo  while a reduction in the discount rate would increase the apbo 
during the past several years  when interest rates have been at historically low levels  the discount rate used for our plans has declined from for to for this decline in the discount rate has resulted in an increase in our apbo 
the company s actuaries use several other assumptions that could have a significant impact on our apbo and periodic expense for these plans 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the rate of increase in future compensation levels  expected rate of return on plan assets  future increases in medical and life insurance premiums  turnover rates of employees  and life expectancy 
the accounting standards for postretirement plans involve mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility of earnings by allowing changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations to be amortized over time when actual results differ from the assumptions used  there are changes in the assumptions used  or there are plan amendments 
at december   our employee pension plan and medical and life insurance plan have unrecognized losses of million and million  respectively 
the non employee director plan has a million unrecognized gain  due to experience different from what had been estimated and changes in actuarial assumptions 
the employee pension plan s unrecognized loss is primarily attributed to the reduction in the discount rate over the past several years and the net decline in the market value of the pension plan s investments  which was the result of the decline in the major stock markets in the medical and life insurance plans unrecognized loss is attributed to the reduction in the discount rate over the past several years 
in addition  the non employee director pension plan has an unrecognized past service liability of million due to plan amendments in prior years and the medical and life insurance plan have a million past service credit due to plan amendments 
the life insurance plan was amended to discontinue providing life insurance bene fits to future retirees after january  the net after tax effect of the unrecognized gains and losses associated with these plans has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity  resulting in a reduction of stockholders equity of million as of december  the change in the discount rate  the reduction in medical premiums and discontinued life insurance benefits to future retirees are the only significant changes made to the assumptions used for these plans for each of the years in the three years ended december  during the years ended december  and the actual return on the employee pension plan s assets has approximated the assumed return used to determine the periodic pension expense 
during  the return on the pension plan s assets was negative due to the decline in the major stock markets 
our actuaries had assumed a positive return on the plan s assets for the market value of the assets of our employee pension plan is million at december   which is million less than the projected benefit obligation 
we do not anticipate a change in the market value of these assets which would have a significant effect on liquidity  capital resources  or results of operations 
during  funds provided by our operating activities amounted to million 
these funds  together with million provided by financing activities  were utilized to fund net investing activities of million 
funds provided by financing activities were primarily the result of growth in due to depositors of million and the issuance of common stock which raised million  partially offset by the redemption of preferred shares and common stock warrant of million and the net repayment of borrowings of million 
principal payments and calls on loans and securities provided additional funds 
our primary investment activity is the origination and purchase of loans  and the purchase of mortgage backed securities 
during  we had loan originations and purchases of million 
in addition during  we purchased million of mortgage backed and other securities 
at the time of the savings bank s conversion from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank  the savings bank was required by the ots to establish a liquidation account which is reduced as and to the extent that eligible account holders reduce their qualifying deposits 
the balance of the liquidation account at december  was million 
in the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of the savings bank  each eligible account holder will be entitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation account 
the savings bank is not permitted to declare or pay a dividend or to repurchase any of its capital stock if the effect would be to cause the savings bank s regulatory capital to be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account 
unlike the savings bank  f lushing financial corporation is not subject to ots regulatory restrictions on the declaration or payment of dividends to its stockholders  although the source of such dividends could depend upon dividend payments from the savings bank 
flushing financial corporation is subject  however  to the requirements of delaware law  which generally limit dividends to an amount equal to the excess of its net assets the amount by which total assets exceed total liabilities over its stated capital or  if there is no such excess  to its net profits for the current and or immediately preceding fiscal year 
regulatory capital position 
under applicable regulatory capital regulations  the banks are required to comply with each of three separate capital adequacy standards tangible capital  leverage and core capital and total risk based capital 
such classifications are used by the ots and other bank regulatory agencies to determine matters ranging from each institution s quarterly fdic deposit insurance premium assessments  to approvals of applications authorizing institutions to grow their asset size or otherwise expand business activities 
at december  and  each of the banks exceeded each of their three regulatory capital requirements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
participation in the us treasury s troubled asset relief program capital purchase program throughout the recessionary environment  we remained a profitable  well capitalized institution  so it was not without significant consideration that we elected to participate in the us treasury s capital purchase program 
on december   we issued  shares of the preferred stock with a liquidation preference value of  per share and a warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share to the treasury for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we did so because our historically strong ability to grow deposits and make quality loans enabled the savings bank to put this additional capital to good work 
common stock offering on september   we completed a public offering for  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
on october   the underwriters exercised their over allotment option to purchase an additional  common shares at per share 
the net proceeds of the offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were million 
redemption of preferred stock the common stock offering discussed above was a qualified equity offering 
as a result of this qualified equity offering  the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrant issued to the us treasury was reduced by one half 
on october   we redeemed the series b preferred stock for million plus all accrued and unpaid dividends 
on december   we repurchased the warrant for million 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are integral to understanding the results of operations and statement of financial condition 
these policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
several of these policies require management s judgment to determine the value of the company s assets and liabilities 
the company has established detailed written policies and control procedures to ensure consistent application of these policies 
the company has identified four accounting policies that require significant management valuation judgment the allowance for loan losses  fair value of financial instruments  goodwill impairment and income taxes 
allowance for loan losses 
an allowance for loan losses is provided to absorb probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by reviewing all impaired loans on an individual basis 
the remaining portfolio is evaluated based on the company s historical loss experience  recent trends in losses  collection policies and collection experience  trends in the volume of non performing loans  changes in the composition and volume of the gross loan portfolio  and local and national economic conditions 
judgment is required to determine how many years of historical loss experience are to be included when reviewing historical loss experience 
a full credit cycle must be used  or loss estimates may be inaccurate 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available 
notwithstanding the judgment required in assessing the components of the allowance for loan losses  the company believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the policy has been applied on a consistent basis for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
fair value of financial instruments 
the company carries certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards codification asc topic financial instruments and values those financial assets and financial liabilities in accordance with asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures 
asc topic defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  establis hes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
asc topic permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
management selected the fair value option for certain investment securities  primarily mortgage backed securities  and certain borrowings 
changes in the fair value of financial instruments for which the fair value election is made are recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
management selected  as of january   financial assets and financial liabilities with fair values of million and million  respectively  for the fair value option 
we elected to measure at fair value junior subordinated debt commonly known as trust preferred securities with a face amount of million that was issued during we also elected to measure at fair value securities that were purchased during and at a cost of million and million  respectively 
the securities portfolio also consists of mortgage backed and other securities for which the fair value election was not selected 
these securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position  with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
if any decline in fair value for these securities is deemed other than temporary  the security is written down to a new cost basis with the resulting loss recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
during and  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million and million  respectively  for certain pooled trust preferred securities  private label collateralized mortgage obligations  and preferred stocks 
financial assets and financial liabilities reported at fair value are required to be measured based on the following alternatives quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments level  significant other observable inputs level  or significant unobservable inputs level 
judgment is required in selecting the appropriate level to be used to determine fair value 
the majority of financial assets and financial liabilities for which the fair value election was made  and the majority of investments classified as available for sale  were measured using level inputs  which requires judgment to determine the fair value 
the trust preferred securities held in the investment portfolio  and the company s junior subordinated debentures  were measured using level inputs due to the inactive marke t for these securities 
the private label collateralized mortgage obligations for which other than temporary impairment charges were recorded in were valued using a level input 
the pooled trust preferred securities for which other than temporary impairment charges were recorded in were valued using a level input 
the preferred stocks for which other than temporary impairment charges were recorded in were valued using a level input 
goodwill impairment 
goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite life and is tested for impairment  rather than amortized  on at least an annual basis 
for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing  management has concluded that the company has one reporting unit 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  there is no impairment of goodwill 
however  if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  further evaluation is required to determine if a write down of goodwill is required 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are to be used as the basis for measurement  when available 
other acceptable valuation methods include an asset approach  which determines a fair value based upon the value of assets net of liabilities  an income approach  which determines fair value using one or more methods that convert anticipated economic benefits into a present single amount  and a market approach  which determines a fair value based on the similar businesses that have been sold 
the company conducts its annual impairment testing of goodwill as of december the impairment testing as of december  and did not show an impairment of goodwill based on the fair value of the company 
income taxes 
the company estimates its income taxes payable based on the amounts it expects to owe to the various taxing authorizes ie federal  state and local 
in estimating income taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the tax treatment of transactions  taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the company s tax position 
management also relies on tax opinions  recent audits  and historical experience 
the company also recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets that the company estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable  based on evidence available at the time the estimate is made 
these estimates can be affected by changes to tax laws  statutory tax rates  and future income levels 
contractual obligations payments due by period more less than than total year years years years in thousands borrowings deposits loan commitments capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations pension and other postretirement benefits deferred compensation plans total we have significant obligations that arise in the normal course of business 
we finance our assets with deposits and borrowings 
we also use borrowings to manage our interest rate risk 
we have the means to refinance these borrowings as they mature through financing arrangements with the fhlb ny and our ability to arrange repurchase agreements with broker dealers and the fhlb ny 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
we focus our balance sheet growth on the origination of mortgage loans 
at december   we had commitments to extend credit and lines of credit of million for mortgage and other loans 
these loans will be funded through principal and interest payments received on existing mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  growth in customer deposits  and  when necessary  additional borrowings 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
at december   the savings bank had fifteen branches  nine of which are leased  and the commercial bank utilized space within three of the savings bank s branch offices 
the savings bank leases its branch locations primarily when it is not the sole tenant 
whether the savings bank will purchase its future branch locations will depend in part on the availability of suitable locations and the availability of properties 
in addition  we lease our executive offices 
we currently outsource our data processing  loan servicing and check processing functions 
we believe that this is the most cost effective method for obtaining these services 
these arrangements are usually volume dependent and have varying terms 
the contracts for these services usually include annual increases based on the increase in the consumer price index 
the amounts shown above for purchase obligations represent the current term and volume of activity of these contracts 
we expect to renew these contracts as they expire 
the amounts shown for pension and other postretirement benefits reflect our employee and directors pension plans  the supplemental retirement benefits of our president  and amounts due under our plan for medical and life insurance benefits for retired employees 
the amount shown in the less than year column represents our current estimate for these benefits  some of which are based on information supplied by actuaries 
the amounts shown in columns reflecting periods over one year represent our current estimate based on the past year s actual disbursements and information supplied by actuaries 
the amounts do not include an increase for possible future retirees or increases in health plan costs 
the amount shown in the more than years column represents the amount required to increase the total amount to the projected benefit obligation of the directors plan and the medical and life insurance benefit plans  since these are unfunded plans and the underfunded portion of the employee pension plan 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
we currently provide a non qualified deferred compensation plan for officers who have achieved the level of at least senior vice president certain officers who had achieved the level of at least vice president are included in this plan under previously existing guidelines 
in addition to the amounts deferred by the officers  we match of their contributions  generally up to a maximum of of the officer s salary 
these plans generally require the deferred balance to be credited with earnings at a rate earned by certain mutual funds 
through december   employees could not receive a distribution from these plans until their employment is terminated 
the amounts shown in the columns for less than five years represent the estimate of the amounts we will contribute to a rabbi trust with respect to matching contributions under these plans  and the amounts to be paid from the rabbi trust to two executives who have retired 
the amount shown in the more than years column represents the current accrued liability for these plans  adjusted for the activity in the columns for less than five years 
this expense is provided in the consolidated statements of income  and the liability has been provided in the consolidated statements of financial condition
