item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with premierwest s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto as of december  and  and for each of the three years in the period ended december   that are included as pages f f in this report 
premierwest conducts a general commercial banking business  gathering deposits from the general public and applying those funds to the origination of loans for commercial  real estate  and consumer purposes and investments 
premierwest s profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated by interest earning assets principally loans and investments and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities principally customer deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the difference the interest rate spread between interest rates earned on interest earning assets and interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  and by the relative volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
financial institutions have traditionally used interest rate spreads as a measure of net interest income 
another indication of an institution s net interest income is its net yield on interest earning assets or net interest margin  which is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
to a lesser extent  premierwest s profitability is also affected by such factors as the level of non interest income and expenses and the provision for income taxes 
non interest income consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts and fees generated through premierwest s mortgage division and investment services subsidiary 
non interest expense consists primarily of salaries  commissions and employee benefits  professional fees  equipment expenses  occupancy related expenses  communications  advertising and other operating expenses 

table of contents financial highlights net loss available to common shareholders for was million  a  increase from net loss available to common shareholders of million 
our diluted earnings per common share were and for the years ended and  respectively 
this decline was primarily due to million in non cash write offs including a goodwill impairment  and million in a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
additionally  the company booked loan loss provision expense of million 
net interest income declined million primarily due to interest reversed and interest lost on loans on non accrual status 
return on average common shareholders equity was and return on average assets was for the year ended december  this compared with a return on average shareholders equity of and a return on average assets of for years ended december  dollars in thousands net income loss average assets return on average assets net income loss available to common shareholders average equity return on average equity available to common shareholders cash dividends declared net income loss payout ratio average equity average assets average equity to asset ratio gross loans outstanding declined million  or in and totaled billion at december  compared to billion at december  over the past year  our allowance for loan loss increased to million totaling of outstanding gross loans at december  the provision expense for loan losses was million for compared to million in management believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate as of december   based on our assessment of loan portfolio quality and our judgment of economic conditions that exist 
total deposits also grew to billion at december   an increase of million from billion at december  the increase was primarily a result of branch acquisitions in grass valley and davis  california in july non interest bearing demand deposits totaled million and accounted for of total deposits at year end compared to at december  the bank continues to aggressively pursue non interest bearing deposit relationships from consumers and businesses 
at december   the bank was below the well capitalized requirement for its total risk based capital ratio of  with a recorded ratio of 
the bank is now classified as adequately capitalized and may be subject to regulatory restrictions as discussed below 
during the second quarter of  federal and state bank regulators initiated their annual regulatory examination and completed the examination during the third quarter of as a result of the examination and capital levels  the bank expects to become subject to a formal regulatory agreement with the fdic 
in anticipation of any such regulatory action  our board of directors has initiated a rights offering  as discussed in 
table of contents note regulatory agreement  economic condition and management plan  to increase our risk based capital ratio to a level well above the regulatory minimum for well capitalized 
additionally  our board of directors has approved management s recommendations that the following steps be taken deferring further dividend payments on the preferred stock issued pursuant to the us treasury s capital purchase program on an interim basis to conserve capital  and deferring further interest payments on the company s trust preferred securities on an interim basis to conserve capital 
the oregon department of consumer and business services  which supervises banks and bank holding companies through its division of finance and corporate securities  and the federal reserve have policies that encourage banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends from current earnings  and have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by banks and bank holding companies  respectively 
we do not expect to be in a position to pay dividends on our common or preferred stock or interest payments on trust preferred securities without regulatory approval or until we are well capitalized and have satisfied conditions in any regulatory agreement or action 
any regulatory action related to the formal report associated with the bank s annual examination could subject the bank to mandatory restrictions including requirements to raise additional capital  reduce non performing asset totals  continue to restrict dividend payments  maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses  hire additional or new management  limit deposit pricing and limit access to brokered deposits or other wholesale funding sources 
our inability to comply with any aspect of the agreement could have an adverse impact on our ability to continue as a going concern 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates used  including the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  impairment of intangible assets  contingencies and litigation 
estimates are based upon historical experience  current economic conditions and other factors that management considers reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates result in judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities when these values are not readily available from other sources as well as assessing and identifying the accounting treatments of commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is established to absorb known and inherent losses attributable to loans outstanding 
the adequacy of the allowance is monitored on an ongoing basis and is based on management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and nonperforming trends  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience and other pertinent information 
as of december   approximately of premierwest s gross loan portfolio is secured by real estate 
accordingly  a significant decline in real estate values from current levels in oregon and california could cause management to increase the allowance for loan losses and or experience greater loan charge offs 
during the fourth quarter ended december   premierwest conducted an analysis  with the assistance of an independent consulting firm  and recorded goodwill impairment totaling million based on a detailed analysis valuing each element of the balance sheet 
annual and periodic analysis of the fair value of 
table of contents recorded goodwill for impairment involves a substantial amount of judgment  as does establishing and monitoring estimated lives of other amortizable intangible assets 
the company measures and recognizes as compensation expense  the grant date fair market value for all share based awards 
the company estimates the fair market value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to value its stock options 
the black scholes model requires the use of assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  the expected dividend yield  the weighted average expected life of the options and the historical volatility of its stock price 
the company establishes a deferred tax valuation allowance to reduce the net carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than not that all or some of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   the company determined that the deferred tax asset would not be realized  and the balance was reduced to zero 
in july  the company acquired two wachovia bank branches in northern california 
this acquisition included a core deposit intangible asset representing the value ascribed to the long term deposit relationships acquired and a negative cd premium as a result of the current all in cost of the cd portfolio being well above the cost of similar funding 
both of these intangible assets are being amortized over estimated weighted average useful lives of years and months  respectively 
the determination of our ability to fully utilize our deferred tax assets requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation of complex tax laws 
the company has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to fully recognize all of our deferred tax assets 
as such  we have written them down to the net realizable value 
prospectively  as the company continues to evaluate available evidence  including the depth of the current economic downturn and its implications on its operating results  it is possible that the company may deem some or all of its deferred income tax assets to be realizable 

table of contents results of operations average balances  interest rates and yields the following tables set forth certain information relating to premierwest s consolidated average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and reflect the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the years indicated 
the yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average daily balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods presented 
during the periods indicated  non accruing loans  if any  are included in the net loan category 
the yields and costs include fees  premiums and discounts  which are considered adjustments to yield

net interest income premierwest s profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated by interest earning assets principally loans and investments and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities principally customer deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the difference between rates of interest earned on interest earning assets and rates of interest paid on interest bearing liabilities the interest rate spread  as well as the relative volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
financial institutions have traditionally used interest rate spreads as a measure of net interest income 
another indication of an institution s net interest income is its net yield on interest earning assets or net interest margin  which is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis  before provisions for loan losses  for the year ended december   was million  a decrease of compared to tax equivalent net interest income of million in  which was an increase of compared to tax equivalent net interest income of million in the overall tax equivalent earning asset yield was in compared to in and in for the years  and  the cost of interest bearing liabilities was  and  respectively 
total interest earning assets averaged billion for the year ended december   compared to million for the corresponding period in the growth in earning assets was primarily the result of the expansion of our investment securities portfolio 
interest bearing liabilities averaged billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period in interest expense  as a percentage of average earning assets  decreased to in  compared to in and in average gross loans  which generally carry a higher yield than investment securities and other earning assets  comprised of average earning assets during  compared to in and in during the same periods  average yields on loans were in  in and in average investment securities comprised of average earning assets in  which was up from in and in tax equivalent interest yields on investment securities were for  for and in the short term interest rate environment  as measured by the prime lending rate  began to decline during the latter half of as actions to lower short term rates by the federal reserve resulted in a basis point reduction in the prime rate in the third quarter of  followed by an aggregate basis point reduction during the fourth quarter of during  the prime rate dropped basis points  including a basis point drop in the first four months of and a basis point drop during the last quarter of the year 
the rate has remained constant with no further reductions in as a result  our net interest spread decreased by basis points between and while declining basis points between and from a historical perspective  our balance sheet has been asset sensitive 
accordingly  a declining interest rate environment negatively impacts our net interest income absent increases in unchanged earning asset volumes or decreased interest expense 

table of contents rate volume analysis the following table provides an analysis of the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis indicating the impact of changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and of changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the values in this table reflect the extent to which changes in interest income and changes in interest expense are attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by the prior year rate and changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior year volume 
changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated to rate

the allowance is maintained at an amount believed to be sufficient to absorb losses in the loan portfolio and has two components one of which represents estimated loss reserves based on assigned credit risk ratings for our entire loan portfolio  and the other represents specifically established reserves for individually classified loans 
premierwest applies a systematic process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  including an internal loan review program and a quarterly analysis of the adequacy of the allowance 
the quarterly analysis includes determination of specific potential loss factors on individual classified loans  historical potential loss factors derived from actual net charge off experience and trends in nonperforming loans  and potential loss factors for other loan portfolio risks such as loan concentrations  the condition of the local economy  and the nature and volume of loans 
the allowance for loan losses correlates to management s judgment of the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
factors considered in establishing an appropriate allowance include a careful assessment of the financial condition of the borrower  a realistic determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral  the condition of the local economy and the condition of the specific industry of the borrower  a comprehensive analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories  an assessment of pending legal action for collection of loans and related guarantees  and  a review of delinquent and classified loans 
although management believes the loan loss provision has been sufficient to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses  there can be no assurance that actual loan losses will not require significant additional charges to operations in the future 

table of contents for the year ended december   the loan loss provision totaled million compared to million for  and  for this represents an increase of between and and an increase of  between and during  the bank continued to increased its allowance for loan losses in response to credit issues experienced with a number of our borrowers  particularly those relying on stable real estate values as an integral component of their individual business strategies 
during  there was a million increase in oreo due to the continued decline in economic activity and an increase in problem credits 
the breadth of the falloff in economic activity was felt throughout the geographic regions in which we conduct our business 
in response  management focused additional resources to proactively deal with credit relationships that showed indications of strain  and sought and obtained independent validation of our internal evaluations of real estate collateral dependent loans 
management has progressively enhanced the company s loan policies and procedures to adjust to the rapidly evolving economic and credit environment  conducted an ongoing and comprehensive analysis of loan portfolio quality  increased the number of credit administration to oversee the consistent application and adherence to established loan policies and procedures and provided training to all lending personnel 
a more detailed review of the loan loss provision is presented in the table on page loan charge offs refer to the recorded values of loans actually removed from the consolidated balance sheet and  after netting out recoveries on previously charged off loans  become net charge offs 
premierwest s policy is to charge off loans when  in management s opinion  the loan or a portion thereof is deemed uncollectible  although concerted efforts are made to maximize recovery after the charge off 
management continues to closely monitor the loan quality of new and existing relationships through detailed review and evaluation procedures and by integrating loan officers into such activities 
for the years ended december  and december   loan charge offs exceeded recoveries by million and  respectively 
a more detailed review of charge offs and recoveries are presented in the table on page non interest income non interest income is primarily comprised of service charges on deposit accounts  mortgage origination fees  investment brokerage and annuity fees  other commissions and fees  and other non interest income including gains on sales of investment securities 
deposit account related service charges and fees for other banking services have grown consistently over the past three years as a result of the bank s internal growth and also from increases made in our fee schedule for banking services 
during  non interest income increased from million in to million  an increase of million or 
the increase from the previous year was primarily related to increases in other fee income 
during  non interest income increased from million in to million  an increase of million or 
overall  deposit service charge income increased million  other commissions and fees increased  and other non interest income increased  the increases in total non interest income were offset by a decline in mortgage origination income of  and a decline in investment brokerage and annuity fees of  in general  management prices the bank s deposit accounts at rates competitive with those offered by other commercial banks in its market area 
deposit and deposit fee growth have been generated by branch expansion  offering competitive deposit products  cultivating strong customer relationships through competitively superior service and cross selling deposit products to loan customers 
non interest expense non interest expenses consist principally of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  communication expenses  professional fees  advertising and other expenses 

table of contents during  non interest expense increased million or from million in to million in increased expenses were primarily driven by the one time non cash goodwill impairment expense of million 
other increases in non interest expense included fdic and state assessments increasing million or  salaries and employee benefits increasing million or  professional fees increasing  or and net other real estate owned oreo expense increasing  or 
during  non interest expense increased million or from million in to million in increased expenses were primarily associated with the acquired operations of stockmans financial group 
increases in non interest expense were primarily related to salaries and employee benefits increasing million or 
in addition  communications increased  or  net occupancy expense increased million or  professional fees increased of  or  and advertising expenditures increased  or 
related party transactions certain officers and directors and the companies with which they are associated are customers of  and have had banking transactions with  the bank in the ordinary course of business 
in addition  the bank expects to continue to have such banking transactions in the future 
all loans  and commitments to lend  to such parties are generally made on the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons 
in the opinion of management  these transactions do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present any other unfavorable features 
provision for income taxes the year over year decline in premierwest s taxable income resulted in an effective tax rate of  or a million tax benefit in federal and state income taxes for this compares to effective tax rates of for and for the decrease in the effective tax rate is the result of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance offset by the net deferred tax asset 
the determination of our ability to fully utilize our deferred tax assets requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation of complex tax laws 
the company has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to fully recognize all of our deferred tax assets 
as such  we have written them down to the net realizable value 
prospectively  as the company continues to evaluate available evidence  including the depth of the current economic downturn and its implications on its operating results  it is possible that the company may deem some or all of its deferred income tax assets to be realizable 
efficiency ratio banks use the term efficiency ratio to describe the relationship of administrative and other costs associated with generating revenues to certain elements of income  a concept similar to a measurement of overhead 
the efficiency ratio is computed by dividing non interest expense by the sum of net interest income plus non interest income 
management views the efficiency ratio as a measure of premierwest s ability to control non interest expenses 
expenses related to non cash goodwill impairment  an increase in fdic assessments and a decrease in loan fee income and interest resulted in an increase in our efficiency ratio to a level in excess of our target 
for the year ended december   our efficiency ratio was as compared to  and in and  respectively 
our efficiency ratio without the goodwill impairment would have been 
generally  lower efficiency ratios reflect greater cost containment  however  the success of premierwest s community banking strategy necessitates a balance between heightened expense control and the need to maintain high levels of customer service and effective risk management 
accordingly  premierwest staffs its branches in a manner to support its high standards for delivering exceptional customer service and maintains the necessary 
table of contents administrative personnel to support the desired customer service while maintaining effective risk management through internal control functions such as credit administration  internal audit and compliance

all securities related investment activity is reported to the board of directors 
board review is required for significant changes in investment strategy 
certain senior executives have the authority to purchase and sell securities for our portfolio in accordance with premierwest s funds management policy 
management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase 
if management has the intent and premierwest has the ability at the time of purchase to hold a security until maturity or on a long term basis  the security is classified as held to maturity and is reflected on the balance sheet at historical cost 
securities to be held for indefinite periods and not intended to be held to maturity or on a long term basis are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are reflected on the balance sheet at their estimated fair market value 
an outside broker service provides the fair market value for the available for sale securities using level inputs that are fair values for investment securities based on quoted market prices or the market values for comparable securities

table of contents during  we purchased million in additional securities as we invested cash related to the acquisition of branches in davis and grass valley  california  in july during the same year  million in securities matured  were called  sold or were paid down 
this compares to sales  maturities and or calls of investment securities of million in  and million in during  we reported realized gains of  no security sales were reported during and at december  premierwest s investment portfolio had total net unrealized gains of approximately million 
this compares to net unrealized losses of approximately  at december   and  at december  unrealized gains and losses reflect the impact of security values from changes in market interest rates and do not represent the amount of actual profits or losses that may be recognized by the bank 
actual realized gains and losses occur at the time investment securities are sold or called 
because the decline in fair value is attributable to the changes in interest rates and not credit quality  and because the bank does not intend to sell the securities in this class and it is not likely that the bank will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases  which may include holding each security until maturity  the unrealized losses on these investments are not considered other than temporarily impaired 
securities may be pledged from time to time to secure public deposits  secure excess deposit coverage for customers  fhlb borrowings  repurchase agreement deposit accounts  or for other purposes as required or permitted by law 
at december   securities with a market value of million were pledged for such purposes 
as of december   premierwest also held  shares of par value federal home loan bank of seattle fhlb stock  which is a restricted equity security 
fhlb stock represents an equity interest in the fhlb  but it does not have a readily determinable market value 
the stock can be sold at its par value only  and only to the fhlb or to another member institution 
member institutions are required to maintain a minimum stock investment in the fhlb based on specific percentages of their outstanding mortgages  total assets or fhlb advances

loan portfolio the most significant asset on our balance sheet in terms of risk and the effect on our earnings is our loan portfolio 
on our balance sheet  the term net loans refers to total loans outstanding  at their principal balance outstanding  net of the allowance for loan losses and deferred loan fees 
premierwest s loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing our lending operations 
generally  the guidelines address the types of loans that we seek  loan concentrations  our target markets  underwriting and collateral requirements  terms  interest rate and yield considerations  and compliance with laws and regulations 
all loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and limitations as to amounts 
these limitations apply to the borrower s total outstanding indebtedness to the bank  including the indebtedness of the borrower in a guarantor capacity 
the policies are reviewed and approved by the board of directors of premierwest on a routine basis 

table of contents bank officers are charged with loan origination in compliance with underwriting standards overseen by the credit administration department and in conformity with established loan policies 
on an as needed but not less than annual basis  the board of directors determines the lending authority of the bank s loan officers 
such delegated authority may include authority related to loans  letters of credit  overdrafts  uncollected funds  and such other authority as determined by the board  the president and chief executive officer  or chief credit officer within their own delegated authority 
the chief credit officer has the authority to approve loans up to a million lending limit as set by the board of directors 
all loans above the lending limit of the chief credit officer  and up to million limit  may be approved jointly by the chief credit officer along with one of the following chairman of premierwest bank  president and chief executive officer or the chief banking officer 
loans that exceed this limit are subject to the review and approval by the board s loan committee

unfunded loan commitments were million as of december   representing a decrease of million from total unfunded loan commitments at december  for a more detailed discussion of off balance sheet arrangements  see note to the financial statements included in this report starting on page f as indicated above  the company s loan portfolio is and has been concentrated in commercial real estate loans during recent years  a common characteristic among community banks due to focused lending for business and consumer needs in communities within the bank s market area 
some commercial loans are secured by real estate  but funds are used for purposes other than financing the purchase of real property  such as inventory financing and equipment purchases  where real property serves as collateral for the loan 
loans of this type are characterized as real estate loans because of the real estate collateral 
since  management has taken actions in an attempt to reduce higher risk commercial real estate loan volume by directing efforts away from new commercial real estate loan production and by reducing related concentration 
however  the volume of commercial real estate loans remains above what management would otherwise target  particularly in light of current conditions 
economic circumstances have produced significant reductions in real estate values  and the slowdown has resulted in business failures that have adversely affected commercial real estate activities 
consequently  management actively pursues additional credit support and

table of contents credit quality management is committed to a credit culture that emphasizes quality underwriting standards and provides for the effective monitoring of loan quality and aggressive resolution to problem loans once they are identified 
nonperforming assets amounted to of total assets outstanding at december   up from at december   and are primarily a result of the continued economic disruption that began during interest income that would have been recognized on non accrual loans if such loans had performed in accordance with their contractual terms totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  actual interest income recognized on such loans on a cash basis during was approximately   and  in and at december  and  the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans was million and million  respectively 
the following table summarizes nonperforming assets by category december  dollars in thousands loans on nonaccrual status loans past due greater than days but not on nonaccrual status impaired loans in process of collection other real estate owned and foreclosed assets total nonperforming assets percentage of nonperforming assets to total assets total nonperforming assets were million at december   up from million as of december  the nonperforming asset total includes million in other real estate owned as of december  as compared to at the previous year end 
while the bank significantly increased its resources dedicated to dealing with nonperforming assets in  continued deterioration in appraised values  as a result of the illiquid market for some property types  resulted in lower collateral appraisal values 
while the bank may believe the value at which the loan is ultimately resolved may be higher  regulatory guidance and current practice is to value all non performing assets at current appraised value without regard to other factors or documentation 
the results from these policies have frequently resulted in charges against earnings 
management continues to work closely with borrowers who are motivated to resolve their financial issues through properly collateralized restructures and workouts 
in addition  the team is proactive in contacting distressed asset investors in anticipation of soliciting interest in acquiring notes or foreclosed property 
the holding costs of certain other real estate owned are being reviewed as current volatile market conditions may warrant holding some foreclosed assets for future gains 
with shareholder value in mind  our team will continue to evaluate these assets and act accordingly 
nonperforming loans management considers a loan to be nonperforming when it is days or more past due  or sooner if the bank has determined that repayment of the loan in full is unlikely 
generally  unless collateral for a loan is a one to four family residential dwelling  interest accrual ceases when days past due but no later than the date of acquisition by foreclosure  voluntary deed or other means and the loan is classified as nonperforming 
a loan placed on non accrual status may or may not be contractually past due at the time the determination is made to 
table of contents place the loan on non accrual status  and it may or may not be secured 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  it is the bank s policy to reverse interest previously accrued but uncollected 
interest later collected on the non accrual loan  for book purposes  is credited to loan principal if  in management s opinion  full collectability of principal is doubtful 
in some instances where the loans are well secured and in the process of collection  such loans will not be placed on non accrual status 
in addition  loans that are impaired pursuant to asc  accounting by creditors for the impairment of a loan  are classified as non accrual consistent with regulatory guidance 
loans placed on non accrual status typically remain so until all principal and interest payments are brought current  and the potential for future payments  in accordance with associated loan agreements  appears reasonably certain 
impaired loans are defined as loans where full recovery of contractual principal and interest is in doubt 
impaired loans include all non accrual and restructured commercial and real estate loans 
the dollar amount of loan impairment is determined using either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the collateral of an impaired collateral dependent loan or an observable market price 
current practice and regulatory guidance places primary emphasis on appraised value for collateral dependent loans 
loan impairment is typically recognized through a charge to earnings reflecting any shortfall between the principal balance owing and the net realizable value of the loan 
at december  and  nonperforming loans loans days or more delinquent and or on non accrual status totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the large dollar increase in nonperforming loans between and is concentrated primarily in real estate collateralized loans  and is primarily comprised of construction and commercial real estate credits 
management has assessed the real estate collateral for impairment and charged off any impairment on real estate collateral dependent loans 
on all other real estate collateralized loans  management believes that  based on current appraisals or estimates based on the most recent available appraisals aggressively discounted for aging  adequate collateral coverage existed as of each year end

table of contents the company s principal source of credit stress is real estate related loans  both commercial and residential real estate 
borrowers either involved in real estate or having secured loans with real estate have been vulnerable to both the ongoing economic downturn and to declining real estate collateral values 
approximately or million of our non performing loan total of million is directly related to real estate in the form of commercial or residential real estate loans 
at december   million of our real estate related loans remain current as to contractual principal and interest payments  but were placed on non accrual status due to the absence of evidence supporting the borrowers ongoing ability to discharge their loan obligations 
continuing actions taken to address the troubled credit situation include escalation of credit monitoring activities since the beginning of the fourth quarter of to provide early warning of possible borrower distress that could lead to loan payment defaults 
enhanced credit monitoring and early warnings are intended to provide additional time to seek viable alternatives with the borrower 
for those borrowers who have experienced payment problems and wish to seek a workable arrangement with the company  management and staff are actively involved in seeking loan restructuring and other loan modification options and obtaining additional collateral coverage 
more recently during the quarter ended september   the company reorganized and assigned an asset recovery group arg to interface both directly with borrowers and with line managers to expedite resolution of existing and potential troubled credits 
as of december   the arg had staff members 
we believe that these actions have and will continue to facilitate recovery strategies with cooperative borrowers 
in those instances where alternatives have been exhausted or determined to be impractical and default under the terms of the loans has occurred  foreclosure actions are pursued 
evaluation to confirm the reliability of our internal credit reviews was completed on a significant portion of our loan portfolio during by the independent firm that had previously conducted a similar review of our acquisition and development portfolio during the fourth quarter of management engaged this independent firm to perform quarterly reviews during the quarterly review reports were issued in the third and fourth quarters of active involvement by senior management has added emphasis to actively guide activities related to resolution of non performing asset issues 
a continued decline in economic conditions in our market areas and nationally  as well as other factors  could adversely impact individual borrowers or our loan portfolio in general 
as a result  we can provide no assurance that additional loans will not become days or more past due  become impaired or be placed on non accrual status  restructured or transferred to other real estate owned in the future 
additional information regarding our loan portfolio is provided in note of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements

when property is acquired in this manner  it is recorded at the lower of cost the unpaid principal balance at the date of acquisition or net realizable value fair value less estimated selling costs 
any further write down is charged to expense 
all costs incurred from the date of acquisition to maintain the property are expensed as incurred 
oreo is appraised during the foreclosure process  before acquisition and losses are recognized against the allowance for loan losses in the amount by which the cost value of the related loan exceeds the estimated net realizable value of the property acquired 
subsequent write downs or losses  net of gains  on sale of oreo are recorded as non interest expense 
during  the company acquired collateral as a part of two loan settlements 
the collateral included real estate  which was transferred to oreo  a partially completed potable water system including easements  facilities and equipment and an operating senior care facility  both of which are included in the oreo total on the balance sheet at million and million  respectively 
the company is making capital improvements to complete the water system and upgrade the care facility to place both in condition suitable for sale

the allowance for loan losses is increased through periodic charges to earnings through provision for loan losses and represents the aggregate amount  net of loans charged off and recoveries on previously charged off loans  that is needed to establish an appropriate reserve for credit losses 
the allowance is estimated based on a variety of factors and using a methodology as described below the company classifies loans into relatively homogeneous pools by loan type in accordance with regulatory guidelines for regulatory reporting purposes 
the company regularly reviews all loans within each loan category to establish risk ratings for them that include pass  watch  special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
pursuant to asc  the impaired portion of collateral dependent loans is charged off 
other risk related loans not considered impaired have loss factors applied to the various loan pool balances to establish loss potential for provisioning purposes 
analyses are performed to establish the loss factors based on historical experience as well as expected losses based on qualitative evaluations of such factors as the economic trends and conditions  industry conditions  levels and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans  levels and trends in charge offs and recoveries  among others 
the loss factors are applied to loan category pools segregated by risk classification to estimate the loss inherent in the company s loan portfolio pursuant to accounting for contingencies asc 
table of contents additionally  impaired loans are evaluated for loss potential on an individual basis in accordance with accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan asc  and specific reserves are established based on thorough analysis of collateral values where loss potential exists 
when an impaired loan is collateral dependent and a deficiency exists in the fair value of real estate collateralizing the loan in comparison to the associated loan balance  the deficiency is charged off at that time 
impaired loans are reviewed no less frequently than quarterly 
in the event that a current appraisal to support the fair value of the real estate collateral underlying an impaired loan has not yet been received  but the company believes that the collateral value is insufficient to support the loan amount  an impairment reserve is recorded 
in these instances  the receipt of a current appraisal triggers an updated review of the collateral support for the loan and any deficiency is charged off or reserved at that time 
in those instances where a current appraisal is not available in a timely manner in relation to a financial reporting cut off date  the company discounts the most recent third party appraisal depending on a number of factors including  but not limited to  property location  local price volatility  local economic conditions  recent comparable sales  etc 
in all cases  the costs to sell the subject property are deducted in arriving at the net realizable value of the collateral 
any unpaid property taxes or similar expenses also reduce the net realizable value of collateral 
the table below summarizes the asc defined substandard loan totals  the asc defined impaired loan totals collectively  adversely classified loans  and other related data at quarter end since december  december  september  june  march  december  dollars in thousands rated substandard impaired total adversely classified loans gross loans adversely classified loans to gross loans adversely classified loans are defined as loans having a well defined weakness or weaknesses related to the borrower s financial capacity or to pledged collateral that may jeopardize the repayment of the debt 
they are characterized by the possibility that the bank may sustain some loss if the deficiencies giving rise to the substandard classification are not corrected 
note that any loans internally rated worse than substandard are included in the impaired loan totals 
as illustrated above  during the second quarter of  the company experienced a substantial increase in adversely classified loans 
reserves as a percentage of both categories of loans have also increased from at december  to at december  the impact of the extended economic downturn is shown in the increase in loans rated substandard and impaired  although data from the most recent two quarters shows some reduction in the overall increasing trend 
in addition  the very recent loss activity of the company has significantly increased the historical loss components of the loss factors being used in the allowance methodology 
qualitative loss factors have increased as well since year end  however  the historical loss component changes alone have resulted in a material increase to the allowance from december  to december  in some instances the company has modified or restructured loans to amend the interest rate and or to extend the maturity 
through december   any such amendments have generally been consistent with the terms of newly booked loans reflecting current standards for amortization and interest rate and do not represent concessions to such borrowers

the amount reclassified represents the off balance sheet credit exposure related to unfunded commitments to lend and letters of credit  and a  increase resulting from the purchase of a consumer finance loan portfolio on june  the following table shows the allocation of premierwest s allowance for loan losses by category and the percent of loans in each category to gross loans at the dates indicated 
premierwest allocates its allowance for loan losses to each loan classification based on relative risk characteristics 
general  specific and qualitative allocations are made based on estimated losses that are due to current credit circumstances and other available 
table of contents information for each loan category 
general allocations are based on historical loss factors 
specific allocations are related to loans on non accrual status  estimated reserves based on individual credit risk ratings  loans for which management believes the borrower might be unable to comply with loan repayment terms  even though the loans are not in non accrual status  and  loans for which supporting collateral might not be adequate to recover loan amounts if foreclosure and subsequent sale of collateral become necessary 
qualitative allocations include adjustments for economic conditions  concentrations and other subjective factors  and are intended to compensate for the subjective nature of the determination of losses inherent in the overall loan portfolio 
because the total loan loss allowance is a valuation reserve applicable to the entire loan portfolio  the portion of the allowance allocated to each loan category does not necessarily represent the actual losses that may occur within that loan category

a further slowing in the oregon and or california economies  further declines in real estate values or increased unemployment could result in increased levels of nonperforming assets and charge offs  increased loan loss provisions and reductions in income 
as of december   management believes that the company s total allowance for credit losses and its reserve for off balance sheet commitments are sufficient to absorb the losses inherent in the loan portfolio  related both to funded loans and unfunded commitments 
this assessment  based on both historical levels of net charge offs and continuing detailed reviews of the quality of the loan portfolio and current business  economic and regulatory conditions  involves uncertainty and judgment 
as a result  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments cannot be determined with inherent accuracy and may change in future periods 
additionally  bank regulatory authorities may require additional charges to the provision for loan losses as a result of their periodic examinations of the company and their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
if actual circumstances and losses differ substantially from management s assumptions and estimates  the allowance for loan losses might not be sufficient to absorb all future losses 
net earnings would be adversely affected if that were to occur

premierwest has adopted policies to maintain an adequately liquid position to enable it to respond to changes in the financial environment and ensure sufficient funds are available to meet customers needs for borrowing and deposit withdrawals 
generally  premierwest s major sources of liquidity are customer deposits  sales and maturities of investment securities  the use of borrowings from the fhlb and correspondent banks and net cash provided by operating activities 
as of december   unused and available lines of credit totaled million of which million was available from fhlb s cash management advance program and million from a correspondent bank 
scheduled loan repayments are a historically stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan prepayments are not as stable because they are influenced by general interest rate levels  competing interest rates available on other investments  market competition  economic conditions and other factors 
liquid asset balances include cash  amounts due from other banks  federal funds sold  and investment securities available for sale 
at december   these liquid assets totaled million  or of total assets  as compared to million  or of total assets  at december  our liquidity and access to interbank credit availability remains somewhat limited due to counterparty credit concerns over the company s financial performance during the wachovia branch acquisition in july added million to our deposit base and improved liquidity which remains evident in our year end cash and cash equivalent balances 
deposits remain our preferred source of funding 
our securities portfolio has expanded significantly during but remains largely committed to satisfying pledging requirements for collateralizing public funds deposits that exceed the fdic insurance limits 
a highly competitive marketplace for local deposits will result in a continuing focus on strategies to grow the bank s core deposit base to assure primary liquidity 
the bank maintains contingency plans to address its liquidity needs including collateralized borrowing capacity through the federal home loan bank  other correspondent banks and the federal reserve bank of san francisco and to support its funding needs that are not covered by our core deposit base 
management has also elected to pursue raising additional equity see note regulatory agreement  economic condition and management plan and to emphasize strategies for building relationship oriented core deposits over time rather than aggressively attracting higher cost transactional time deposits from within our local markets

table of contents at december   premierwest had outstanding unfunded lending commitments of million 
nearly all of these commitments represented unused portions of credit lines available to businesses 
many of these credit lines are not expected to be fully drawn upon and  accordingly  the aggregate commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
management believes that premierwest s sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet likely calls on outstanding commitments  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
the federal reserve board and the federal deposit insurance corporation have established minimum requirements for capital adequacy for financial holding companies and member banks

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk like other financial institutions  premierwest is subject to interest rate risk 
interest earning assets could mature or re price more rapidly than  or on a different basis from  interest bearing liabilities primarily borrowings and deposits with short and medium term maturities in a period of declining interest rates 
although having assets that mature or re price more frequently on average than liabilities will be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  such an asset liability structure will result in lower net interest income during periods of declining interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity  or interest rate risk  relates to the effect of changing interest rates on net interest income 

table of contents interest earning assets with interest rates tied to the prime rate for example  or that mature in relatively short periods of time  are considered interest rate sensitive 
also impacting interest rate sensitivity are loans that are subject to a rate floor 
interest bearing liabilities with interest rates that can be re priced in a discretionary manner  or that mature in relatively short periods of time  are also considered interest rate sensitive 
the differences between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities over various time horizons are commonly referred to as sensitivity gaps 
as interest rates change  the sensitivity gap will have either a favorable or adverse effect on net interest income 
a negative gap with liabilities re pricing more rapidly than assets generally should have a favorable effect when interest rates are falling  and an adverse effect when rates are rising 
a positive gap with assets re pricing more rapidly than liabilities generally should have an adverse effect when rates are falling  and a favorable effect when rates are rising 
the following table illustrates the maturities or re pricing of premierwest s assets and liabilities as of december   based upon the contractual maturity or contractual re pricing dates of loans excluding nonperforming loans and the contractual maturities of time deposits and borrowings 
prepayment assumptions have not been applied to fixed rate mortgage loans 
demand loans  loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity  and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less 
by repricing interval months months years over years total dollars in thousands assets interest earning assets federal funds sold and interest earning deposits investment securities loans  net total liabilities interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand and savings time deposits borrowings junior subordinated debentures total interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative cumulative gap as a of interest earning assets for purposes of the gap analysis  loans are reduced by the allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans 
unearned discounts and deferred loan fees are included 
this analysis of interest rate sensitivity has a number of limitations 
the gap analysis above is based upon assumptions concerning such matters as when assets and liabilities will re price in a changing interest rate environment 
because these assumptions are no more than estimates  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or re pricing within a stated period might actually mature or re price at different times and at different volumes from those estimated 
the actual prepayments and withdrawals after a change in interest rates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the data shown in the table 
certain assets  adjustable rate loans for example  commonly have provisions that limit changes in interest rates each time the interest rate 
table of contents changes and on a cumulative basis over the life of the loan 
also  the renewal or re pricing of certain assets and liabilities can be discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debt could diminish after an interest rate increase 
therefore  the gap table above does not and cannot necessarily indicate the actual future impact of general interest movements on net interest income 
in addition to a static gap analysis of interest rate sensitivity  premierwest also attempts to monitor interest rate risk from the perspective of changes in the economic value of equity  also referred to as net portfolio value npv  and changes in net interest income 
changes to the npv and net interest income are simulated using instant and permanent rate shocks of plus and minus basis points  in increments of basis points 
these results are then compared to prior periods to determine the effect of previously implemented strategies 
if estimated changes to npv or net interest income are not within acceptable limits  the board may direct management to adjust its asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within acceptable limits 
the npv calculations are based on the net present value of discounted cash flows  using market prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest for each asset and liability product type based on its characteristics 
the theoretical projected change in npv and net interest income over a month period under each of the instantaneous and permanent rate shocks have been calculated by premierwest using computer simulation 
premierwest s simulation analysis forecasts net interest income and earnings given unchanged interest rates stable rate scenario 
the model then estimates a percentage change from the stable rate scenario under scenarios of rising and falling market interest rates over various time horizons 
the simulation model  based on december  data  estimates that if an immediate decline of basis points occurs  net interest income during the subsequent twelve months could be unfavorably affected by approximately  while a similar immediate increase in interest rates would result in a favorable change of approximately indicative of an asset sensitive position for the twelve months ending december  because of uncertainties about customer behavior  refinance activity  absolute and relative loan and deposit pricing levels  competitor pricing and market behavior  product volumes and mix  and other unexpected changes in economic events affecting movements and volatility in market rates  there can be no assurance that simulation results are reliable indicators of earnings under such conditions 
net increase decrease in net interest income in thousands net interest margin change in return on equity as of december   the prime rate was prime rate increase of basis points to basis points to basis points to prime rate decrease of basis points to basis points to basis points to premierwest s interest rate sensitivity gap is asset sensitive  which in conjunction with the general level of interest rates  yields abnormal changes in net interest income as further rate declines are modeled 
this occurs due to a practical floor of zero for deposit interest rates 
tax adjusted at a rate 
it is premierwest s policy to manage interest rate risk to maximize long term profitability under the range of likely interest rate scenarios
