item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
you should review the risk factors section of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements described in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are an advanced electronic materials provider that develops  manufactures and sells monocrystalline sapphire and other innovative crystalline products for leds  rfics  blue laser diodes  optoelectronics and other optical applications 
the emergence of sapphire in commercial volumes at competitive prices has enabled the development of new technologies such as hb white  blue and green leds and highly integrated rfics 
we apply our proprietary crystal growth technology to produce high quality sapphire products efficiently to supply our end markets  and we work closely with our customers to meet their quality and delivery needs 
we are a vertically integrated manufacturer of high quality sapphire substrates and optical windows that are used in a variety of high growth  high volume end market applications 
our largest product line is two to four inch sapphire cores and wafers for use in leds and blue laser diodes for solid state lighting and electronic applications 
in addition  we sell six inch sapphire wafers that are used for sos rfics  as well as products for military  aerospace  sensor and other applications 
we have also extended our technology  which gives us the ability to produce cores and wafers of up to twelve inches in diameter to support next generation led and sos rfic production 
we currently sell six and eight inch wafers to led chip manufacturers for their research and development efforts toward moving production on to these larger diameter substrates 
we have also developed the ability to produce large diameter circular and rectangular sapphire windows for use in various optical window applications 
our revenue in the fourth quarter of and through most of was significantly impacted by the global recession 
much of the sapphire we sell into the marketplace goes into led lighting for consumer electronics 
consumer spending on these products declined during the recession  which decreased demand for our products 
toward the end of  demand for sapphire began to strengthen as consumers resumed spending on consumer electronics  driven  in part  by the introduction of new products such as led backlit lcd televisions 
in addition  general lighting applications for leds continued to expand 
we expect demand for sapphire to remain strong throughout we sell our products on a global basis 
the asian  north american and european markets accounted for  and  respectively  of our revenue for the year ended december    and  respectively  for the year ended december  and  and  respectively  for the year ended december  revenue declined in all markets in primarily due to the recession 
in addition  our north american revenue in was impacted by lower orders in the period from our key customer in the sos rfic market due to a build up of inventory at that customer 
we currently depend on a small number of suppliers for certain raw materials  components  services and equipment  including key materials such as aluminum oxide and certain furnace components 
if the supply of these components were to be disrupted or terminated  or if these suppliers were unable to supply the quantities of raw materials required  we may have difficulty in finding or may be unable to find alternative sources for these items 
as a result  we may be unable to meet the demand for our products  which could have a material adverse impact on us 
we provide direct sales from our franklin park  illinois offices 
additionally  we use an independent commission based sales representative in china to assist in supporting our customers in that country 
customers 
table of contents in china place orders directly with us 
substantially all of our revenue is generated by our direct sales force and we expect this to continue in the future 
we manufacture and ship our products from our facilities in the chicago metropolitan area 
we have approximately  square feet of manufacturing and office space 
we are currently building a  square foot facility in penang  malaysia  which will process sapphire grown by us in our illinois facilities into finished cores and wafers 
we anticipate this facility to open in the fall of we also plan to acquire a  square foot building in illinois in to expand our crystal growth operations 
we anticipate this facility will begin operations in the winter of financial operations revenue 
our revenue consists of sales of sapphire materials sold in core  as cut  as ground and polished forms in two  three  four  six and eight inch diameters as well as optical materials sold as blanks or polished windows 
products are made to varying specifications  such as crystal planar orientations and thicknesses 
we have focused on increasing sales of larger diameter substrates  which we define as three inch or greater in diameter  as they generally yield higher gross margins 
sales decreased across all product lines for year ended december   due primarily to the global recession 
demand began to improve in the second half of and we anticipate strong demand for sapphire through average selling prices for our products declined significantly in late and early due to weak demand 
however  with demand strengthening in late  we began raising prices and we believe pricing will continue to increase in  although it is difficult to predict the magnitude and timing of further price increases 
historically  a significant portion of our revenue has been derived from sales to relatively few customers 
for the year ended december   we had three customers that accounted for approximately   and of our revenue 
for the year ended december   we had four customers that accounted for approximately   and of our revenue 
for the year ended december   we had three customers that accounted for approximately   and of our revenue 
other than as discussed above  none of our customers accounted for more than of our revenue for such periods 
although we are attempting to diversify and expand our customer base  we expect our revenue to continue to be concentrated among a small number of customers 
we expect that our significant customers may change from period to period 
we recognize revenue upon shipment to our customers 
delays in product orders or changes to the timing of shipments could cause our quarterly revenue to vary significantly 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from customers outside of the us 
the majority of our sales are to the asian market and we expect that region to continue to be a major source of revenue for us 
all of our revenue and corresponding accounts receivable are denominated in us dollars 
research and development revenue is recognized as services are performed 
we execute agreements with our customers that clearly describe the scope of the project  the services we will provide  ownership of any tangible or intangible assets generated as part of the project  and the amount of consideration we will receive 
cost of goods sold 
our cost of goods sold consists primarily of manufacturing materials  labor  manufacturing related overhead such as utilities  depreciation and rent  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory reserves  freight and warranties 
we manufacture our products at our franklin park  illinois and bensenville  illinois manufacturing facilities based on customer orders 
we purchase materials and supplies to support such demand 
we are subject to variations in the cost of raw materials and consumables from period to period because we do not have long term fixed price agreements with our suppliers 
for the years ended december   and  utility costs represented approximately  and  of our cost of goods sold  respectively 
our existing manufacturing facilities are covered under an agreement that locks in electricity prices in at current levels through december  once our current agreement expires  if electricity prices increase significantly  we may not be able to pass these price increases through to our customers 
table of contents on a timely basis  if at all  which could adversely affect our gross margins and results of operations 
in addition  there can be no guarantee that the electricity rates that we negotiate for our new manufacturing facilities will be comparable in cost to our existing agreement 
gross profit 
our gross profit began decreasing in the second half of and we realized a gross loss for the full year due to underutilization of our facilities and staff as well as a decline in average selling prices of our products as a result of the worldwide economic downturn 
with the return of demand for sapphire and the resulting increase in average selling prices in late  we returned to a gross profit in the fourth quarter of we expect average selling prices to continue to increase in  which would further improve gross profit 
our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including average sales prices of our products  product mix  our ability to reduce manufacturing costs and fluctuations in the cost of electricity  raw materials and other supplies 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses g a consist primarily of salaries and associated costs for employees in finance  human resources  information technology and administrative activities  charges for outside accounting  legal  insurance fees and stock based compensation 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and associated costs for employees engaged in sales activities  commissions paid to third party representatives  product samples  charges for participation in trade shows and travel 
we expect these expenses to increase in future periods based on planned additions to sales staff and travel to expand our customer base 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses include costs related to engineering personnel  materials and other product development related costs 
r d is expensed as incurred 
we believe our r d expenses will generally increase as we continue to develop new products 
other income expense 
other income expense consists of interest income and expense  and realized gains and losses on investments 
we repaid most of our outstanding indebtedness with a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering in november and repaid the remainder in february proceeds from our initial public offering were invested in available for sale and trading securities 
the change in carrying value of preferred stock warrants recorded in is associated with the value of warrants classified as liabilities 
these warrants converted into common stock warrants in connection with our initial public offering 
we no longer incur this non cash gain or loss following the conversion of these warrants to common stock warrants 
additional information on our accounting for change in carrying value of preferred stock warrants is provided in critical accounting policies and estimates 
provision for income tax 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method whereby the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book value and the tax basis of assets and liabilities are recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recognized 
a full valuation allowance is provided as management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
at december   we had million in net operating loss carryforwards nols 
we believe that we are not restricted in our ability to use the full amount of the nols  nor is there a limit to the amount of nols that may be used in any given year however  we will be updating our analysis in and the results of that analysis may indicate an ownership change 
if an ownership change is determined  the utilization of the net operating losses may be limited 
as of december   no tax benefit has been recognized for these loss carryforwards 
stock based compensation 
the majority of our stock based compensation relates primarily to administrative personnel and is accounted for as a general and administrative expense 
for the years ended december   and  our stock based compensation expense was   and  respectively

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
revenue was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
the impact of the worldwide economic crisis resulted in lower revenue across all product lines for the year ended december  revenue from the sale of our led substrate products for the year ended december  decreased million 
an million decrease in revenue due to lower average selling prices as a result of reduced demand was partially offset by an increase in volume of million 
the sos rfic business was also impacted by the downturn in the consumer electronics market 
in addition  revenue from this market was impacted by lower orders in from our key sos rfic customer due to a build up of inventory at that customer 
revenue for the sos rfic business decreased  or million  of which million was attributable to a decrease in volume and  was attributable to a decrease in pricing 
we completed an r d contract in and  as a result  our revenue from research and development was million lower in than it was in the prior year 
we do not currently have any open r d contracts with customers 
revenue from our optical products was lower in by million as the market for sapphire used for sensor and instrumentation applications was also affected by the economic slowdown 
demand for our products began to improve in the second half of and our average selling prices began to increase in the fourth quarter of fourth quarter total revenue increased from the fourth quarter as the market began to rebound significantly 
we expect demand for sapphire to continue to strengthen in and anticipate a further increase in pricing of our products as a result of an increase in demand for led based products including backlighting units used in led backlit lcd televisions  notebook computers  and desktop monitors 
gross profit loss 
gross profit loss was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the revenue decline of million in was partially offset by a reduction in manufacturing expenses of million 
we also experienced lower contract revenue of million in which had little or no direct costs 
with the decrease in orders we also experienced lower utilization of equipment and staff which resulted in underabsorbed manufacturing costs of million 
the remaining decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to lower average selling prices 
in the fourth quarter  we achieved a positive gross profit margin of 
with increasing prices  better product mix and improved utilization of equipment and staff  we expect gross profit to continue to improve in general and administrative expenses 
g a expenses were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily due an adjustment to our bad debt reserve of million 
we were able to reduce our reserve in as our customer s improved economic condition reduced the uncertainty regarding our customer s ability to pay us 
we also experienced a decrease of  of costs associated with a follow on public offering incurred in and not in  and a  decrease in bonuses as no bonus expense was incurred in the decreases were offset by  in increased legal costs   in increased salary and stock compensation expenses  and  in higher business insurance premiums 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase in sales and marketing expenses is primarily attributable to additional payroll expenses of  which includes a salesperson in the japan sales office that opened in  as well as  in costs associated with operating the japan sales office 
research and development expenses 
r d expenses were  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in payroll costs of  offset by an increase of  in materials purchased for research projects and other costs 
other income 
other income was  for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   a decrease in other income of million 
the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in interest income as a result of lower investment principal and lower average returns 

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
revenue was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
revenue increased across all product lines except for six inch as ground wafers  which declined by million as we shifted six inch capacity to six inch polished production 
revenue from six inch polished products to the sos rfic market increased by million 
our revenue increase is also attributable to an increase in volume shipments of larger diameter substrates to the led industry resulting in additional revenue of million partially offset by lower pricing of million 
we also achieved higher revenue of  from optical products due to increased sales of sapphire and fluorides for military  sensor and instrumentation applications as we continued our efforts to increase our share of this market 
we had higher contract research revenue of million as we met deliverables associated with our contract for the development of eight inch wafers 
fourth quarter revenue from the led industry was down approximately from both the prior quarter and from the fourth quarter of as the impact of the worldwide economic crisis resulted in excess inventory throughout the led supply chain which significantly reduced orders 
in addition  the sos rfic business is largely dependent upon the consumer electronics market which also had a significant downturn in the fourth quarter of consequently  we had no sos rfic revenue in the fourth quarter of gross profit 
gross profit was million for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  gross profit in was unchanged from as sales of higher margin products increased and an increase of million of direct contract revenue which has little direct cost associated with it were partially offset by increased costs attributable to lower utilization of equipment and staff which resulted in underabsorbed manufacturing costs of approximately million as a result of decreased demand in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expenses 
g a expenses were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase was primarily due to million of higher audit  investor related  insurance  legal and board costs associated with operating as a public company   of costs associated with a follow on public offering  a  increase in bad debt expense due to slower customer payments  and a  increase in franchise taxes due to increased assets and capitalization of the company  partially offset by a million reduction in bonuses due to lower performance bonuses and no ipo bonuses being paid in in addition  partially offsetting the increase were  of lawsuit settlement payments and  of financing fees associated with debt refinancing and extinguishment not incurred in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase in sales and marketing expenses is attributable to additional payroll expenses of  for new sales personnel to support and grow our optical and substrate businesses and payroll taxes associated with the exercise of stock options 
marketing expenses associated with efforts to increase our customer base and expand our optical business also increased by research and development expenses 
r d expenses were  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in payroll costs of  offset by a decrease of  in materials purchased for research projects and other costs 
other income expense 
other income expense was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   an increase in net other income of million 
the increase was due in part to the elimination of charges relating to the carrying value of preferred stock warrants  which were million in the year ended december  interest expense decreased by million as a result of extinguishing our debt  and interest income increased by million on interest earned on invested 
table of contents proceeds from our ipo 
also included in the year ended december  was a recognized net realized loss on investments of  which reflected a gain of million representing the initial fair value of auction rate security put options and the changes in the fair value of the put options  partially offset by a loss of million which represented the recognizing of unrealized losses previously recorded in comprehensive income due to the transfer of auction rate securities from available for sale to trading securities and the subsequent changes in the fair value of the auction rate securities from the election date to the end of the year 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our operations using a combination of issuances of common and preferred stock  a working capital line of credit and term loans and cash generated from our operations 
since our inception  we have raised approximately million of equity from both private and public issuances of common and preferred stock 
as of december   we had cash and short term investments totaling million  including cash of million held in deposits at major banks  million invested in money market funds and short term investments in certificates of deposit  commercial paper  state and local bonds  auction rate securities and put options  and us treasury securities of million 
our long term investment consists of a million investment in peregrine semiconductor  corp 
one of our customers series d preferred stock 
in february  we began experiencing failed auctions of our entire auction rate securities portfolio  resulting in our inability to sell these securities in the short term 
all of the auction rate securities are aaa rated by one or more of the major credit rating agencies and have contractual maturities from to further  all of these securities are collateralized by student loans  and approximately of the collateral qualifies under the federal family education loan program and is guaranteed by the us government 
we are receiving the underlying cash flows interest and redemptions on all of our auction rate securities 
we are unable to predict if these funds will become available before their maturity dates 
we also hold put options associated with an agreement with ubs  ag related to the auction rate securities purchased through them 
it is our intent to exercise these put options at the first available date 
therefore  the auction rate securities and the related put options have been classified as short term investments as of december  in october  we entered into an agreement with ubs  ag  which provides us with certain rights to sell to ubs  ag all of our auction rate securities that were purchased through them 
we have the option to sell these securities to ubs  ag at par value from june  through july  ubs  ag  at its discretion  may purchase or sell these securities on our behalf at any time  provided we receive par value for the securities sold 
the issuers of the auction rate securities continue to have the right to redeem the securities at their discretion 
this agreement also permits us to establish a demand revolving credit line in an amount equal to the par value of the securities at a net no cost 
if our debt is determined to be rated below investment grade or is not rated  the amount that can be borrowed is limited to of the market value of the auction rate securities 
as of december   we had no loans outstanding under this agreement 
our right to sell the auction rate securities to ubs  ag commencing on june  represents put options for a payment equal to the par value of the auction rate securities 
we value the put options at their estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow model 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded a realized gain loss of  and  respectively  representing the changes in fair value of the put options 
we also recorded during years ended december  and  a gain loss of  and  respectively  representing the changes in fair value of the auction rate securities 
both the gain and loss from recording the change in fair value of the put options and auction rate securities were recorded in gain loss on investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
we do not expect to need access to the auction rate securities capital prior to the maturity of the auction rate security put options 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  during such period  we generated a net loss of million  which included non cash charges of million  including depreciation expense of million and stock based compensation expense of  during such period  cash from net working capital increased by  which was composed of an increase in accounts receivable of million due to higher sales in the fourth quarter  an increase of accrued other liabilities of  primarily due to the amount owed on land purchased in malaysia  a decrease in inventory of million due to sales product mix requirements  a decrease in spare parts of million due to the increased usage of furnace material inventory  a decrease in accounts payable of  due to timing of ordering and payments and a decrease in accrued payroll of  attributable to the decrease in performance based bonus expenses offset by the increase in headcount 
cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  during such period  we generated net income of million  which included non cash charges of million  including depreciation expense of million  net loss on disposal of equipment of million  and stock based compensation expense of  we experienced an increase during such period in inventory of million due primarily to an increase in safety stocks of raw material and sapphire boule inventory of million and an increase of million in other work in process and finished goods inventory 
there is no shelf life to our raw material and essentially all of our products can be manufactured from any one boule 
therefore  building a safety stock of this inventory enables us to quickly respond to an increase in demand from our customers 
we also experienced an increase in spare parts of million due to an increase in furnace material inventory used to support a larger number of furnaces  deferred revenue decreased by  due to recognition of revenue deferred on a research and development project  accrued payroll decreased by  on a lower performance based bonus accrual and other accrued liabilities decreased by  due to timing of payments 
the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   is primarily attributable to an increase of million of raw material  boule and spare parts inventories in the year ended december  compared to an increase of million in the year ended december  as safety stocks were increased 
this was partially offset by net income of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december   which included million of non cash change in carrying value of preferred stock 
net income increased on higher revenue on higher margin larger diameter products but was partially offset by higher production costs attributable to lower utilization of equipment and staff as a result of a decrease in fourth quarter production as orders and demand declined 
cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  during such period  we generated a net loss of million and incurred non cash charges of million  including depreciation expense of million  change in carrying value of preferred stock warrant expense of million  stock based compensation expense of  net loss on disposal of equipment of  and interest expense related to debt accretion of  we experienced an increase during such period in accounts receivable of million on increased sales  an increase in accounts payable of million and an increase in inventory and spare parts of million due primarily to an increase in safety stock of raw material inventory 
we also experienced an increase in corporate income and franchise taxes of  due to an increase in assets and capitalization from our initial public offering and an increase in deferred revenue of  due to revenue deferral on a research and development project 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   is primarily attributable to a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december   as sales volume and pricing increased and our production costs declined 
further  the non cash change in carrying value of preferred stock warrant expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  as sales increased in  we experienced increases in accounts receivable and inventory partially offset by increases in accounts payable in order to meet the rising customer demands 

table of contents cash flows used in investing activities net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  we used approximately million to purchase components to construct additional crystal growth furnaces  approximately  to expand and upgrade our bensenville  illinois facility and  for other upgrades in our fabrication  slicing  and polishing operations 
we also used  to purchase land in malaysia to continue to expand our capacity 
we purchased additional investments of  using investment earnings proceeds 
this was offset by proceeds from sales of investments of million 
in  we used approximately million to purchase components used to construct additional crystal growth furnaces  approximately million for infrastructure changes needed to expand operations in our bensenville  illinois facility and approximately million to purchase various equipment used to expand our production capacity in support of our sales growth 
we purchased additional investments of million using investment earnings proceeds 
this was partially offset by proceeds from sales of investments of million 
in  we used approximately million to purchase components used to construct additional crystal growth furnaces  approximately million for infrastructure changes needed to commence operations in our new bensenville  illinois facility and approximately million to purchase various equipment used to expand our production capacity in support of our sales growth 
also in  we used the proceeds of our initial public offering to purchase short term investment securities 
we are planning on expanding our crystal growth facilities in illinois and are building a facility in malaysia that will support post crystal growth manufacturing 
it is difficult to predict the timing of capital expenditures on these projects  but we anticipate the total cost of these projects to be between and million to be spent over a two year period and expect our capital expenditures to be between million and million 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities for reflects stock repurchases of million  partially offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  net cash used in financing activities for reflects stock repurchases of million  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  net cash provided by financing activities for reflects net proceeds received from our initial public offering of million  offset by the net repayment of borrowings of million 
future liquidity requirements we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  investments  and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to continue our expansion projects for the next twelve months 
however  we may secure debt or additional equity financing over the next year to provide additional liquidity 
our cash needs include cash required to fund our operations  taking into account the capital needed to fund our planned expansions in the us and asia 
if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenues and expenses change  or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise  we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or convertible debt securities 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted  and these newly issued securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 
if we obtain debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
if we are unable to obtain financing on terms favorable to us  we may be unable to successfully execute our business plan 

table of contents contractual obligations the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments at december  changes in our business needs as well as actions by third parties and other factors may cause these estimates to change 
because these estimates are complex and necessarily subjective  our actual payments in future periods are likely to vary from those presented in the table 
the following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations at december  payments due in total less than year years years more than years in millions operating lease obligations purchase order obligations building construction obligations total contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements during  and  we did not engage in any off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities  which includes special purpose entities and other structured finance entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss related to changes in market prices  including interest rates  of financial instruments that may adversely impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk 
to date  substantially all of our international sales have been transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and do not enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
interest rate risk 
we do not have any long term borrowings 
our investments consist of cash  cash equivalents  commercial paper  state and local bonds  and us treasury securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
we do not enter into investments for speculative purposes 
our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  we do not believe an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates 
inflation 
our operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by inflation 
however  historically  the prices we charge our customers are market driven  and therefore we may not be able to increase our prices to offset any increase in our material or labor costs 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other 
table of contents assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on our present best knowledge of the future impact on the company of current events and actions  actual results may differ from these estimates  assumptions and judgments 
we consider to be critical those accounting policies that require our most subjective or complex judgments  which often result from a need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and that are among the most important of our accounting policies in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies  including the more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from sales of products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we require evidence of a purchase order with the customer specifying the terms and specifications of the product to be delivered  typically in the form of a signed quotation or purchase order from the customer 
title has passed and the product has been delivered 
title passage and product delivery generally occur when the product is delivered to a common carrier 
the price is fixed or determinable 
all terms are fixed in the signed quotation or purchase order received from the customer 
the purchase orders do not contain rights of cancellation  return  exchanges or refunds 
collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our standard arrangement with customers includes day payment terms 
customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates each customer s financial position and its ability to pay 
we determine collectability by considering the length of time the customer has been in business and our history of collections with that customer 
if it is determined that collection is not probable  no product is shipped and no revenue is recognized unless cash is received in advance 
r d revenue is recognized as services are performed 
we execute agreements with our customers that clearly describe the scope of the project  the services we will provide  ownership of any tangible or intangible assets generated as part of the project  and the amount of consideration we will receive 
there are no significant judgments or estimates associated with our revenue recognition policies or processes 
all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars 
inventory 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
market is determined based on net realizable value 
cost is determined for raw materials on a first in  first out basis and work in process and finished goods are based on actual costs 
we establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based on customer required specifications 
we evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors  including forecasted sales  estimated current and future market value and changes in customers product specifications 
recoveries of previously written down inventory are recognized only when the related inventory is sold and revenue has been recognized 
inventory reserves increased in by  primarily as demand and pricing decreased 
based on improved demand and pricing of our products  we believe that it is unlikely that significant adjustments for inventory obsolescence will occur in our method of estimating excess and obsolete inventory has remained consistent for all periods presented 
however  if our recognition of excess or obsolete inventory is  or if our estimates of our inventory s potential utility become  less favorable than currently expected  additional inventory reserves may be required 
we determine our normal operating capacity and record as expense costs attributable to lower utilization of equipment and staff 
during and  we determined we were not operating at capacity and recorded as expense costs associated with lower utilization of equipment and staff of million and million 

table of contents investments 
we invest available cash primarily in investment grade commercial paper  corporate notes  government securities and auction rate securities 
investments classified as available for sale securities are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
investments in trading securities are reported at fair value  with both realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in other income expense  net in the statement of operations 
investments in which we have the ability and intent  if necessary  to liquidate in order to support our current operations are classified as short term 
our long term investments consist primarily of auction rate securities and put options 
we review our available for sale securities investments at the end of each quarter for other than temporary declines in fair value based on the specific identification method 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in underlying credit ratings  forecasted recovery  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value and the probability that the scheduled cash payments will continue to be made 
when we conclude that an other than temporary impairment has resulted  the difference between the fair value and carrying value is written off and recorded as a charge on the statement of operations 
in october  we entered into an agreement that provides us with the right  but not the obligation  to sell all our auction rate securities to ubs ag for par value during the period of june  to july  the ars put options 
the ars put options provide us with the opportunity to recover the estimated unrealized loss on our ars investments 
we recorded the fair value of the ars put options upon receipt and included it in other long term assets on our december  balance sheet 
we elected fair value accounting for the ars put options 
unrealized gains and losses related to the ars put options will be recognized in earnings 
we value the auction rate securities and ars put options using a discounted cash flow model that weights various factors including interest rates and expected holding period 
at december   the fair value recorded on the balance sheet of auction rate securities and ars put options was million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts 
the determination of risk for collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis considering our historical experience and future orders with the customer  changes in payment patterns  and recent information we have about the current status of our accounts receivable balances 
if we determine that a specific customer is a risk for collection  we provide a specific allowance for credit losses to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
we believe that based on the customers to whom we sell and the nature of our agreements with them  our estimates are reasonable 
our method of estimating collectability has remained consistent for all periods presented and with past collections experience 
stock based compensation 
we expense stock options based upon the fair market value on the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model will be affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates  forfeitures and expected dividends 
the expected term represents the weighted average period that our stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based upon the vesting term of our options  a review of a peer group of companies  and expected exercise behavior 
until november  we were operating as a private company  and as a result  we were unable to use our actual price volatility data 
therefore  we estimate the volatility of our common stock based on volatility of similar entities over the expected term of our stock options 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and  therefore  use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate 
table of contents forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the current forfeiture rate of was based on our past history of pre vesting forfeitures and the forfeiture rate has remained constant 
we allocate stock based compensation costs using a straight line method which amortizes the fair value of each option on a straight line basis over the service period 
based on the variables affecting the valuation of our common stock and the method used for allocating compensation costs  we recognized  in stock based compensation expense during the year ended december  with respect to each option grant date for the year ended december   and through november   we determined the deemed fair value of our common stock 
as there was no public market for our common stock during these periods  this determination was necessarily subjective 
in making this determination  we considered a number of factors  including the issuance price of our series of preferred shares to third parties  the liquidation preference and other rights of the preferred shares  and the fact that the option grants involved illiquid securities of a private company 
for options granted through november   the board of directors set the exercise price for options granted based upon estimates of fair value 
in preparing for our initial public offering  the board of directors determined that the original methodology applied did not fully comply with the requirements in the aicpa s practice aid valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  which we refer to as the practice aid 
revised valuations were prepared which yielded lower fair values for our common stock 
see valuation methodologies employed below for further disclosure of the valuation methodology used in determining fair value per share for financial reporting purposes 
therefore  for financial reporting purposes  we determined that it was appropriate to use for options granted in june and august as the fair value of our common stock within the black scholes option pricing model is consistent with the revised valuation 
for stock option grants after our initial public offering  the board of directors set the exercise price at the fair market value per share on the date of grant 
the following table sets forth option grants made during  with the intrinsic value calculated based on grant date fair value 
date of grant number of options granted exercise price fair value estimate per share intrinsic value per share june august november december the financial reporting intrinsic value per share is the difference between the subsequently reassessed fair value per share for financial statement reporting purposes and the exercise price per share as established on each applicable stock option grant date by our compensation committee and board of directors as described above 
there is no intrinsic value because the exercise price per share of each option equaled or exceeded the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant 

table of contents valuation methodologies employed 
the valuation methodologies we employed in connection with these option grants were based on various generally accepted valuation methods 
specifically  at each reporting date we analyzed the value of the company  or the business enterprise value  using market and income approaches  and then allocated the business enterprise value using contingent claims analysis  an application of option pricing theory 
the allocation of the business enterprise value to convertible preferred stock  common stock  warrants and stock options at september   june  and march  used option pricing theory and considered the probability of an initial public offering 
in determining the business enterprise value at september   june  and march   we used both market and income value approaches 
the market approach used both comparable company and transaction valuation methods 
the comparable company market approach used revenue multiples observed in active securities markets and the transaction method used both revenue and ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization multiples observed in the mergers and acquisitions market 
the income approach determines a business enterprise value using the discounted present value of projected cash flow streams 
the final business enterprise value determined using the market and income approaches was then adjusted for appropriate marketability discounts 
these marketability discounts were reduced at each reporting date  beginning with the december  reporting date  to reflect the increased probability of the initial public offering 
the allocation of the business enterprise value to each class of preferred stock and common stock was determined using contingent claims analysis  which is based on the principles of option pricing theory 
specifically  each class of security is modeled as a call option with a unique claim on our assets 
the resulting claims allocate the anticipated proceeds between the different securities upon a liquidity event  which in our case was our initial public offering 
in modeling each security as a call option  we used the black scholes option pricing model 
determining the fair value of our convertible preferred stock  common stock  warrants and stock options involves complex and subjective judgments involving estimates of revenue  earnings  assumed market growth rates and estimated costs  as well as appropriate discount rates 
at the time of each valuation  the significant estimates used in the income approach discounted cash flow model included estimates of our revenue and revenue growth rates for several years into the future 
although each time we prepared such forecasts in the preparation of a valuation report we did so based on assumptions that we believed to be reasonable and appropriate  there can be no assurance that any such estimates for earlier periods have come to pass or that any such estimates for future periods will prove to be accurate 
the most significant factors contributing to the difference between the fair value of the shares of our common stock subject to our stock option grants and the initial public offering price are the increase in probability of the completion of an initial public offering of our common stock and positive changes in market conditions 
due to our history of operating losses prior to  including negative gross profit in  our ability to achieve our initial public offering price was highly contingent on achieving current strong operating results 
achieving strong operating results in the quarter ended september  and through completion of our initial public offering validated our financial projections for subsequent periods and resulted in our ability to obtain the estimated initial public offering price 
all option grants made during and were granted at an exercise price per share equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
therefore  there is no intrinsic value because the exercise price per share of each option was equal to the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant 
based on the fair market value of the common stock at december   the intrinsic value for the options outstanding was  and the intrinsic value for the options exercisable was  at december   there was no aggregate intrinsic value of all stock options outstanding 

table of contents convertible preferred stock warrant liability 
we accounted for warrants to purchase our preferred stock issued in connection with financing agreements by evaluating certain specifically identified conditions to determine whether the fair value of these warrants is required to be classified as a liability 
the fair value of the warrants that are classified as liabilities are adjusted for changes in fair value at each reporting period  and the corresponding non cash gain or loss is recorded in current period earnings 
we estimated the fair market value of these warrants at the respective balance sheet dates using a black scholes option pricing model  based on the estimated market value of the underlying preferred stock at the measurement date  the remaining contractual term of the warrant  risk free interest rates and expected dividends on and expected volatility of the price of the underlying preferred stock 
these estimates  especially the market value of the underlying preferred stock and the expected volatility  are highly judgmental 
the assumptions used in our black scholes option pricing model for series e  c  b  b and a warrants at january  upon the adoption of fsp were i remaining contractual terms of to years  ii risk free interest rate of to  iii expected volatility of to  and iv no expected dividend yield 
the assumptions used in our black scholes option pricing model for series e  c  b  b and a warrants at december  were i remaining contractual terms of to years  ii risk free interest rates of to  iii expected volatility of to  and iv no expected dividend yield 
in each case  the fair value of the underlying preferred stock was assessed primarily by a valuation prepared by management using the practice aid 
upon the closing of our initial public offering in november  outstanding warrants to purchase our preferred stock became warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and certain of these warrants to purchase our preferred stock were net exercised 
as a result  upon the conversion of the preferred stock warrants to common stock warrants  the warrants were no longer subject to fair market valuation 
the then current aggregate fair value of these warrants was reclassified from liabilities to additional paid in capital  a component of stockholders equity  and we ceased to record any related periodic fair value adjustments 
redeemable convertible preferred stock 
prior to our initial public offering  we issued various classes of preferred stock 
the holders of series a  b  b  c  c  d  d and e preferred stock had the option to sell their shares back to us at the greater of the original purchase price plus accrued and unpaid dividends or the current fair market value of the shares plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
as a result  the carrying value of the preferred stock was increased by an accretion amount each period so that the carrying amounts will equal the greater of fair value plus accrued and unpaid dividends or original purchase price plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
the accreted amounts are recorded to accumulated deficit 
the option to sell and the related accretion of the preferred shares terminated upon the closing of our initial public offering 
the fair value of our preferred stock was determined based upon the sales price of our preferred stock to third party investors  and in and  when transactions in our preferred stock were not available  based upon valuations prepared by management using the methodology set forth in the practice aid 
this methodology considered the probability and fair value of the sale of stock in an initial public offering 
the valuation methodologies we used to estimate the fair value of our preferred stock have been applied consistently for all periods presented and the assumptions used were based on the best available information at that time 
accordingly  we do not believe that adjustments to amounts recorded in respect of our redeemable convertible preferred stock will be required
