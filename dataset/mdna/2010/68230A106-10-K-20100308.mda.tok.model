overview of the company and developments oncogenex is a biopharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of new cancer therapies that address unmet needs in the treatment of cancer 
we have five product candidates in our pipeline  with each product candidate having a distinct mechanism of action and representing a unique opportunity for cancer drug development 

table of contents our product candidates ogx  ogx and ogx focus on mechanisms of treatment resistance in cancer patients and are designed to address treatment resistance by blocking the production of specific proteins which we believe promote survival of tumor cells and are over produced in response to a variety of cancer treatments 
our aim in targeting these particular proteins is to disable the tumor cell s adaptive defenses and thereby render the tumor cells more susceptible to attack with a variety of cancer therapies  including chemotherapy  which we believe will increase survival time and improve the quality of life for cancer patients 
product candidate sn is a novel camptothecin for the treatment of cancer 
camptothecins are potent anticancer agents that belong to the family of drugs called topoisomerase i inhibitors that bind reversibly to the topo i dna complex causing breaks in the dna strands during replication resulting in cell death 
product candidate csp is the lead compound from a family of compounds  which have been in licensed from bayer  that demonstrate activation of programmed cell death in pre clinical models 
product candidate ogx as discussed above  in december  we announced our entry into the collaboration agreement with teva  for the development and global commercialization of ogx and related compounds targeting clusterin with the exclusion of ogx and ogx 
oncogenex and teva have developed a clinical development plan under which three phase clinical trials will be initiated 
we have designed two of the phase clinical trials to evaluate the clinical benefit of ogx in crpc and  together with teva  we are in the process of designing a third phase clinical trial evaluating the clinical benefit of ogx in nsclc  as follows evaluating a survival benefit for ogx in combination with first line docetaxel treatment in approximately men with crpc  evaluating a durable pain palliation benefit for ogx in combination with docetaxel as second line chemotherapy in approximately men with crpc  and evaluating a survival benefit for ogx in combination with first line chemotherapy in at least patients with nsclc 
for detailed information regarding our relationship with teva and the collaboration agreement  refer to the discussion under the heading license and collaboration agreements teva pharmaceutical industries ltd  which is incorporated herein by reference 
during  ogx received fast track designations from the fda for the treatment of progressive metastatic prostate cancer in combination with docetaxel for both first and second line docetaxel treatment 
the fda has agreed on the design of two phase registration trials  each in crpc  via the spa process 
one trial design investigates overall survival as the primary endpoint for ogx in combination with first line chemotherapy  whereas the other trial design investigates pain palliation as the primary endpoint for ogx in combination with second line chemotherapy 
as discussed above  in february of  ogx received written  scientific advice from the ema on the company s development plan for ogx for the treatment of men with crpc 
the input received from the chmp at the ema was in overall agreement with oncogenex s development plan regarding the proposed preclinical studies and both the study designs and analyses for the phase iii trials 
the chmp also agreed that the intended safety database would enable a sufficiently qualified risk benefit assessment for market approval 
final results of a randomized phase trial evaluating the benefit of combining ogx with first line docetaxel chemotherapy were presented during an oral presentation at the asco annual meeting 
analyses indicating a survival benefit in patients treated with ogx in combination with first line docetaxel compared to docetaxel alone  the latter of which being the current standard care for patients with advanced  progressive metastatic prostate cancer  are described above under the heading summary of final results of ogx phase clinical trial in first line hormone refractory prostate cancer  which is incorporated herein by reference 

table of contents due to the final results of this randomized phase trial  the phase registration trial that teva will initiate in will evaluate the overall survival benefit of ogx in patients treated with first line chemotherapy 
durable pain palliation defined as pain palliation of weeks or greater has been observed in another phase trial evaluating patients with metastatic crpc who progressed while receiving  or within months of completing  first line docetaxel treatment 
in this trial  of patients who were retreated with docetaxel as second line treatment in combination with ogx had durable pain palliation 
this is favorable even when compared to the pain responses of weeks or greater observed in the phase study which supported the registration of docetaxel as first line chemotherapy in patients with crpc 
due to the results of our phase trial  the phase registration trial that oncogenex will initiate in will evaluate the durable pain palliation benefit of ogx in patients treated with second line chemotherapy 
product candidate ogx a phase trial has evaluated patients with a variety of cancers  with enrollment ongoing 
ogx was first evaluated as a single agent in a dose escalation manner up to mg ogx a maximum tolerated dose was not identified up to and including the mg dose of ogx monotherapy 
subsequently  as defined by the protocol  an mg dose of ogx in combination with docetaxel was evaluated  followed by a mg ogx plus docetaxel 
ogx is administered as three loading doses within the first nine days and then continued weekly  with three weeks defined as a treatment cycle  until disease progression or toxicity 
in those groups receiving ogx in combination with docetaxel  mg m docetaxel was administered on day of every week cycle starting after completion of the ogx loading doses 
preliminary results of this phase trial were presented during an oral presentation at the asco annual meeting 
at that time  patients were enrolled who had a diagnosis of breast  ovarian  prostate or non small cell lung cancer and most had failed multiple prior chemotherapy treatments 
a median of two cycles range of one to eight cycles was administered 
ogx treatment was well tolerated as a monotherapy 
no evidence of altered cardiac activity was observed 
a majority of adverse events were mild and mainly occurred during the loading doses 
adverse events consisted of chills  itching and fatigue in over one third of patients 
there was a trend for increasing incidence of some mild adverse events with escalating ogx doses 
for example  of patients at the mg dose compared to of patients at the mg dose had mild adverse events during the loading doses 
the half life of ogx in the blood remained constant  although there appeared to be an increase in maximum blood levels and a corresponding decrease in blood clearance of ogx as doses were escalated 
the combination of ogx with docetaxel at both dose levels was also well tolerated 
this data is subject to further analysis 
ctcs  an emerging metric to assess treatment effect  were evaluated at baseline before treatment and during ogx treatment as a monotherapy 
both total and hsp positive ctcs were evaluated 
declines of or greater in both total and hsp positive ctcs were observed in over one half of the patients in each cohort and in each type of cancer 
declines in hsp ctcs to or less cells occurred in of patients who had greater than ctcs at baseline 
reduction in tumor markers defined as declines of prostate specific antigen  or psa  levels in prostate cancer or ca levels in ovarian cancer were also observed 
a reduction in psa level was observed in of patients with prostate cancer and a reduction in ca levels was observed in of patients with ovarian cancer 

table of contents a second investigator sponsored phase clinical trial evaluating ogx when administered directly into the bladder in patients with bladder cancer was initiated in august the study  which will enroll up to patients with bladder cancer  is designed to determine the safety and potential benefit of ogx administered directly into the bladder using a catheter  which is known as intravesical instillation 
in addition  the study will measure the direct effect of ogx on expression of hsp in bladder tumor cells as well as determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ogx when delivered by intravesical instillation 
this investigator sponsored study is funded by the national cancer institute of canada ncic 
in january  we announced that an investigator sponsored phase clinical trial evaluating ogx when administered as a monotherapy to patients with crpc has received grant funding 
the randomized  controlled phase study will enroll up to patients and is designed to determine the potential benefit of ogx by evaluating the number of patients who are without disease progression at weeks post study treatment with or without ogx this phase trial will also measure the direct effect of ogx on psa levels  time to progression by psa or measurable disease  numbers of ctcs and other relevant secondary endpoints 
the trial is expected to start by mid following final analysis of phase data and approval by health canada and the institutional review board 
the funds were awarded by a third party granting agency to dr 
kim chi  a medical oncologist at the bc cancer agency  research scientist at the vancouver prostate centre and the principal investigator of the ogx phase trial 
product candidates ogx  sn and csp sn was evaluated in a phase clinical trial to evaluate safety in patients with advanced cancer who have received on average three to five prior chemotherapy treatments 
sn has been administered to patients with various types of cancer in a phase clinical trial 
the phase clinical trial has been completed and the dose limiting toxicity that defined a maximum tolerated dose in this heavily pretreated patient population has been determined 
we do not intend to initiate additional trials for sn but rather will seek to out license or sell this product candidate to a third party 
ogx  an inhibitor of insulin growth factor binding proteins and  and csp are in pre clinical development 
collaboration revenue we recorded million of collaboration revenue in connection with our ogx collaboration agreement with teva in the year ended december  at december   million of the upfront payment was included in the balance sheet line item deferred collaboration revenue  which we are amortizing over a period of approximately years based on the expected performance period of our deliverables under this agreement 
further  we are eligible to receive payments of up to upon the achievement of developmental and commercial milestones 
at present  we are unable to predict the timing or likelihood of such milestone payments  although we do not expect to receive any milestone payments from teva in the year ended december  there were no revenues in or see note in the notes to financial statements for further details on our collaboration with teva 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses consist primarily of costs for milestone payments to third parties  clinical trials  materials and supplies  facilities  personnel  including salaries and benefits  regulatory activities  pre clinical studies  licensing and intellectual property  and allocations of other research and development related costs 
external research and development expenses include fees paid to universities  hospitals and other entities that conduct certain research and development activities and that manufacture our product candidates for use in our clinical trials 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly in the future as we continue to develop our product candidates 
currently  oncogenex manages its clinical trials through independent medical investigators at their sites and at hospitals 
under the collaboration agreement with teva  we are required to spend million towards development of ogx which will include personnel costs for certain development activities 
teva will fund all other expenses under the clinical development plan 
a total of million of costs incurred by the company in were applied against the company s million funding commitment  resulting in a remaining funding commitment of million at december  we expect full time equivalent reimbursement of between and million per year from to we expect to incur the remaining costs associated with the clinical development plan over the next three years 

table of contents a majority of the company s expenditures to date have been related to the development of ogx until july   ogx was being co developed with isis and r d expenses for ogx were shared on the basis of oncogenex and isis 
on july   oncogenex and isis amended their agreement to provide for unilateral development of ogx by oncogenex 
in connection with the collaboration agreement and pursuant to the terms of agreements between the company and isis relating to ogx  the company accrued a payment of million to isis  which was included in r d expenses in the period 
the company also accrued a payment of approximately  to ubc pursuant to the terms of their license agreement relating to ogx  which was also included in r d expenses in the period 
several of the company s clinical trials have been supported by grant funding which was received directly by the hospitals and or clinical investigators conducting the clinical trials allowing oncogenex to complete these clinical trials with minimal expense 
since the company s drug candidates are in the early stage of development  we cannot estimate completion dates for development activities or when we might receive material net cash inflows from our research and development projects 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in as we further expand development of ogx  ogx and our other programs 
our projects or intended projects may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our research and development priorities and available resources 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our personnel in executive  business development  human resources  external communications  finance and other administrative functions  as well as consulting costs  including market research and business consulting 
other costs include professional fees for legal and auditing services  insurance and facility costs 
we believe that g a resources are sufficient to carry on existing development activities 
we anticipate that g a expenses will increase significantly in the future as we continue to expand our operating activities 
restructuring activities on august   immediately following the completion of the arrangement  the company reduced its workforce by approximately 
severance payable at the date of the restructuring in connection with former employees of sonus was  and has been accounted for in accordance with eitf no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination as part of the purchase price allocation 
during  the company made payments totalling  and the amount owing at december  was  all remaining severance liabilities relating to transaction related workforce reductions were paid out during  and the amount owing at december  was nil 
prior to the arrangement  sonus entered into a non cancellable lease arrangement for office space located in bothell  washington  which is considered to be in excess of the company s current requirements 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating opportunities to exit or sublet portions of the leased space and recorded an initial restructuring charge of  on august  as part of the purchase price allocation 
the liability is computed as the present value of the difference between the remaining lease payments due less the estimate of net sublease income and expenses and has been accounted for in accordance with eitf no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
this represents the company s best estimate of the fair value of the liability 
subsequent changes in the liability due to accretion  or changes in estimates of sublease assumptions will be recognized as adjustments to restructuring charges in future periods 
during   was amortized into income  resulting in a remaining liability 

table of contents in june the company revised its sublease income assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the excess lease facility liability 
these assumptions were subsequently revised again in december these changes in estimate resulted in increases in the fair value of the excess lease liability and  and  in charges to research and development expense recorded in june and december  respectively  to reflect these changes in estimate 
these changes in estimate had a impact on loss per common share for year ended december  the estimated carrying value of the liability remaining at december  with respect to excess facilities is  results of operations the consolidated financial statements reflect the arrangement between sonus and oncogenex technologies as a reverse acquisition  whereby oncogenex technologies is deemed to be the acquiring entity from an accounting perspective 
accordingly  for the year ended december   the consolidated results of operations of the company include only the results of operations of oncogenex technologies for the time period of january  through august  and the results of the combined company following the completion of the arrangement on august  the consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  include only the consolidated results of operations of oncogenex technologies and do not include historical results of sonus 
this treatment and presentation is in accordance with sfas  business combinations 
proforma results are included in note to the financial statements 
years ended december  and december  r d expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   due mainly to higher ogx and ogx development costs  milestone payments owed to isis and ubc resulting from the collaboration agreement with teva  an increase in employee expenses and higher facility costs resulting from the arrangement 
included in the year ended december  was a sred claim of million  which offset r d expenses in the period 
since oncogenex technologies ceased to be a canadian controlled private company under canadian tax laws as a result of the arrangement  sred claims can now only be applied against taxes payable 
the sred program is a canadian federal tax incentive program that encourages canadian businesses to conduct research and development in canada 
g a expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   due mainly to higher employee expenses and increased costs associated with operating as a public company 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased to thousand from thousand for year ended december  of the thousand in interest for the period  thousand related to interest received from the canada revenue agency in relation to the company s scientific research and development claim  while the amount includes only interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
other for the year ended december  decreased to thousand in income from to thousand in income for the year ended december   due to lower gains on sales of equipment 
years ended december  and december  r d expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   which reflects an increase of million due mainly to costs associated with the development of ogx  an increase in employee expenses and higher facility costs both resulting from the reverse takeover of sonus 

table of contents g a expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   which reflects a decrease of approximately thousand due mainly to higher costs associated with employee expenses and increased costs associated with operating as a public company  offset by higher costs incurred as part of a planned initial public offering in by oncogenex technologies which was later abandoned 
interest income for the year ended december  was thousand compared to thousand for year ended december   which reflects an increase of thousand due mainly to an increase in cash equivalents and short term investments 
other for the year ended december  was thousand in income compared to thousand in expense for the year ended december   due to gains on sales of equipment  and foreign exchange gains 
liquidity and capital resources oncogenex has incurred an accumulated deficit of million through december   and we expect to incur substantial and increasing additional losses in the future as we expand our research and development activities 
we have not generated any revenue from product sales to date  and we do not expect to generate product sales revenue for several years  if ever 
in the year ended december   we generated million in collaboration revenue from the teva collaboration agreement 
all of our operations to date have been funded through the sale of our debt and equity securities  and upfront payments received from teva 
as at december   oncogenex had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million in the aggregate as compared to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million as at december  as at december   oncogenex does not have any borrowing or credit facilities available to it 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our capital resources at december  will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations into and expect that both phase prostate cancer trials will be fully accrued by this time 
we may seek additional funding through  among other things  executing a partnership or collaboration agreement  or licensing or sale of certain of our product candidates  or through private or public offerings of our equity securities or debt financings 
our currently planned operations are set forth below under the heading operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 
cash flows cash used in operations for the years ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million of net cash used in operation in this increase in cash provided by operating activities during was driven by the upfront cash payment from teva  offset by increased r d expenses associated with personnel and facilities assumed in the arrangement  cash used to reduce liabilities assumed in the arrangement and increased current assets associated with r d activities 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations of million was attributable primarily to our losses from operations  offset by an increase in investment tax credit recoverable of million  and an increase in taxes payable under part vi 
of the income tax act part vi 
tax of million and the interest on its convertible debentures of million 
cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december  and  net cash provided by financing activities was million and thousand respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was attributable to the net proceeds we received from the issuance of common shares through a registered direct offering  net proceeds we received from the issuance of common shares to teva as part of the share purchase agreement  and the proceeds from the issuance of common shares on stock option exercises 
all net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was the result of proceeds from the issuance of common shares on stock option exercises  offset by cash paid on the elimination of fractional shares following the one for eighteen reverse stock split 
all net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was due to the issuance of convertible debentures 

table of contents cash used provided by investing activities net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities in the year ended december  was due to transactions involving marketable securities in the normal course of business 
net cash provided by investing activities in the year ended december  was due to the arrangement with sonus and transactions involving marketable securities in the normal course of business 
net cash provided by investing activities for the years ended december  of million was due primarily to maturities of investments 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations into  including completing patient accrual in a phase clinical trial evaluating a durable pain palliation benefit for ogx in combination with docetaxel as second line chemotherapy in approximately men with crpc which we expect to initiate in the second quarter of  completing patient accrual in a phase clinical trial evaluating a survival benefit for ogx in combination with docetaxel as first line chemotherapy in approximately men with crpc which we expect to initiate in the third quarter of  completing follow up monitoring visits related to our completed phase clinical trials of ogx  completing follow up monitoring visits related to the phase clinical trial evaluating ogx as a monotherapy in patients with solid tumors and continuing evaluation of ogx in combination with docetaxel in patients with solid tumors  continuing an investigator sponsored phase clinical trial evaluating ogx treatment in patient with bladder cancer  initiating an investigator sponsored phase clinical trial evaluating ogx treatment in patients with prostate cancer  and meeting working capital needs  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
as of december  we have a remaining commitment to fund million towards the three phase trials of ogx  while teva is required to fund all additional expenses under the clinical development plan 
the final results from the phase trials may be released at a date beyond our current available cash runway 
in addition  if we desire to conduct development activities with respect to our other product candidates beyond those development activities mentioned in the list above  we will require additional funding to support such operations 
if and when needed to extend our cash availability or to conduct any such currently unplanned development activities  we would seek any such necessary funding through the licensing or sale of certain of our product candidates  executing a partnership or collaboration agreement  or through private or public offerings of our equity securities or debt financings 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including maintaining teva relationship and teva s ongoing level of focus and efforts to develop ogx  our ability to obtain additional funding through a partnership or collaboration agreement with a third party or licenses of certain of our product candidates  or through private or public offerings of our equity securities or debt financings  timing and costs of clinical trials  preclinical development and regulatory approvals  timing and cost of drug discovery and research and development  entering into new collaborative or product license agreements for products in our pipeline  and costs related to obtaining  defending and enforcing patents

contingencies and commitments teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
under the collaboration agreement  the company is required to contribute million in direct and indirect costs towards the clinical development plan 
million of these costs were incurred by oncogenex during  resulting in a remaining funding responsibility of million which has been recorded on the company s balance sheet as deferred collaboration revenue 
teva will fund all other expenses under the clinical development plan 
in addition to the development costs noted above  teva is also responsible for all costs relating to product commercialization including costs incurred in relation to the company s co promotion option  except for start up costs in advance of commercialization 

table of contents isis pharmaceuticals inc and university of british columbia pursuant to license agreements the company has with the ubc and isis  the company is obligated to pay royalties on future product sales and milestone payments of up to million upon the achievement of specified product development milestones related to ogx and ogx in addition  we are required to pay to isis of all non royalty revenue we receive 
isis has disclosed in its sec filings that it is entitled to receive of the up to million in milestone payments we may receive from teva as part of the collaboration agreement  however  we believe that certain of the milestone payments related to sales targets may qualify as royalty revenue  and therefore be subject to the lesser payment obligations 
no assurance can be provided that we will be entitled to receive these milestone payments or  if we are  that the applicable amount payable to isis will be less than 
we are also obligated to pay to ubc certain patent costs and annual license maintenance fees for the extent of the patent life of cad  per year 
we anticipate paying isis  in upon the initiation of a phase clinical trial of ogx in patients with crpc 
we do not anticipate making any royalty payments to isis in the ubc agreements have effective dates ranging from november  to april  and each agreement expires upon the later of years from its effective date or the expiry of the last patent licensed thereunder  unless otherwise terminated 
unless otherwise terminated  the isis agreements for ogx and ogx will continue for each product until the later of years after the date of the first commercial product sale  or the expiration of the last to expire of any patents required to be licensed in order to use or sell the product  unless oncogenex technologies abandons either ogx or ogx and isis does not elect to unilaterally continue development 
the isis agreement for ogx will continue into perpetuity unless oncogenex technologies abandons the product and isis does not elect to unilaterally continue development 
under the second isis amendment  the company is the subject of a change of control with a third party  where the surviving company immediately following such change of control has the right to develop and sell the product  then i a milestone payment of million will be due and payable to isis days following the first commercial sale of the product in the united states  and ii unless such surviving entity had previously sublicensed the product and a royalty rate payable to isis by the company has been established  the applicable royalty rate payable to isis will thereafter be the maximum amount payable under the company s agreement with isis 
any non royalty milestone amounts previously paid will be credited toward the million milestone if not already paid 
as a result of the million milestone payment payable to isis in relation to the collaboration agreement  the remaining amount owing in the event of change of control discussed above is a maximum of million 
as the company has now licensed the product to teva and established a royalty rate payable to isis  no royalty rate adjustments would apply if teva acquires the company and is the surviving company

table of contents material changes in financial condition in thousands december  december  total assets total liabilities total equity the increase in assets from december  primarily relates to increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities following the collaboration agreement with teva 
the increase in liabilities from december  relates to deferred collaboration revenue and milestone payments owing to isis and ubc resulting from our collaboration agreement with teva 
the increase in equity relates predominantly to the issuance of shares through private placements of our common stock and shares sold to teva 
critical accounting policies and estimates significant accounting policies revenue recognition revenue recognized to date is attributable solely to the upfront payment the company received in the fourth quarter of pursuant to its collaboration agreement with teva 
for a description of the collaboration agreement  see note in the notes to financial statements for further details on our collaboration with teva 
the collaboration agreement contains multiple elements and deliverables  and requires evaluation pursuant to asc  multiple element arrangements asc 
the company evaluated the facts and circumstances of the collaboration agreement to determine whether it had obligations constituting deliverables under asc the company concluded that it had multiple deliverables under the collaboration agreement  including deliverables relating to the grant of a technology license  and performance of manufacturing  regulatory and clinical development services in the us and canada  and estimated that the period in which the company would perform those deliverables began in the fourth quarter of and will be completed in because the company was able to establish vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the maintenance  regulatory  and clinical services  the company concluded that these deliverables should be accounted as separate units of accounting under asc in establishing vsoe for the manufacturing  regulatory  and clinical development services  management relied on rates charged by other service providers providing similar development services 
the company will recognize million allocated to the manufacturing  regulatory and clinical development services element as revenue over the estimated performance period  using the proportional performance model 
estimation of the performance period of the company s deliverables required the use of management s judgement 
significant factors considered in management s evaluation of the estimated performance period include  but are not limited to its experience  along with teva s experience  in conducting clinical development activities 
the company will review the estimated duration of its performance period on a quarterly basis and make any appropriate adjustments on a prospective basis 
future changes in estimates of the performance period may materially impact the timing of the future revenue recognized under the collaboration agreement 
because management is not able to reliably estimate the fair value of the technology license  it used the residual value approach to determine the amount of revenue to recognize 
based on this approach  the company recognized million in relating to this element 

table of contents under the collaboration agreement  the company is entitled to receive up to million upon the achievement of developmental and commercial milestones 
management evaluated the nature of the events triggering these contingent payments and concluded that these events constituted substantive milestones 
this conclusion was based primarily on the facts that each triggering event represents a specific outcome that can be achieved only through successful performance by the company of one or more of its deliverables  and that achievement of each triggering event was subject to inherent risk and uncertainty and would result in additional payments becoming due to the company 
management concluded that each of these milestones was substantive  based primarily on the facts that the payments they trigger are non refundable  that achievement of the milestone entails risk and was not reasonably assured at inception of the collaboration agreement  that substantial effort is required to complete each milestone  that the amount of each milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the value created in achieving the milestone  that a substantial amount of time is expected to pass between the upfront payment and the potential milestone payments  and that the milestone payments  once received  relate solely to past performance 
based on the foregoing  the company will recognize any revenue from these milestone payments under the substantive milestone method in the period in which the underlying triggering event occurs 
under the collaboration agreement  the company is also entitled to receive royalties on sales of ogx ranging from the mid teens to the mid twenties 
the company will recognize any revenue from these events based on the revenue recognition criteria set forth in asc  revenue recognition 
based on those criteria  the company considers these potential payments to be contingent revenues  and will recognize them as revenue in the period in which the applicable contingency is resolved 
under the collaboration agreement  the company and teva share certain ogx related development costs 
the company will be required to spend million in direct and indirect development costs such as full time equivalent fte reimbursement for time incurred by oncogenex personnel for the benefit of the ogx development plan  such contribution to be funded by the upfront payment provided by teva as an advanced reimbursement for the company development expenses 
teva will fund all other expenses under the clinical development plan clinical development plan 
once the company has fulfilled its requirement to spend million in direct and indirect development costs  including ftes  teva will  on a quarterly basis  reimburse all development expenses incurred in accordance with the clinical development plan 
the company s policy is to account for these reimbursements as collaboration revenue 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases and for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is provided for the portion of deferred tax assets that is more likely than not to be unrealized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws 
research and development costs research and development costs are expensed as incurred  net of related refundable investment tax credits  with the exception of non refundable advanced payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development  which are capitalized in accordance with asc  research and development and included within other assets 
clinical trial expenses are a component of research and development costs 
these expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations and investigators and other service providers  which conduct certain product development activities on our behalf 
the company uses an accrual basis of accounting  based upon estimates of the amount of service completed 
in the event payments differ from the amount of service completed  prepaid expense or accrued liabilities amounts are adjusted on the balance sheet 
these expenses are based on estimates of the work performed under service agreements  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and experience with similar contracts 
the company monitors each of these factors to the extent possible and adjusts estimates accordingly 

table of contents stock based compensation effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of the asc  stock compensation  using the modified prospective method with respect to options granted to employees and directors 
under this transition method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date for all share based payments granted after january  and for all awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january  the expense is amortized on a straight line basis over the graded vesting period 
short term investments short term investments consist of financial instruments purchased with an original maturity of greater than three months and less than one year 
the company considers its short term investments as available for sale and they are carried at market value with unrealized gains and losses  if any  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  which is a separate component of shareholders equity 
realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities are recognized in net loss 
the cost of investments sold is based on the specific identification method 
fair value of financial instruments the fair value of the company s cash equivalents and marketable securities is based on quoted market prices and trade data for comparable securities 
other financial instruments including amounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  are carried at cost  which the company believes approximates fair value because of the short term maturities of these instruments 
recent accounting pronouncements there were no recent accounting pronouncements which the company expects would have any impact on the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  primarily in short term bank deposits  money market funds  and domestic and foreign commercial paper and government securities 
these investments are denominated in us dollars and are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
for example  if market rates hypothetically increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels at december   the decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be material 
foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency transactions on certain contracts and payroll expenses related to our canadian subsidiary  oncogenex technologies  denominated in canadian dollars and we have not hedged these amounts 
as our unhedged foreign currency transactions fluctuate  our earnings might be negatively affected 
accordingly  changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar might have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition  and fluctuations in exchange rates might harm our reported results and accounts from period to period
