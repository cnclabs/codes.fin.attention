item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading risk factors 
overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets an insulin infusion system for people with insulin dependent diabetes 
our proprietary omnipod insulin management system consists of our omnipod disposable insulin infusion device and our handheld  wireless personal diabetes manager 
the us food and drug administration  or fda  approved the omnipod system in january in october  we shipped our first commercial omnipod system 
we have progressively expanded our marketing efforts from an initial focus in the eastern united states to having availability of the omnipod system in the entire united states 
in january  we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with ypsomed distribution ag  or ypsomed  which intends to distribute and sell our omnipod system in eleven countries  beginning with france  germany and the united kingdom in the first half of  subject to approved reimbursement 
we focus our sales towards key diabetes practitioners  academic centers and clinics specializing in the treatment of diabetes patients  as well as individual diabetes patients 
our total revenue was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we are currently producing the omnipod on a partially automated manufacturing line at a facility in china operated by a subsidiary of flextronics international ltd 
we purchase complete omnipods pursuant to our agreement with flextronics 
under the agreement  flextronics has agreed to supply us  as a non exclusive supplier  with omnipods at agreed upon prices per unit pursuant to a rolling month forecast that we provide to flextronics 
the initial term of the agreement is three years from january   with automatic one year renewals 
the agreement may be terminated at any time by either party upon prior written notice given no less than a specified number of days prior to the date of termination 
the specified number of days is intended to provide the parties with sufficient time to make alternative arrangements in the event of termination 
by purchasing omnipods manufactured by flextronics in china  we have been able to substantially increase production volumes for the omnipod and reduce our per unit production cost 
as a medical device company  reimbursement from third party payors is an important element of our success 
if patients are not adequately reimbursed for the costs of using the omnipod system  it will be much more difficult for us to penetrate the market 
we continue to negotiate contracts establishing reimbursement 
table of contents for the omnipod system with national and regional third party payors  and we believe that substantially all of the units sold have been reimbursed by third party payors  subject to applicable deductible and co payment amounts 
as we expand our sales and marketing focus  increase our manufacturing capacity and expand to international markets  we will need to maintain and expand available reimbursement for the omnipod system 
since our inception in  we have incurred losses every quarter 
in the years ended december   and  we incurred net losses of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have financed our operations through the private placement of equity securities  public offerings of our common stock  a private placement of our convertible debt and borrowings under certain debt agreements 
as of december   we had million of convertible debt outstanding and million of outstanding debt relating to a facility agreement entered into march  and amended on september  since inception  we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock  common stock and debt 
in may  in our initial public offering  we issued and sold  shares of common stock to the public at a price of per share 
in june  we issued and sold an additional  shares of common stock to the public at a price of per share pursuant to the underwriters partial exercise of their over allotment option 
in connection with the initial public offering  including the partial exercise of the over allotment option  we received total gross proceeds of million  or approximately million of net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
in november  in a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share by certain of our stockholders  we issued and sold an additional  shares of common stock at the public offering price pursuant to the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option

we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders 
in june  we sold million principal amount of convertible senior notes due june  the notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the interest rate on the notes is per annum on the principal amount from june   payable semi annually in arrears in cash on december and june of each year  beginning december  the notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
in connection with the private placement of our convertible debt  we received total gross proceeds of million  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and offering expenses 
in march  we entered into a facility agreement with certain institutional accredited investors  pursuant to which the investors agreed to loan us up to million  subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the facility agreement 
upon execution of this facility agreement  we issued to the lenders warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share in connection with the initial million draw down from the facility 
in september  we entered into an amendment to the facility agreement whereby we repaid the million of outstanding debt and promptly drew down the remaining million available under the facility agreement 
the lender agreed to eliminate all performance milestones associated with the remaining million available on the credit facility and reduced the annual interest rate on any borrowed funds to 
all principal amounts outstanding under the facility agreement are payable in september in addition  the lender agreed to forego the remaining warrants to purchase an additional million shares of common stock that would have been issued upon future draws 
in connection with the amendment to the facility agreement  we entered into a securities purchase agreement with the lenders whereby we sold  shares of our common stock to the lenders at per share 
we received aggregate proceeds of million in connection with the sale of our shares 
in october  in a public offering  we issued and sold  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
in november  we issued and sold an additional  shares of 
table of contents common stock to the public at a price of per share pursuant to the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option 
in connection with the offering  we received total gross proceeds of million  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
our long term financial objective is to achieve and sustain profitable growth 
our efforts for will be focused primarily on continuing to reduce our per unit production costs  expanding sales to international markets and reducing our spending on manufacturing overhead and operating expenses 
the continued expansion of our manufacturing capacity will help us to achieve lower material costs due to volume purchase discounts and improved absorption of manufacturing overhead costs  reducing our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue 
achieving these objectives is expected to require additional investments in certain personnel and initiatives to allow for us to increase our market penetration in the united states market and enter certain international markets 
we believe that we will continue to incur net losses in the near term in order to achieve these objectives 
however  we believe that the accomplishment of our near term objectives will have a positive impact on our financial condition in the future 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  together with the cash to be generated from expected product sales  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and debt service requirements through at least the end of facility agreement and common stock warrants on march   we entered into a facility agreement with certain institutional accredited investors  pursuant to which the investors agreed to loan us up to million  subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the facility agreement 
following the initial disbursement of million on march   we could  but were not required to  draw down on the facility in million increments at any time until november provided that we met certain financial performance milestones 
in connection with this financing  we paid deerfield management company  lp  an affiliate of the lead lender  a one time transaction fee of million 
total financing costs  including the transaction fee  were million and were being amortized as interest expense over the month term of the facility agreement 
the amounts initially drawn under the facility agreement accrued interest at a rate of per annum  and the undrawn amounts under the facility agreement accrued interest at a rate of per annum 
accrued interest is payable quarterly in cash in arrears beginning on june  we had the right to prepay any amounts owed without penalty unless the prepayment was in connection with a major transaction 
on september   we entered into an amendment to the facility agreement whereby we repaid the million of outstanding debt and promptly drew down the remaining million available under the facility agreement 
the lender eliminated all future performance milestones associated with the remaining million available on the credit facility and reduced the annual interest rate on any borrowed funds to 
in connection with the amendment to the facility agreement  we entered into a securities purchase agreement with the lenders whereby we sold  shares of our common stock to the lenders at per share 
we received aggregate proceeds of million in connection with the sale of our shares 
all subsequent references to the facility agreement refer to the facility agreement entered into on march  and amended on september  all principal amounts outstanding under the facility agreement are payable in september any amounts drawn under the facility agreement may become immediately due and payable upon i an event of default  as defined in the facility agreement  in which case the lenders would have the right to require us to re pay of the principal amount of the loan  plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon  or ii the consummation of certain change of control transactions  in which case the lenders would have the right to require us to re pay of the outstanding principal amount of the loan  plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon 
the facility agreement also provides for higher interest rates to be paid by us in certain events 

table of contents because the consummation of certain change in control transactions would result in the payment of a premium of the outstanding principal  the premium feature is a derivative that is required to be bifurcated from the host debt instrument and recorded at fair value at each quarter end 
as a higher interest rate could be paid by us upon the occurrence of certain events  the higher interest feature is also considered a derivative 
the higher interest payment does not meet the criteria to be accounted for separately 
any changes in fair value of the premium feature will be recorded as interest expense 
the difference between the face value of the outstanding principal on the facility agreement and the amount remaining after the bifurcation will be recorded as a discount to be amortized over the term of the facility agreement 
at december   the premium feature associated with the facility agreement had no value as we do not currently expect a change in control transaction to occur 
the embedded derivatives related to the facility agreement will be reassessed and marked to market through earnings on a quarterly basis 
as of december   million of outstanding debt related to the facility agreement is included in long term debt in the consolidated balance sheet 
approximately million of interest expense was recorded in the year ended december  of the million recorded in the year ended december   approximately million relates to cash interest  million relates to amortization of the debt discount and deferred financing costs and million relates to the charge taken for the unamortized portion of the debt discount and deferred financing costs in connection with the repayment and termination of the initial disbursement 
of the million of interest expense related to the extinguishment of the debt  million relates to the debt discount for the unamortized balance of the fair value of the warrants issued on march  and the transaction fee paid to the lenders and million related to the remaining deferred financing costs 
on march   in connection with the execution of the facility agreement  we issued to the lenders fully exercisable warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
pursuant to the original terms of the facility agreement  we would have been required to issue additional warrants to purchase million shares upon drawing down the remaining million under the facility 
in connection with the amendment to the facility agreement in september  the lenders agreed to forego the remaining million additional warrants that would have been issued upon future draws 
if we issue or sell shares of our common stock other than i pursuant to a registered public offering or shelf takedown  ii in a transaction that does not require shareholder approval  iii to partners in connection with a joint venture  distribution or other partnering arrangement in a transaction that does not require shareholder approval  iv upon the exercise of options granted to our employees  officers  directors and consultants  v of restricted stock to  or purchases of  our common stock under our employee stock purchase plan by employees  officers  directors or consultants or vi upon the exercise of the warrants after march   we will issue concurrently therewith additional warrants to purchase such number of shares of common stock as will entitle the lenders to maintain the same beneficial ownership in us after the issuance as they had prior to such issuance  as adjusted on a pro rata basis for repayments of the outstanding principal amount under the loan  with such warrants being issued at an exercise price equal to the greater of per share and the closing price of the common stock on the date immediately prior to the issuance 
all warrants issued under the facility agreement remain unexercised as of december   expire on march  and contain certain limitations that prevent the holder from acquiring shares upon exercise of a warrant that would result in the number of shares beneficially owned by it to exceed of the total number of shares of our common stock then issued and outstanding 
in addition  upon certain change of control transactions  or upon certain events of default as defined in the warrant agreement  the holder has the right to net exercise the warrants for an amount of shares of our common stock equal to the black scholes value of the shares issuable under the warrants divided by of the closing price of the common stock on the day immediately prior to the consummation of such change of control or event of default  as applicable 
in certain circumstances where a warrant or portion of a warrant is not net exercised in connection with a change of control or event of default  the holder will be paid an amount in cash equal to the black scholes value of such portion of the warrant not treated as a net exercise 

table of contents the warrants issued in connection with the facility agreement qualify for permanent classification as equity and their relative fair value of million on the issuance date was recorded as additional paid in capital and debt discount 
the remaining unamortized value of the warrants was recorded as interest expense in the year ended december   in connection with the repayment and termination of the initial disbursement 
convertible notes and repayment and termination of term loan in june  we sold million principal amount of convertible senior notes due june  the notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the interest rate on the notes is per annum on the principal amount from june   payable semi annually in arrears in cash on december and june of each year  beginning december  the notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  representing a conversion premium of to the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on june   subject to adjustment under certain circumstances  at any time beginning on march  or under certain other circumstances and prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the final maturity date of the notes 
the notes will be convertible for cash up to their principal amount and shares of our common stock for the remainder of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount 
we do not have the right to redeem any of the notes prior to maturity 
if a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture for the notes  occurs at any time prior to maturity  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase their notes in whole or in part for cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest  including any additional interest  to  but excluding  the date of repurchase 
if a holder elects to convert its notes upon the occurrence of a make whole fundamental change  as defined in the indenture for the notes  the holder may be entitled to receive an additional number of shares of common stock on the conversion date 
these additional shares are intended to compensate the holders for the loss of the time value of the conversion option  and are set forth in the indenture for the notes 
in no event will the shares issuable upon conversion of a note exceed per  principal amount subject to adjustment as described in the indenture for the notes 
we adopted certain provisions of fasb asc debt with conversion and other options  on january  fasb asc clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion should be separated between the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
these provisions of fasb asc were applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
accordingly  we recorded a debt discount of million to equity to reflect the value of our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of per annum 
the million represents the difference between our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate and the stated rate on the notes 
this debt discount is being amortized as interest expense beginning june  over the year term of the notes 
we incurred interest expense of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to the notes 
of the million recorded in the year ended december   approximately million relates to additional interest expense recognized under these provisions of fasb asc of the million recorded in the year ended december   approximately million relates to additional interest expense recognized under these provisions of fasb asc we incurred deferred financing costs related to this offering of approximately million  of which million has been reclassified as an offset to the amount allocated to equity 
the remainder is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet and is being amortized as a component of interest expense over the five year term of the notes 
as of december   the outstanding amounts related to the notes of million are included in long term debt in the consolidated balance sheet and reflect the debt discount of million 
as 
table of contents of december   the outstanding amounts related to the notes of million are included in long term debt and have been retroactively restated as required by fasb asc to reflect the debt discount of million 
the debt discount represents the difference between our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate and the stated rate on the notes and includes the equity allocation of million which represents million less the million of allocated financing costs offset by the accretion of the debt discount through interest expense from the issuance date in over the year term of the notes 
we recorded million of interest expense related to the debt discount in the year ended december  as of december   the notes have a remaining life of years 
the statement of operations for the periods subsequent to the debt issuance on june   has been retroactively restated to reflect the additional interest expense pursuant to fasb asc we recorded million of interest expense related to the debt discount in the year ended december  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the notes offering 
approximately million of the net proceeds from this offering was used to repay and terminate our then existing term loan  including outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest of million  a prepayment fee related to the term loan of approximately million and a termination fee of million 
we are using the remainder for general corporate purposes 
we incurred interest expense of approximately million and million on the term loan for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we incurred no interest on the term loan in the year ended december  the term loan was subject to a loan origination fee of million  which was recorded in the consolidated balance sheet and was being amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the loan 
the remaining balance of deferred financing costs of approximately million was written off at the repayment and termination date 
in connection with this term loan  we issued warrants to the lenders to purchase up to  shares of series e preferred stock at a purchase price of per share 
the warrants automatically converted into warrants to purchase common stock on a for basis at a purchase price of per share at the closing of our initial public offering in may we recorded the million fair value of the warrants as a discount to the term loan 
upon repayment and termination of the term loan  we recognized approximately million as interest expense for the unamortized balance of the warrants fair value 
the difference between the amount paid  including the prepayment fee  and the carrying value of the term loan  including the remaining deferred financing costs and unamortized warrants to purchase common stock  was recognized as a million loss from early extinguishment of the term loan 
financial operations overview revenue 
revenue is recognized in accordance with fasb asc  revenue recognition  and fasb asc  revenue multiple element arrangements 
we derive most of our revenue from the sale of the omnipod system directly to patients and third party distributors who resell the product to diabetes patients 
the omnipod system is comprised of two devices the omnipod  a disposable insulin infusion device that the patient wears for up to three days and then replaces  and the personal diabetes manager  or pdm  a handheld device much like a personal digital assistant that wirelessly programs the omnipod with insulin delivery instructions  assists the patient with diabetes management and incorporates a blood glucose meter 
revenue is derived from the sale to new customers or third party distributors of omnipods and starter kits  which include the pdm  the omnipod system user guide and our interactive training cd  and from the subsequent sales of omnipods to existing customers 
customers generally order a three month supply of omnipods 
during the years ended december   and  materially all of our revenue was derived from sales within the united states 
in march  we received a cash payment from abbott diabetes care  inc abbott for an agreement fee in connection with execution of the first amendment to the development and license agreement with abbott 
we recognize the payment as revenue over the year term of the agreement 
under the amended abbott agreement  beginning july   abbott agreed to pay us an amount for services performed by us in connection with each sale of a pdm that includes an abbott discrete blood glucose monitor to a new customer 
we recognize the revenue related to this portion of the abbott agreement at the time the revenue is recognized on the sale of the pdm to the patient 
in the years ended december  and  we 
table of contents recognized million and million of revenue  respectively  related to the amended abbott agreement 
there was no impact to cost of revenue related to this agreement 
as of december  and  we had deferred revenue of million and million  respectively  which includes the deferred revenue related to the agreement fee received under the first amendment to our development agreement with abbott 
for the year ending december   we expect our revenue to continue to increase as we continue to gain new diabetes patients in the united states and expand to certain international markets 
increased revenue will be dependent upon the success of our sales efforts  our ability to produce omnipods in sufficient volumes and other risks and uncertainties 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of raw material  labor  warranty and overhead costs related to the omnipod system 
cost of revenue also includes depreciation  freight and packaging costs 
the increase in our omnipod manufacturing capacity  as well as our ability to gain cost savings on our bill of materials  is expected to reduce the per unit cost of manufacturing the omnipods by allowing us to reduce our direct costs and spread our fixed and semi fixed overhead costs over a greater number of units 
however  if sales volumes do not increase  then the average cost of revenue per omnipod may not decrease and we may incur gross losses 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs within our product development  regulatory and clinical functions  and the costs of market studies and product development projects 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
for the fiscal year  we expect overall research and development spending to be in line with levels as we support our current research and development efforts  which are focused primarily on increased functionality  improved design for ease of use and reduction of production cost  as well as developing a new omnipod system that incorporates continuous glucose monitoring technology 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs within our sales  marketing  reimbursement support  customer support and training functions  sales commissions paid to our sales representatives and costs associated with participation in medical conferences  physician symposia and promotional activities  including distribution of units used in our demonstration kit programs 
in the year ending december   we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase slightly compared to as we align our sales and marketing efforts with our expanding business needs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving the executive  finance  information technology and human resource functions  as well as legal fees  accounting fees  insurance costs  bad debt expenses  shipping  handling and facilities related costs 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease slightly in compared to as we continue to drive efficiencies in our administrative functions 
restructuring expenses and impairments of assets 
in connection with our efforts to pursue improved gross margins  leverage operational efficiencies and better pursue opportunities for low cost supplier sourcing of asset costs  we periodically perform an evaluation of our manufacturing processes and review the carrying value of our property and equipment to assess the recoverability of these assets and determine whether impairment may have occurred 
as part of this assessment  we review the planned use of the assets as well as the future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated by those assets 
if impairment is indicated through this review  the carrying amount of the asset would be reduced to its estimated fair value 
this review of manufacturing processes and equipment can result in restructuring activity or an impairment of assets based on current net book value and potential future use of the assets 
we recorded asset impairment charges of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
no asset impairment charges were recorded in the year ended december  our restructuring expenses may also include workforce reduction and related costs for one time termination benefits provided to employees who are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement 
we record these one time termination benefits upon incurring the liability provided that 
table of contents the employees are notified  the plan is approved by the appropriate level of management  the employees to be terminated and the expected completion date are identified and the benefits the identified employees will be paid are established 
significant changes to the plan are not expected when we record the costs 
in recording the workforce reduction and related costs  we estimate related costs such as taxes and outplacement services which may be provided under the plan 
if changes in these estimated services occur  we may be required to record or reverse restructuring expenses associated with these workforce reduction and related costs 
restructuring and impairment of assets includes workforce related charges of million in the year ended december  no workforce related charges were included in our restructuring and impairment of assets in the years ended december  and in the year ended december   we recorded a charge to operating expenses of million for workforce reduction and related costs as part of our continued focus on aligning our infrastructure 
at december   we had accrued severance of approximately million related to this charge 
stock based compensation expense 
prior to january   we accounted for our stock based awards using the minimum value method of accounting 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  using the prospective method

table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and december  revenue our total revenue was million for year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is due to the increase in the number of diabetes patients using the omnipod system as well as increased volume with third party distributors who resell our product to diabetes patients 
cost of revenue cost of revenue was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to increased sales volume partially offset by lower per unit costs 
lower per unit cost is a result of cost savings on raw materials  volume discounts from our suppliers and increased production volumes 
revenue increased by from the year ended december  to the year ended december   while cost of revenue increased by only in the same period mainly due to the reduction in cost per omnipod 
research and development research and development expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december  the increase in expense was primarily related to increased severance expense of million offset by a million decrease in products used for research and development purposes 
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the increase in expense was primarily due to an increase of million in employee related expenses mainly related to increased bonuses of million and stock based compensation of million  an increase of million related to allowances for doubtful accounts and an increase of million in license fees 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in depreciation expense and a million decrease in freight expense 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in expense for the year ended december   was primarily due to a million reduction in patient demonstration kit units and a reduction of million in advertising  promotion and tradeshow expenses used to support our selling efforts 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million in employee related expenses  primarily due to increasing commissions as a result of our increasing revenue  and a million increase in outside services 
restructuring and impairment of assets we had no restructuring or impairment activity in the year ended december  for the year ended december   our restructuring expenses and impairment of assets was million 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million for the impairment of certain manufacturing equipment no longer in use as well as workforce reduction and related costs 
as part of the our strategic goal to pursue improved gross margins  leverage operational efficiencies and better pursue opportunities for low cost supplier sourcing  we transitioned the manufacturing of completed omnipods to flextronics international ltd  located in china 
we determined that we would no longer use certain manufacturing equipment located in our bedford facility 
in addition  this transition resulted in a reduction in workforce of approximately employees  mainly in the manufacturing and quality departments 
as a result of these actions  we recorded 
table of contents a non cash charge of million related to impairments of assets as well as million in workforce and related charges in as of december   our accrued restructuring was million for final payments of severance and was fully utilized during we had no accrued restructuring expense as of december  the following is a summary of restructuring activity for the year ended december  and year ended december  in thousands balance at the beginning of year restructuring expense utilization balance at the end of the year other income expense interest income was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease of million compared to the year ended december   caused primarily by lower cash balances and interest rates 
interest income was earned from cash deposits and short term interest bearing instruments 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this represents an increase of million compared to the year ended december  the increase in interest expense is primarily a result of additional interest incurred on the notes  the retrospective adoption of fasb asc and interest incurred on the facility agreement entered into in march and amended in september we recorded interest expense on the notes of million in the year ended december  of the million  million related to interest recognized under the provisions of fasb asc and million related to cash interest

comparison of the years ended december  and december  revenue our total revenue was million for year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is due to the increase in the number of diabetes patients using the omnipod system as well as relationships with third party distributors who resell our product to diabetes patients 
cost of revenue cost of revenue was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to increased sales volume partially offset by lower per unit costs 
cost of revenue included adjustment of inventory to the lower of cost or market and indirect costs 
since the omnipods were sold at a price below direct manufacturing costs in  the inventory adjustment made as of december  increased cost of revenue by million 
there was no adjustment made as of december  this was a result of a reduced cost of raw materials and increased volumes 
table of contents which improved the absorption of manufacturing overhead costs 
during the third quarter of  we incurred production costs for the omnipod which were lower than its selling price  primarily due to increased production volumes of the omnipod which improved positive gross margin on sales of our omnipod system 
research and development research and development expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december  the increase in expense was primarily attributable to an increase of million in employee related expenses  million in consulting services  million in tools and supplies  offset by a million decrease in prototype and other expenses 
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the increase in expense was primarily due to an increase of million in employee related expenses primarily with respect to the hiring of additional employees  million related to allowances for doubtful accounts  million in consulting related expenses  million in increased depreciation expense  million for travel expenses and million in increased freight expense

we determined that we would no longer use certain manufacturing equipment located in our bedford facility 
in addition  this transition resulted in a reduction in workforce of approximately employees  mainly in the manufacturing and quality departments 
as a result of these actions  we recorded a non cash charge of million related to impairments of assets as well as million in workforce and related charges 
employees terminated were mainly in the manufacturing and quality departments 
in addition  certain members of senior management were terminated 
this reduction was primarily in response to our successful transition of portions of the manufacturing process to flextronics as well as on going alignment of our infrastructure 
during the third quarter of  we successfully transitioned our production of completed omnipods to the manufacturing line operated by flextronics 
pursuant to our agreement with flextronics  flextronics will supply  as a non exclusive supplier  omnipods at agreed upon prices per unit pursuant to a rolling month forecast provided by us 
the initial term of the agreement is three years from january   with automatic one year renewals 
the agreement may be terminated at any time by either party upon prior written notice given no less than a specified number of days prior to the date of termination 
we continue to manufacture certain sub assemblies and maintain packaging operations in our bedford  massachusetts facility 

table of contents we ceased to use certain assets in our bedford facility in connection with the transition of manufacturing to flextronics 
we continued to evaluate flextronics ability to manufacture completed omnipods against the rolling forecast as well as anticipated capacity and demand throughout the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter we concluded that the capacity of the manufacturing line operated by flextronics was considered adequate to meet anticipated demand and quality standards 
as we determined that we would no longer use the bedford equipment on december   we recorded an impairment charge for the remaining net book value of the assets of million on that date 
the equipment had no expected salvage value as it was highly customized equipment that can only be used for the manufacture of omnipods 
during the year ended december   we completed the evaluation of an upgrade of our manufacturing processes 
the upgrade of our product design and associated manufacturing processes were aimed at achieving lower per unit costs 
as a result  we performed a review of certain production equipment 
the review resulted in a non cash charge of million for the write down of certain impaired assets 
the impaired assets  which had no future use  consisted of manufacturing equipment 
the impairment charges were recorded following determination of the fair value of cash flows resulting from use of the affected assets  and the carrying value of the assets has been reduced to reflect their fair value 
other income expense interest income was million for the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  this represents a decrease of million compared to the year ended december   caused primarily by lower cash balances and interest rates 
interest income was earned from cash deposits and short term interest bearing instruments 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this represents an increase of million compared to the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was attributable to higher debt levels under our million term loan  interest on the notes  and the retrospective adoption of fasb asc upon the closing of our initial public offering in may  all outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our preferred stock were converted into warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the aggregate fair value of these warrants as of may   determined to be million  was reclassified from liabilities to additional paid in capital  a component of stockholders equity  and we have ceased to record any related periodic fair value adjustments 
as a result of the determination of fair value  we recorded other expenses of approximately million in the year ended december   as the aggregate fair value of warrants decreased from the value recorded at march  the decrease in fair value was primarily caused by a lower expected life for the warrants  considering the existence of a market for our company s common stock 
liquidity and capital resources we commenced operations in  and  to date  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock  secured indebtedness and our initial public offering of our common stock in may and subsequent public offerings of our common stock in november and october since inception  we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock  common stock and debt 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
in october  in a public offering  we issued and sold  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
in connection with the offering  we received total gross proceeds of million  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
in march  we entered into a facility agreement with certain institutional accredited investors  pursuant to which the investors agreed to loan us up to million  subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the facility agreement 
following the initial disbursement of million on march   we could  but were not required to  draw down on the facility in million increments at any time until november provided that we met certain financial performance milestones 
in connection with this 
table of contents financing  we paid deerfield management company  lp  an affiliate of the lead lender  a one time transaction fee of million 
total financing costs  including the transaction fee were million 
the amounts initially drawn under the facility agreement accrued interest at a rate of per annum  and the undrawn amounts under the facility agreement accrued interest at a rate of per annum 
accrued interest is payable quarterly in cash in arrears beginning on june  we had the right to prepay any amounts owed without penalty unless the prepayment was in connection with a major transaction 
in september  we entered into an amendment to the facility agreement whereby we repaid the million of outstanding debt and promptly drew down the remaining million available under the facility agreement 
the lender eliminated all future performance related milestones associated with the remaining million available on the credit facility and reduced the annual interest rate on any borrowed funds to 
in connection with the amendment to the facility agreement  we entered into a securities purchase agreement with the lenders whereby we sold  shares of our common stock to the lenders at per share 
we received aggregate proceeds of million in connection with the sale of our shares 
all principal amounts outstanding under the facility agreement are payable in september in june  we sold million principal amount of convertible senior notes due june  the notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the interest rate on the notes is per annum on the principal amount from june   payable semi annually in arrears in cash on december and june of each year  beginning december  the notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  representing a conversion premium of to the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on june   per  principal amount of the notes  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances  at any time beginning on march  or under certain other circumstances and prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the final maturity date of the notes 
the notes will be convertible for cash up to their principal amount and shares of our common stock for the remainder of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount 
we do not have the right to redeem any of the notes prior to maturity 
if a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture for the notes  occurs at any time prior to maturity  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase their notes in whole or in part for cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest  including any additional interest  to  but excluding  the date of repurchase 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from this offering 
in june  we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay the entire outstanding principal balance  plus accrued and unpaid interest  under our then existing term loan in the aggregate of approximately million 
additionally  we paid a prepayment fee related to the term loan of approximately million  a termination fee related to the term loan of million  and incurred certain other expenses related to the repayment and termination of the term loan 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  together with the cash to be generated from expected product sales  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and debt service requirements through at least the end of the following table sets forth the amounts of cash used in operating activities and net loss for each of the periods indicated year ended december  restated in thousands cash used in operating activities net loss net cash used in operating activities primarily represents funds utilized in the development and commercialization of the omnipod system 
the decrease of million in cash used in operating activities 
table of contents for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due primarily to the increase in our business  our ability to generate gross margins in and cost containment initiatives implemented as we strive to become profitable 
cash used in operations in the year ended december  is primarily a result of our net loss of million offset by non cash items such as depreciation and bad debt expense and includes an increase in net accounts receivable of million  partially offset by a decrease in inventory of million  a decrease in prepaids and other current assets of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and an increase in deferred revenue of million 
the increase in accounts receivable balance is related to increased sales and slower than expected collections 
the decrease in inventory is a result of increased demand from our growing customer base offset by improved manufacturing capacity 
the following table sets forth the amounts of cash used in investing activities and cash provided by financing activities for each of the periods indicated year ended december  restated in thousands cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities cash used in investing activities was primarily for the purchase of fixed assets for use in the development and manufacturing of the omnipod system in the years ended december   and cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december   was primarily generated from the net proceeds from the facility agreement entered into in march and amended in september  the sale of common shares in connection with the amendment in september and the sale of  shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share in october cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was primarily a result of the private placement of our convertible debt in cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was primarily a result of offerings of our common stock in we lease our facilities  which are accounted for as operating leases 
the leases of our facilities in bedford and billerica  massachusetts  generally provide for a base rent plus real estate taxes and certain operating expenses related to the lease 
all operating leases contain renewal options and escalating payments over the life of the lease 
as of december   we had an outstanding letter of credit which totaled million to cover our security deposits for lease obligations 
during the year ending december   we will be expending funds in connection with  among other things  our efforts to increase our production capacity  improve our design for ease of use  develop a new omnipod system that incorporate continuous glucose monitoring technology and expand our sales and marketing activities to international markets 
shareholder rights plan in november  our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan  as set forth in the shareholder rights agreement between us and the rights agent  the purpose of which is  among other things  to enhance the board s ability to protect shareholder interests and to ensure that shareholders receive fair treatment in the event any coercive takeover attempt of us is made in the future 
the shareholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or could discourage a third party from acquiring  us or a large block of our common stock 
in connection with the adoption of the shareholder rights plan  our board of directors declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right a right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on november  in addition  one right will automatically attach to each share of common stock issued between november  and the distribution date 
the rights currently are not exercisable and are attached to and trade with the outstanding shares of common stock 
under the shareholder rights plan  the rights become exercisable if a person or group becomes an acquiring person by acquiring or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or if a 
table of contents person or group commences a tender offer that would result in that person owning or more of the common stock 
if a person or group becomes an acquiring person  each holder of a right other than the acquiring person would be entitled to purchase  at the then current exercise price  such number of shares of our preferred stock which are equivalent to shares of common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the right 
if we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after any such event  each holder of a right would then be entitled to purchase  at the then current exercise price  shares of the acquiring company s common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the right 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december  amounts in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations long term debt obligations purchase obligations for production components purchase obligations for capital expenditures total contractual obligations the interest rate on the convertible debt is per annum  and the interest rate on amounts outstanding under the facility agreement entered into in march and amended in september is 
we have included future payments of interest on the long term debt in our obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
we adopted the financial accounting standard board accounting standards codification in the year ended december  the fasb accounting standards codification codification has become the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap 
all existing accounting standard documents are superseded by the codification and any accounting literature not included in the codification will not be authoritative 
however  rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec issued under the authority of federal securities laws will continue to be sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all references made to gaap in our consolidated financial statements now use the new codification numbering system 
the codification does not change or alter existing gaap and  therefore  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we generate nearly all of our revenue from sales of our omnipod insulin management system to diabetes patients or third party distributors who resell the product to diabetes patients 
the initial sale to a new customer typically includes omnipods and a starter kit  which include the pdm  the omnipod system user guide and the omnipod system interactive training cd 
we offer a day right of return for our starter kits sales 
subsequent sales to existing customers typically consist of additional omnipods 
revenue is recognized in accordance with fasb asc revenue recognition  which requires that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery of goods occurs through transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
with respect to these criteria the evidence of an arrangement generally consists of a physician order form  a patient information form  and if applicable  third party insurance approval for sales directly to patients or a purchase order for sales to a third party distributor 
transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership are typically passed to the patient or third party distributor upon shipment of the products 
the selling prices for all sales are fixed and agreed with the patient or third party distributor  and if applicable  the patient s third party insurance provider s prior to shipment and are based on established list prices or  in the case of certain third party insurers  contractually agreed upon prices 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are established as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we have considered the requirements of fasb asc revenue multiple element arrangements  when accounting for the omnipods and starter kits 
fasb asc requires that we assess whether the different elements qualify for separate accounting 
we recognize revenue for the initial shipment to a patient or other third party once all elements have been delivered 
we offer a day right of return for our starter kits sales and in accordance with fasb asc  revenue products  we defer revenue to reflect estimated sales returns in the same period that the related product sales are recorded 
returns are estimated through a comparison of historical return data to their related sales 
historical rates of return are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace when appropriate 
historically  sales returns have amounted to approximately of gross product sales 
when doubt exists about reasonable assuredness of collectibility from specific customers  we defer revenue from sales of products to those customers until payment is received 
in march  we received a cash payment from abbott diabetes care  inc abbott for an agreement fee in connection with execution of the first amendment to the development and license agreement between us and abbott 
we recognize the agreement fee received from abbott over the year term of the agreement  and the non current portion of the agreement fee is included in other long term liabilities 
under the amended abbott agreement  beginning july   abbott agreed to pay us an amount for services performed by us in connection with each sale of a pdm that includes an abbott discrete blood glucose monitor to certain customers 
we recognize the revenue related to this portion of the abbott agreement at the time we meet the criteria for revenue recognition  typically at the time the revenue is recognized on the sale of the pdm to the patient 
in the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of revenue related to the amended abbott agreement 
there was no impact to cost of revenue related to this agreement 
restructuring expense and impairment of assets as part of our efforts to pursue improved gross margins  leverage operational efficiencies and better pursue opportunities for low cost supplier sourcing of asset costs  we periodically perform an evaluation of our manufacturing processes and review the carrying value of our property and equipment to assess the recoverability of these assets whenever events indicate that impairment may have occurred 
as part of this 
table of contents assessment  we review the planned use of the assets as well as the future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated by those assets 
if impairment is indicated through this review  the carrying amount of the asset would be reduced to its estimated fair value 
this review of manufacturing processes and equipment can result in restructuring activity or an impairment of assets based on current net book value and potential future use of the assets 
our restructuring expenses may also include workforce reduction and related costs for one time termination benefits provided to employees who are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement 
we record these one time termination benefits upon incurring the liability provided that the employees are notified  the plan is approved by the appropriate level of management  the employees to be terminated and the expected completion date are identified and the benefits the identified employees will be paid are established 
significant changes to the plan are not expected when we record the costs 
in recording the workforce reduction and related costs  we estimate related costs such as taxes and outplacement services which may be provided under the plan 
if changes in these estimated services occur  we may be required to record or reverse restructuring expenses associated with these workforce reduction and related costs 
asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
inventories are held at the lower of their cost or market value 
we periodically review inventories for potential impairment based on quantities on hand and expectations of future use 
property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over their useful life or the life of the lease  whichever is shorter 
we review long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
we also review assets under construction to ensure certainty of their future installation and integration into the manufacturing process 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
we consider various valuation factors  principally planned use of the assets and discounted cash flows  to assess the fair values of long lived assets 
income taxes fasb asc  income taxes  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements 
fasb asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  fasb asc provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the provisions related to accounting for uncertain tax positions is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted these provisions on january  the adoption of these provisions of fasb asc did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
as of december   we have million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded 
as of december   we had no unrecognized tax benefits recorded 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of fasb asc  compensation stock compensation 
fasb asc requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
nonpublic companies that used the minimum value method for either recognition or pro forma disclosures to apply the fair value method under fasb asc using the prospective transition method 
as such  we 
table of contents will continue to apply the minimum value method in future periods to equity awards outstanding that were originally measured using the minimum value method 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of options granted 
we recognize the compensation expense of share based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by the stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
because our initial public offering was completed in may  we do not have sufficient history of market prices of our common stock  and as such we estimate volatility in accordance with securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  or sab  using historical volatilities of comparable public entities 
the expected life of the awards is estimated based on the sec shortcut approach as defined in sab  which is the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of the awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on company history and expectation of paying no dividends 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value the awards on a quarterly basis and if factors change and different assumptions are utilized  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what has been recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
prior to april   the exercise prices for options granted were set by our board of directors based upon guidance set forth by the american institute of certified public accountants in the aicpa technical practice aid 
to that end  the board considered a number of factors in determining the option price  including the following factors prices for our preferred stock  which we had sold to outside investors in arms length transactions  and the rights  preferences and privileges of our preferred stock and common stock in the series a through series e financing  obtaining fda k clearance  launching the omnipod system and achievement of budgeted revenue and results 
in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for our initial public offering  we retrospectively estimated the fair value of our common stock based upon several factors  including the following operating and financial performance  progress and milestones attained in the business  past sales of convertible preferred stock  the results of the retrospective independent valuations  and the expected valuation obtained in an initial public offering 
we believe this to have been a reasonable methodology based on the factors above and based on several arm s length transactions involving our stock supportive of the results produced by this valuation methodology 
warrants in connection with the term loans with lighthouse capital partners in and a group of lenders led by merrill lynch capital in  we issued warrants to the lenders to purchase shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock 
upon the closing of our initial public offering in may  all outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our preferred stock were converted into warrants to purchase shares of our common stock on a for basis at a purchase price of per share and  as a result  are no longer be subject to fsp for periods ended or ending on or after that date 
the aggregate fair value of these warrants as of may   determined to be million  was reclassified from liabilities to additional paid in capital  a component of stockholders equity  and we have ceased to record any related periodic fair value adjustments 
in the year ended december   lighthouse capital partners v  lp exercised their right to convert  warrants into common stock  resulting in the issuance and purchase of  shares of our common stock at per share 
in addition  two members of the group of lenders led by merrill lynch capital 
table of contents exercised their right to convert a total of  warrants into common stock  resulting in the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
we recorded million fair value of the warrants for series e preferred stock as a discount to the term loan with merrill lynch capital 
the value of the warrants was being amortized to interest expense over the month life of this term loan 
upon repayment and termination of the term loan in june  we recognized approximately million as interest expense for the unamortized balance of the warrants fair value 
in connection with the million initial disbursement related to the execution of the facility agreement in march  we issued to the lenders fully exercisable warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we recorded million fair value as additional paid in capital and debt discount 
the unamortized value of the warrants was recorded as interest expense in the third quarter of  in connection with the repayment and termination of the initial disbursement 
significant terms and fair values of warrants to purchase common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock are as follows in thousands except share and per share data exercise common shares as of fair value as of expiration price december  december  december  december  stock date per share series e preferred december    common stock march   allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due from third party payors  patients and third party distributors 
we account for doubtful accounts using the allowance method 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded in the period in which the revenue is recorded or at the time the potential collection risk is identified 
we estimate our allowance based on historical experience  assessment of specific risk  discussions with individual customers or various assumptions and estimates that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
at december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million  respectively 
we believe the reserve is adequate to mitigate current collection risk 
warranty we provide a four year warranty on our pdms and may replace any omnipods that do not function in accordance with product specifications 
we estimate our warranty at the time the product is shipped based on historical experience and the estimated cost to service the claims 
cost to service the claims reflects the current product cost which has been decreasing over time 
as these estimates are based on historical experience  and we continue to introduce new products and new versions of existing products  we also consider the anticipated performance of the product over its warranty period in estimating warranty reserves 
adoption of new accounting standards fasb asc debt debt with conversion and other options clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion should be separated between the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
these provisions of fasb asc were applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on prior periods was recognized as of the beginning of the first period presented 
we adopted these provisions of fasb asc as of january  and have reclassified million of our long term debt to equity as of the issuance date of the convertible notes 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of additional interest expense related to these provisions of fasb asc during the year ended december   we recorded million of additional interest expense related to the provisions of fasb asc 
table of contents we adopted certain provisions of fasb asc  subsequent events  as of june  fasb asc provides guidance to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
fasb asc also requires entities to disclose the date through which subsequent events were evaluated as well as the rationale for why that date was selected 
this disclosure should alert all users of financial statements that an entity has not evaluated subsequent events after that date in the set of financial statements being presented 
fasb asc requires additional disclosures only  and therefore did not have an impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts 
our financial instruments consist of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued expenses and long term obligations 
we consider investments that  when purchased  have a remaining maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents 
the primary objectives of our investment strategy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
to minimize our exposure to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest mainly in cash equivalents and short term investments and maintain an average maturity of six months or less 
we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio or our interest income 
on december   we had outstanding debt recorded at million related to our notes and million related to our facility agreement 
as the interest rates on the notes and the facility agreement are fixed  changes in interest rates do not affect the value of our debt or interest expense
