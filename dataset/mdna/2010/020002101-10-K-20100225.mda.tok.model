with regard to funding agreements  we compete principally on the basis of our financial strength and ratings 
the market for life insurance  retirement  and investment products continues to be highly fragmented and competitive 
as of december   there were approximately groups of life insurance companies in the united states  most of which offered one or more similar products 
according to am best  as of december   the allstate financial segment is the nation s th largest issuer of life insurance and related business on the basis of ordinary life insurance in force and th largest on the basis of statutory admitted assets 
in addition  because many of these products include a savings or investment component  our competition includes domestic and foreign securities firms  investment advisors  mutual funds  banks and other financial institutions 
competitive pressure continues to grow due to several factors  including cross marketing alliances between unaffiliated businesses  as well as consolidation activity in the financial services industry 
geographic markets we sell life insurance  retirement and investment  and voluntary accident and health insurance products throughout the united states 
through subsidiaries  we are authorized to sell various types of these products in all states  the district of columbia  puerto rico  the us virgin islands  and guam 
we also sell funding agreements in the united states

reserve for property liability claims and claims expense the following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property liability operations  encompassing both the allstate protection segment and the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
reconciliation of claims reserves the following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves  displayed individually for each of the last three years 
the first table presents reserves on a gross before reinsurance basis 
the end of year gross reserve balances are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial position 
the second table presents reserves on a net after reinsurance basis 
the total net property liability insurance claims and claims expense amounts are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations

the year end gross reserves of billion for property liability insurance claims and claims expense  as determined under gaap  were billion more than the net reserve balance of billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities 
the principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting but are recorded as assets for gaap reporting  and a liability for the reserves of the canadian subsidiaries for billion 
remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between gaap and statutory reporting 
as the tables above illustrate  allstate s net reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of decreased in by million  compared to reestimates of the gross reserves of an increase of million 
net reserve reestimates in  and were more favorable than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance cessions 
loss reserve reestimates the following loss reserve reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years 
the first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year 
the second section  reading down  shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability 
the third section  reading down  shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of allstate s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
the last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established  and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims 
the table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period  with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable 
the loss reserve reestimates table is cumulative and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years

since december  the subsequent cumulative changes in total have generally been favorable other than which was adversely impacted due to litigation filed in conjunction with a louisiana deadline for filing suits related to hurricane katrina 
the following table is derived from the loss reserve reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates  net of reinsurance  on calendar year operations for the ten year period ended december  the total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the reestimates are applicable 
the amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident year s 
favorable reserve reestimates are shown in this table in parentheses 
in millions effect of net reserve reestimates on calendar year operations total by accident year prior total in  favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to allstate protection catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates 
the shift of reserves to older accident years is attributable to a reallocation of reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years  and a reclassification of injury and non injury reserves to older years 
in  unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to allstate protection catastrophe losses that were more than anticipated in previous estimates 
in  favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to allstate protection auto severity development that was less than what was anticipated in previous estimates 
decreased reserve reestimates for allstate protection more than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to environmental liabilities reported by the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
in  and  favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to allstate protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was less than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and in  also by catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates 
decreased reserve reestimates for allstate protection more than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to asbestos liabilities reported by the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
in  unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were due to increases primarily related to asbestos and other discontinued lines  partially offset by favorable allstate protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than previous estimates 
in  unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were due to claim severity and late reported losses for allstate protection that were greater than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and to increased estimates of losses primarily related to asbestos and environmental liabilities in the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
in  unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were due to greater volume of late reported weather related losses than expected from the end of the year which were reported in the year  additional incurred losses on the northridge earthquake  adverse results of class action and other litigation  upward reestimates of property losses and upward reestimates of losses in the encompass and canadian businesses 
favorable calendar year reserve reestimates in were the result of favorable severity trends in each year for allstate protection  which more than offset adverse reestimates in the discontinued lines and coverages segment  primarily for asbestos and environmental liabilities  virtually all of which relates to and prior years 
the favorable severity trend during this period was primarily the result of favorable injury severity trends  as compared to our anticipated trends 
favorable injury severity trends were largely due to more moderate medical cost inflation and the mitigating effects of our loss management programs

regulation allstate is subject to extensive regulation  primarily at the state level 
the method  extent  and substance of such regulation varies by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state regulatory agency 
in general  such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use insurance products issued by our subsidiaries  not the holders of securities issued by the allstate corporation 
these rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters including insurance company licensing and examination  agent and adjuster licensing  price setting  trade practices  policy forms  accounting methods  corporate governance  the nature and amount of investments  claims practices  participation in shared markets and guaranty funds  reserve adequacy  insurer solvency  transactions with affiliates  the payment of dividends  and underwriting standards 
some of these matters are discussed in more detail below 
for a discussion of statutory financial information  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of regulatory contingencies  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
notes and are incorporated in this part i  item by reference 
in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny 
legislation that would provide for increased federal regulation of insurance  including the federal chartering of insurance companies  has been proposed 
moreover  as part of an effort to strengthen the regulation of the financial services market  the federal government has proposed a set of regulatory reforms  including the establishment of an office of national insurance within the treasury department 
the reforms could increase the regulation of large insurance conglomerates whose failure could pose a systemic risk to the financial system 
in addition  state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state insurance regulation 
the federal government has also issued a set of principles for reforming the us and international regulatory capital framework for banking firms 
we cannot predict whether any specific state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance or financial services businesses or what effect any such measures would have on allstate 
we are working for changes in the regulatory environment  including recognizing the need for and improving appropriate risk based pricing and promoting the creation of government sponsored  privately funded solutions for mega catastrophes 
while the actions that we take will be primarily focused on reducing the catastrophe exposure in our property business  we also consider their impact on our ability to market our auto lines 
agent and broker compensation 
in recent years  several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents and brokers by insurance companies 
the proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers 
new disclosure requirements have been imposed in certain circumstances upon some agents and brokers in several states 
limitations on dividends by insurance subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own  the allstate corporation relies on dividends from allstate insurance company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations  including the payment of principal and interest on debt 
allstate insurance company is regulated as an insurance company in illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by illinois law 
for additional information regarding those restrictions  see part ii  item of this report 
the laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our other insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive 
insurance holding company regulation 
the allstate corporation and allstate insurance company are insurance holding companies subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business 
in the us  these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of florida  illinois  massachusetts  nebraska  new york  and texas  and some of these subsidiaries are considered commercially domiciled in california  florida  and utah 
generally  the insurance codes in these states provide that the acquisition or change of control of a domestic or commercially domiciled insurer or of any person that controls such an insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator 
in general  a presumption of control arises from the ownership  control  possession with the power to vote  or possession of proxies with respect to  ten percent or more of the voting securities of an insurer or of a person that controls an insurer 
in addition  certain state insurance laws require pre acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a non domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state 
while such pre acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control  such statutes do authorize certain remedies  including the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the non domestic insurer if certain conditions exist  such as undue market concentration 
thus  any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of the allstate corporation s common stock would generally require prior approval by the state insurance departments in california  illinois  massachusetts  nebraska  new york  texas  and utah 
the prior approval of the florida insurance department would be necessary for the acquisition of five percent or more 
moreover  notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business 
such approval requirements may deter  delay  or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of the allstate corporation s common stock 
price regulation 
nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file price schedules  policy or coverage forms  and other information with the state s regulatory authority 
in many cases  such price schedules  policy forms  or both must be approved prior to use 
while they vary from state to state  the objectives of the pricing laws are generally the same a price cannot be excessive  inadequate  or unfairly discriminatory 
the speed with which an insurer can change prices in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends  in part  on whether the pricing laws are i prior approval  ii file and use  or iii use and file laws 
in states having prior approval laws  the regulator must approve a price before the insurer may use it 
in states having file and use laws  the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator s approval to use a price  but the price must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used 
a use and file law requires an insurer to file prices within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them 
eighteen states  including california and new york  have prior approval laws 
under all three types of pricing laws  the regulator has the authority to disapprove a price subsequent to its filing 
an insurer s ability to adjust its prices in response to competition or to increasing costs is often dependent on an insurer s ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its pricing or proposed pricing meets the requirements of the pricing laws 
in those states that significantly restrict an insurer s discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite  an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance 
in those states that significantly restrict an insurer s ability to charge a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance  the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites 
when a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing  it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability 
changes in allstate s claim settlement process may require allstate to actuarially adjust loss information used in its pricing process 
some state insurance regulatory authorities may not approve price increases that give full effect to these adjustments 
from time to time  the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators  legislators  and special interest groups to reduce  freeze  or set prices at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses 
homeowners insurance comes under similar pressure  particularly as regulators in states subject to high levels of catastrophe losses struggle to identify an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure 
we expect this kind of pressure to persist 
in addition  our use of insurance scoring based on credit report information for underwriting and pricing has been the subject of challenges and investigations by regulators  legislators  and special interest groups 
the result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of the allstate protection segment 
we cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding pricing 
involuntary markets 
as a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states  we are required to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities  and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers 
underwriting results related to these arrangements  which tend to be adverse  have been immaterial to our results of operations 
guaranty funds 
under state insurance guaranty fund laws  insurers doing business in a state can be assessed  up to prescribed limits  in order to cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies 
national flood insurance program 
we voluntarily participate as a write your own carrier in the national flood insurance program nfip 
the nfip is administered and regulated by the federal emergency management agency 
we operate as a fiscal agent of the federal government in the selling and administering of the standard flood insurance policy 
this involves the collection of premiums belonging to the federal government and the paying of covered claims by directly drawing on funds of the united states treasury 
we receive expense allowances from the nfip for underwriting administration  claims management  commissions and adjuster fees 
investment regulation 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit the amount of investment in certain categories 
failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non conforming investments as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus 
further  in some instances  these rules require divestiture of non conforming investments 
exiting geographic markets  canceling and non renewing policies 
most states regulate an insurer s ability to exit a market 
for example  states limit  to varying degrees  an insurer s ability to cancel and non renew policies 
some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
regulations that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer s ability to exit unprofitable markets 
variable life insurance and registered fixed annuities 
the sale and administration of variable life insurance and registered fixed annuities with market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level  including regulation and supervision by the securities and exchange commission and the financial industry regulatory authority finra 
broker dealers  investment advisors  and investment companies 
the allstate entities that operate as broker dealers  registered investment advisors  and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the securities and exchange commission  finra and or  in some cases  state securities administrators 
banking 
the allstate corporation is a diversified unitary savings and loan holding company for allstate bank  a federal stock savings bank and a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the principal supervisory authority for the diversified savings and loan holding company activities and the bank is the office of thrift supervision ots 
we are subject to ots regulation  examination  supervision  and reporting requirements and its enforcement authority 
among other things  this permits the ots to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness  and stability of allstate bank 
the bank is also subject to the authority of the fdic and other federal financial regulators implementing various laws applicable to banking 
privacy regulation 
federal law and the laws of many states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information 
federal law and the laws of many states also regulate disclosures of customer information 
congress  state legislatures  and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information 
asbestos 
congress has considered legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation in the past  but unified support among various defendant and insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking 
we cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos 
environmental 
environmental pollution and clean up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation 
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of superfund and comparable state statutes mini superfund govern the clean up and restoration of waste sites by potentially responsible parties prps 
superfund and the mini superfunds environmental clean up laws or ecls establish a mechanism to assign liability to prps or to fund the clean up of waste sites if prps fail to do so 
the extent of liability to be allocated to a prp is dependent on a variety of factors 
by some estimates  there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean up  but the exact number is unknown 
the extent of clean up necessary and the process of assigning liability remain in dispute 
the insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean up of waste sites by insured prps and the insured parties alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean up 
the insurance industry  including allstate  has disputed and is disputing many such claims 
key coverage issues include whether superfund response  investigation  and clean up costs are considered damages under the policies  trigger of coverage  the applicability of several types of pollution exclusions  proper notice of claims  whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend  appropriate allocation of liability among triggered insurers  and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an occurrence 
identical coverage issues exist for clean up and waste sites not covered under superfund 
to date  courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues 
allstate s exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been  or may be  named as prps is uncertain 
while comprehensive superfund reform proposals have been introduced in congress  only modest reform measures have been enacted 
separately  in  the national association of insurance commissioners naic adopted a model rule that  if adopted by the states  would require insurance companies with annual premiums of at least  to complete an annual survey regarding climate change risks 
we expect most states to require the survey beginning in may the responses will be made available to the public through the naic

however  if the estimates  assumptions or plans underlying the forward looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise  actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward looking statements 
in addition to the normal risks of business  we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including those listed below  which apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other financial services 
these risks constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of and readers should carefully review such cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements and historical trends 
these cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this document  in our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec or in materials incorporated therein by reference 
risks relating to the property liability business as a property and casualty insurer  we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events  our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man made disasters  including earthquakes  volcanoes  wildfires  tornadoes  hurricanes  tropical storms and certain types of terrorism 
we may incur catastrophe losses in our auto and property business in excess of those experienced in prior years those that we project would be incurred based on hurricane and earthquake losses which have a one percent probability of occurring on an annual aggregate countrywide basis those that external modeling firms estimate would be incurred based on other levels of probability the average expected level used in pricing or our current reinsurance coverage limits 
despite our catastrophe management programs  we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on operating results and financial condition 
for example  our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to hurricane katrina in totaling billion  the northridge earthquake of totaling billion and hurricane andrew in totaling billion 
we are also exposed to assessments from the california earthquake authority and various state created catastrophe insurance facilities  and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities 
our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe  or multiple catastrophes  which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings 
in addition  we are subject to claims arising from weather events such as winter storms  rain  hail and high winds 
the incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable 
there is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and property claims when severe weather conditions occur 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted and could be material to our operating results and financial condition along with others in the industry  we use models developed by third party vendors in assessing our property exposure to catastrophe losses 
these models assume various conditions and probability scenarios 
such models do not necessarily accurately predict future losses or accurately measure losses currently incurred 
catastrophe models  which have been evolving since the early s  use historical information about hurricanes and earthquakes and also utilize detailed information about our in force business 
while we use this information in connection with our pricing and risk management activities  there are limitations with respect to its usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting period 
these limitations are evident in significant variations in estimates between models and modelers  material increases and decreases in model results due to changes and refinements of the underlying data elements  assumptions which lead to questionable predictive capability  and actual event conditions that have not been well understood previously and not incorporated into the models 
in addition  the models are not necessarily reflective of actual demand surge  loss adjustment expenses and the occurrence of mold losses  which are subject to wide variation by event or location 
impacts of catastrophes and our catastrophe management strategy may adversely affect premium growth due to our catastrophe risk management efforts  the size of our homeowners business has been negatively impacted and may continue to be negatively impacted if we take further actions 
homeowners premium growth rates and retention could be more adversely impacted than we expect by adjustments to our business structure  size and underwriting practices in markets with significant catastrophe risk exposure 
in addition  due to the diminished potential for cross selling opportunities  new business growth in our auto lines could be lower than expected 
unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our allstate protection segment 
changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy and litigation 
changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs  auto parts prices and used car prices 
changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry  in building materials and in home furnishings  and by other economic and environmental factors  including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes 
however  changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the economy 
increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict 
examples of such events include a decision in by the georgia supreme court which held that diminished value coverage was included in auto policies under georgia law and the emergence of mold related homeowners losses in the state of texas during although we pursue various loss management initiatives in the allstate protection segment in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity  there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity 
our allstate protection segment may experience volatility in claim frequency from time to time  and short term trends may not continue over the longer term 
a spike in gas prices and a significant decline in miles driven  both of which occurred in  are examples of factors contributing to a short term frequency change 
a significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims and may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition recorded claim reserves in the property liability business are based on our best estimates of losses  both reported and incurred but not reported ibnr  after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances 
internal factors are considered including our experience with similar cases  actual claims paid  historical trends involving claim payment patterns  pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs  product mix and contractual terms 
external factors are also considered which include  but are not limited to  law changes  court decisions  changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions 
because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  is an inherently uncertain and complex process 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
predicting claim expense relating to asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines is inherently uncertain and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition the process of estimating asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning  among other things  the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered  or were ever intended to be covered  and whether losses could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium  reinsurance or other contractual agreements 
asbestos related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigation are complex  lengthy proceedings that involve substantial uncertainty for insurers 
actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves may prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss 
ultimate net losses from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
regulation limiting rate increases and requiring us to underwrite business and participate in loss sharing arrangements may adversely effect our operating results and financial condition from time to time  political events and positions affect the insurance market  including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability 
for example  if allstate protection s loss ratio compares favorably to that of the industry  state regulatory authorities may impose rate rollbacks  require us to pay premium refunds to policyholders  or resist or delay our efforts to raise rates even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing regulatory resistance to rate increases 
such resistance affects our ability  in all product lines  to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity 
our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be dependent upon the ability to adjust rates for its cost 
in addition to regulating rates  certain states have enacted laws that require a property liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers  often restricting an insurer s ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge 
in these markets  we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates  possibly leading to an unacceptable return on equity  or as the facilities recognize a financial deficit  they may in turn have the ability to assess participating insurers  adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition 
laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer s ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
additionally  certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state 
our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors 
the potential benefits of our sophisticated risk segmentation process may not be fully realized we believe that pricing sophistication and underwriting including strategic risk management which  in some situations  considers information that is obtained from credit reports among other factors has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably 
however  because many of our competitors have adopted underwriting criteria and sophisticated pricing models similar to those we use and because other competitors may follow suit  our competitive advantage could decline or be lost 
further  the use of insurance scoring from information that is obtained from credit reports as a factor in underwriting and pricing has at times been challenged by regulators  legislators  litigants and special interest groups in various states 
competitive pressures could also force us to modify our pricing sophistication model 
furthermore  we cannot be assured that these pricing sophistication models will accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur 
allstate protection s operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition  less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates  followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition  more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates 
a downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
risks relating to the allstate financial segment changes in underwriting and actual experience could materially affect profitability and financial condition our product pricing includes long term assumptions regarding investment returns  mortality  morbidity  persistency and operating costs and expenses of the business 
we establish target returns for each product based upon these factors and the average amount of capital that we must hold to support in force contracts taking into account rating agencies and regulatory requirements 
we monitor and manage our pricing and overall sales mix to achieve target new business returns on a portfolio basis  which could result in the discontinuation or de emphasis of products or distribution relationships and a decline in sales 
profitability from new business emerges over a period of years depending on the nature and life of the product and is subject to variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions 
additionally  many of our products have fixed or guaranteed terms that limit our ability to increase revenues or reduce benefits  including credited interest  once the product has been issued 
our profitability in this segment depends on the adequacy of investment spreads  the management of market and credit risks associated with investments  the sufficiency of premiums and contract charges to cover mortality and morbidity benefits  the persistency of policies to ensure recovery of acquisition expenses  and the management of operating costs and expenses within anticipated pricing allowances 
legislation and regulation of the insurance marketplace and products could also affect our profitability and financial condition 
changes in reserve estimates may adversely affect our operating results reserve for life contingent contract benefits is computed on the basis of long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields  mortality  morbidity  persistency and expenses 
we periodically review the adequacy of these reserves on an aggregate basis and if future experience differs significantly from assumptions  adjustments to reserves and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the sales and profitability of spread based products our ability to manage the allstate financial spread based products  such as fixed annuities and institutional products  is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates 
when market interest rates decrease or remain at relatively low levels  proceeds from investments that have matured or have been prepaid or sold may be reinvested at lower yields  reducing investment spread 
lowering interest crediting rates on some products in such an environment can partially offset decreases in investment yield 
however  these changes could be limited by market conditions  regulatory minimum rates or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in investment yields 
decreases in the interest crediting rates offered on products in the allstate financial segment could make those products less attractive  leading to lower sales and or changes in the level of policy loans  surrenders and withdrawals 
non parallel shifts in interest rates  such as increases in short term rates without accompanying increases in medium and long term rates  can influence customer demand for fixed annuities  which could impact the level and profitability of new customer deposits 
increases in market interest rates can also have negative effects on allstate financial  for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments to our customers  which can lead to higher surrenders at a time when the segment s fixed income investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates 
this could lead to the sale of fixed income securities at a loss 
for certain products  principally fixed annuity and interest sensitive life products  the earned rate on assets could lag behind rising market yields 
we may react to market conditions by increasing crediting rates  which could narrow spreads and reduce profitability 
unanticipated surrenders could result in accelerated amortization of dac or affect the recoverability of dac and thereby increase expenses and reduce profitability 
changes in estimates of profitability on interest sensitive life  fixed annuities and other investment products may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition through the amortization of dac dac related to interest sensitive life  fixed annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to actual historical gross profits and estimated future gross profits egp over the estimated lives of the contracts 
the principal assumptions for determining the amount of egp are investment returns  including capital gains and losses on assets supporting contract liabilities  interest crediting rates to contractholders  and the effects of persistency  mortality  expenses  and hedges if applicable 
updates to these assumptions commonly referred to as dac unlocking could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 
in  dac unlocking resulted in increased amortization of dac of million 
in addition in periods when actual gross profits are negative  recapitalization negative amortization of dac is only recorded when determined to be recoverable based on specific facts and circumstances 
examples of such situations include the world wide financial crisis  which resulted in an unprecedented level of realized capital losses 
a principal assumption change impacting egp and the related dac amortization was an increase in the level of expected realized capital losses in and this resulted in the majority of the market value adjusted annuity dac balance being reduced to zero since the products in force were estimated to have no gross profits 
market value adjusted annuity dac will not be recapitalized while there are no estimated gross profits 
facts and circumstances may lead to other situations where dac is not recapitalized 
accordingly  judgments regarding the recognition of allstate financial s dac amortization may adversely affect profitability and financial condition 
narrowing the focus of our product offerings and reducing our concentration in fixed annuities and funding agreements may adversely affect reported results we have been pursuing strategies to narrow our product offerings and reduce our concentration in fixed annuities and funding agreements 
lower new sales of these products  as well as our ongoing risk mitigation and return optimization programs  could negatively impact investment portfolio levels and dac amortization  complicate settlement of expiring contracts including forced sales of assets with unrealized capital losses  and affect goodwill impairment testing and insurance reserves deficiency testing 
a loss of key product distribution relationships could materially affect sales and results of operations certain products in the allstate financial segment are distributed under agreements with other members of the financial services industry that are not affiliated with us 
termination of one or more of these agreements due to  for example  a change in control of one of these distributors or market conditions that make it difficult to achieve our target return on certain products  resulting in relatively uncompetitive pricing  could have a detrimental effect on the sales of allstate financial and its results of operations 
changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products and adversely affect our financial condition under current federal and state income tax law  certain products we offer  primarily life insurance and annuities  receive favorable tax treatment 
this favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products 
congress from time to time considers legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities 
congress also considers proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance and annuities 
legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage or create a disadvantage for certain of our products making them less competitive 
such proposals  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies 
in addition  changes in the federal estate tax laws could negatively affect the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning 
risks relating to investments we are subject to market risk and declines in credit quality which may adversely impact investment income  cause additional realized losses  and cause increased unrealized losses although we continually reevaluate our risk mitigation and return optimization programs  we remain subject to the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices  commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates  credit spreads and equity prices and  to a lesser degree  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we are subject to potential declines in credit quality related to specific issuers or specific industries or related to a general weakening in the economy  which are typically reflected through credit spreads 
credit spread is the additional yield on fixed income securities above the risk free rate typically defined as the yield on us treasury securities that market participants require to compensate them for assuming credit  liquidity and or prepayment risks 
credit spreads vary ie increase or decrease in response to the market s perception of risk and liquidity in a specific issuer or specific sector 
although we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks  the effectiveness of such instruments is subject to the same risks 
a decline in market interest rates or credit spreads could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may earn less than the portfolio s average yield 
in a declining interest rate environment  borrowers may prepay or redeem securities more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates 
a decline could also lead us to purchase longer term or riskier assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities 
an increase in market interest rates or credit spreads could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority of our investment portfolio 
a declining equity market could also cause the investments in our pension plans to decrease or decreasing interest rates could cause the funding target and the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans or the accumulated benefit obligation of our other postretirement benefit plans to increase  either or both resulting in a decrease in the funded status of the plans and a reduction of shareholders equity  increases in pension and other postretirement benefit expense and increases in required contributions to the pension plans 
a decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized losses on securities  including realized losses relating to equity and derivative strategies 
deteriorating financial performance impacting securities collateralized by residential and commercial mortgage loans  collateralized corporate loans  and commercial mortgage loans may lead to write downs and impact our results of operations and financial condition changes in residential or commercial mortgage delinquencies or recovery rates  corporate loan delinquencies or recovery rates  declining real estate prices  changes in credit or bond insurer strength ratings and the quality of service provided by service providers on securities in our portfolios could lead us to determine that write downs are necessary in the future 
the impact of our investment strategies may be adversely affected by developments in the financial markets the impact of our investment portfolio risk mitigation and return optimization programs may be adversely affected by unexpected developments in the financial markets 
for example  derivative contracts may result in coverage that is not as effective as intended thereby leading to the recognition of losses without the recognition of gains expected to mitigate the losses 
concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects on our operating results and financial condition the concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry  collateral type  group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our results of operations and financial condition 
events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry  group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated rather than diversified 
the determination of the amount of realized capital losses recorded for impairments of our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our operating results and financial condition the determination of the amount of realized capital losses recorded for impairments vary by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
we update evaluations regularly and reflect changes in realized capital gains and losses from impairments in operating results if such changes are determined to be other than temporary 
the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on our case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
the amortized cost or cost of our fixed income and equity securities is adjusted for impairments in value deemed to be other than temporary in the period in which the determination is made and recorded in earnings as such evaluations are revised 
there can be no assurance that we have accurately assessed the level of or amounts recorded for impairments taken in our financial statements 
furthermore  additional impairments may need to be recorded in the future 
historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments 
for example  the amortized cost or cost of our fixed income and equity securities is adjusted for impairments in value deemed to be other than temporary in the period in which the determination is made and recorded in earnings 
the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on our case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
the determination of the fair value of our fixed income and equity securities results in unrealized net capital gains and losses and is highly subjective and could materially impact our operating results and financial condition in determining fair values we generally utilize market transaction data for the same or similar instruments 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining fair values is inversely related to the availability of market observable information 
the fair value of assets and liabilities may differ from the actual amount received upon sale of an asset or the actual amount paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
moreover  the use of different valuation assumptions may have a material effect on the assets and liabilities fair values 
the difference between amortized cost or cost and fair value  net of deferred income taxes  certain life and annuity dac  certain deferred sales inducement costs dsi  and certain reserves for life contingent contract benefits  is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
changing market conditions could materially effect the determination of the fair value of securities and unrealized net capital gains and losses could vary significantly 
determining fair value is highly subjective and could materially impact our operating results and financial condition 
risks relating to the insurance industry our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive the insurance industry is highly competitive 
our competitors include other insurers and  because some of our products include a savings or investment component  securities firms  investment advisers  mutual funds  banks and other financial institutions 
many of our competitors have well established national reputations and market similar products 
because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry  including competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents  there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals  or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
furthermore  certain competitors operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore may have dissimilar profitability and return targets 
our ability to successfully operate may also be impaired if we are not effective in filling critical leadership positions  in developing the talent and skills of our human resources  in assimilating new executive talent into our organization  or in deploying human resource talent consistently with our business goals 
difficult conditions in the economy generally could adversely affect our business and operating results some economists continue to project significant negative macroeconomic trends  including relatively high and sustained unemployment  reduced consumer spending  lower home prices  and substantial increases in delinquencies on consumer debt  including defaults on home mortgages 
moreover  recent disruptions in the financial markets  particularly the reduced availability of credit and tightened lending requirements  have impacted the ability of borrowers to refinance loans at more affordable rates 
as with most businesses  we believe difficult conditions in the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
general economic conditions could adversely affect us in the form of consumer behavior and pressure investment results 
consumer behavior could include decreased demand for our products 
for example  as consumers purchase fewer automobiles  our sales of auto insurance may decline 
also  as consumers become more cost conscious  they may choose lower levels of auto and homeowners insurance 
in  declining new car sales and continued weakness in the housing market contributed to lower policies in force 
in addition  holders of some of our life insurance and annuity products may engage in an elevated level of discretionary withdrawals of contractholder funds 
our investment results could be adversely affected as deteriorating financial and business conditions affecting the issuers of the securities in our investment portfolio 
there can be no assurance that actions of the us federal government  federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets and stimulating the economy will achieve the intended effect in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system  the financial markets and the broader economy over the past two years  the us federal government  the federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken actions to address such conditions including  among other things  purchasing mortgage backed and other securities from financial institutions  investing directly in banks  thrifts and bank and savings and loan holding companies and increasing federal spending to stimulate the economy 
while it appears the economy is pulling out of recession  stabilization has been uneven and a sluggish recovery is expected 
there can be no assurance as to the long term impact such actions will have on the financial markets or on economic conditions  including potential inflationary affects 
continued volatility and any further economic deterioration could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
losses from litigation may be material to our operating results or cash flows and financial condition as is typical for a large company  we are involved in various legal actions  including class action litigation challenging a range of company practices and coverage provided by our insurance products 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters  the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarter or annual period and to our financial condition 
we are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth as insurance companies  broker dealers  investment advisers and or investment companies  many of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are complex and subject to change 
moreover  they are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities  including state insurance regulators  state securities administrators  the sec  the finra  the us department of justice  and state attorneys general  each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude 
consequently  we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another s interpretation of the same issue  particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight 
in addition  there is risk that any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment  or that changes in the overall legal environment may  even absent any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue changing  cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective  thus necessitating changes to our practices that may  in some cases  limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
furthermore  in some cases  these laws and regulations are designed to protect or benefit the interests of a specific constituency rather than a range of constituencies 
for example  state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect or benefit purchasers or users of insurance products  not holders of securities issued by the allstate corporation 
in many respects  these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny and members of congress have discussed proposals to provide for federal chartering of insurance companies 
we can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or scope of insurance regulation 
proposed regulatory reforms  and the more stringent application of existing regulations  may make it more expensive for us to conduct our business the federal government has released a set of proposed regulatory reforms with respect to financial services entities 
as part of a larger effort to strengthen the regulation of the financial services market  the proposal outlines certain reforms applicable to the insurance industry  including the establishment of an office of national insurance within the treasury department 
the reforms could also increase the regulation of large insurance conglomerates whose failure could pose a systemic risk to the financial system 
in addition  the federal government has issued a set of principles for reforming the us and international regulatory capital framework for banking firms 
we are a diversified unitary savings and loan holding company for allstate bank  a federal stock savings bank and a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the principal supervisory authority for the diversified unitary savings and loan holding company activities and the bank is the office of thrift supervision ots 
we are subject to ots regulation  examination  supervision and reporting requirements and its enforcement authority 
among other things  this permits the ots to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness and stability of allstate bank 
any additional legislation or regulatory requirements imposed upon us in connection with the federal government proposed regulatory reforms or arising from the principles for reforming the us and international regulatory capital framework for banking firms  and any more stringent enforcement of existing regulations by federal authorities  may make it more expensive for us to conduct our business 
reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices  which may limit our ability to write new business our personal lines catastrophe reinsurance program was designed  utilizing our risk management methodology  to address our exposure to catastrophes nationwide 
market conditions beyond our control impact the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase 
no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as is currently available 
for example  our ability to afford reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for its cost  and there are no assurances that the terms and rates for our current reinsurance program will continue to be available next year 
if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable  we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk  reduce our insurance writings  or develop or seek other alternatives 
reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded insurance  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition the collectability of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors  including changes in market conditions  whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers  or their affiliates  have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract 
our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
a large scale pandemic  the continued threat of terrorism or ongoing military actions may have an adverse effect on the level of claim losses we incur  the value of our investment portfolio  our competitive position  marketability of product offerings  liquidity and operating results a large scale pandemic  the continued threat of terrorism  within the united states and abroad  or ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats  may cause significant volatility and losses in our investment portfolio from declines in the equity markets and from interest rate changes in the united states  europe and elsewhere  and result in loss of life  property damage  disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity 
some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by a large scale pandemic or the continued threat of terrorism 
we seek to mitigate the potential impact of terrorism on our commercial mortgage portfolio by limiting geographical concentrations in key metropolitan areas and by requiring terrorism insurance to the extent that it is commercially available 
additionally  in the allstate protection and allstate financial business segments  a large scale pandemic or terrorist act could have a material adverse effect on the sales  profitability  competitiveness  marketability of product offerings  liquidity  and operating results 
a downgrade in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position  the marketability of our product offerings  and our liquidity  operating results and financial condition financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance company s business 
on an ongoing basis  rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer s ratings due to  for example  a change in an insurer s statutory capital  a change in a rating agency s determination of the amount of risk adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating  an increase in the perceived risk of an insurer s investment portfolio  a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under the insurer s control 
the current insurance financial strength ratings of allstate insurance company are a  aa and aa from am best  standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
the current insurance financial strength ratings of allstate life insurance company are a  aa and a from am best  standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
the allstate corporation currently maintains a senior debt rating of a  a and a from am best  standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
several other affiliates have been assigned their own financial strength ratings by one or more rating agencies 
because all of these ratings are subject to continuous review  the retention of these ratings cannot be assured 
a downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our sales  our competitiveness  the marketability of our product offerings  and our liquidity  operating results and financial condition 
adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption 
in some cases  the markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity 
in the event that we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses  make payments on our indebtedness  pay for capital expenditures or fund acquisitions  our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant 
our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to our industry  our credit ratings and credit capacity  as well as lenders perception of our long or short term financial prospects 
similarly  our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us 
if a combination of these factors were to occur  our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles  which are periodically revised  interpreted and or expanded 
accordingly  we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations  or could be subject to existing guidance as we enter into new transactions  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected 
for a description of changes in accounting standards that are currently pending and  if known  our estimates of their expected impact  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the change in our unrecognized tax benefit during the next months is subject to uncertainty we have disclosed our estimate of net unrecognized tax benefits and the reasonably possible increase or decrease in its balance during the next months in note of the consolidated financial statements 
however  actual results may differ from our estimate for reasons such as changes in our position on specific issues  developments with respect to the governments interpretations of income tax laws or changes in judgment resulting from new information obtained in audits or the appeals process 
the realization of deferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty the realization of our deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  is based on our assumption that we will be able to fully utilize the deductions that are ultimately recognized for tax purposes 
however  actual results may differ from our assumptions if adequate levels of taxable income are not attained 
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our obligations the allstate corporation is a holding company with no significant operations 
the principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries 
state insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries  as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  competitive pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings 
these restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make dividend payments 
limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity  including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders  service our debt  and complete share repurchase programs in the timeframe expected 
the occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning or a support failure from external providers during a disaster could impair our ability to conduct business effectively in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe  an industrial accident  a terrorist attack or war  events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems or a support failure from external providers could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition  particularly if those events affect our computer based data processing  transmission  storage  and retrieval systems 
in the event that a significant number of our managers could be unavailable in the event of a disaster  our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised 
changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition  profitability or cash flows allstate recognizes the scientific view that the world is getting warmer 
climate change  to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns  could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires  the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance  and the results for our allstate protection segment 
to the extent that climate change impacts mortality rates and those changes do not match the long term mortality assumptions in our product pricing  the results for our allstate financial segment would be impacted 
loss of key vendor relationships could affect our operations we rely on services and products provided by many vendors in the united states and abroad 
these include  for example  vendors of computer hardware and software and vendors of services such as claim adjustment services and human resource benefits management services 
in the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services  we may suffer operational impairments and financial losses

we use operating ratios to measure the profitability of our property liability results 
we believe that they enhance an investor s understanding of our profitability 
they are calculated as follows claims and claims expense loss ratio is the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses 
expense ratio is the ratio of amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
combined ratio is the ratio of claims and claims expense  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio

the most critical estimates include those used in determining fair value of financial assets impairment of fixed income and equity securities deferred policy acquisition costs dac amortization reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation reserve for life contingent contract benefits estimation in making these determinations  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to our businesses and operations 
it is reasonably likely that changes in these estimates could occur from period to period and result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a brief summary of each of these critical accounting estimates follows 
for a more detailed discussion of the effect of these estimates on our consolidated financial statements  and the judgments and assumptions related to these estimates  see the referenced sections of this document 
for a complete summary of our significant accounting policies  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
fair value of financial assets fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we categorize our financial assets measured at fair value into a three level hierarchy based on the observability of inputs to the valuation techniques as follows level financial asset values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an active market that we can access 
level financial asset values are based on the following a quoted prices for similar assets in active markets  b quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active  or c valuation models whose inputs are observable  directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset 
level financial asset values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
unobservable inputs reflect our estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the financial assets 
observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in valuing financial assets that are developed based on market data obtained from independent sources 
in the absence of sufficient observable inputs  unobservable inputs reflect our estimates of the assumptions market participants would use in valuing financial assets and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining fair values is inversely related to the availability of market observable information 
if valuation inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
we are responsible for the determination of fair value of financial assets and the supporting assumptions and methodologies 
we gain assurance on the overall reasonableness and consistent application of valuation input assumptions  valuation methodologies and compliance with accounting standards for fair value determination through the execution of various processes and controls designed to ensure that our financial assets are appropriately valued 
we monitor fair values received from third parties and those derived internally on an ongoing basis 
we employ independent third party valuation service providers  broker quotes and internal pricing methods to determine fair values  which provide a single quote or price for each financial instrument 
we obtain or calculate only one quote or price per instrument 
valuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and  through the use of proprietary algorithms  produce valuation information in the form of a single fair value for individual securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of our agreements 
for certain equity securities  valuation service providers provide market quotations for completed transactions on the measurement date 
for other security types  fair values are derived from the valuation service providers proprietary valuation models 
the inputs used by the valuation service providers include  but are not limited to  market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities  interest rate yield curves  credit spreads  liquidity spreads  currency rates  and other information  as applicable 
credit and liquidity spreads are typically implied from completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities 
valuation service providers also use proprietary discounted cash flow models that are widely accepted in the financial services industry and similar to those used by other market participants to value the same financial instruments 
the valuation models take into account  among other things  market observable information as of the measurement date  as described above  as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued including its term  interest rate  credit rating  industry sector  and where applicable  collateral quality and other issue or issuer specific information 
executing valuation models effectively requires seasoned professional judgment and experience 
in cases where market transactions or other market observable data is limited  the extent to which judgment is applied varies inversely with the availability of market observable information 
for certain of our financial assets carried at fair value  where our valuation service providers cannot provide fair value determinations  we obtain a single non binding price quote from a broker familiar with the security who  similar to our valuation service providers  may consider transactions or activity in similar securities  as applicable  among other information 
the brokers providing price quotes are generally from the brokerage divisions of leading financial institutions with market making  underwriting and distribution expertise regarding the security subject to valuation 
the fair value of certain financial assets  including privately placed corporate securities  auction rate securities ars backed by student loans  equity indexed notes  and certain free standing derivatives  where our valuation service providers or brokers do not provide fair value determinations  is determined using valuation methods and models widely accepted in the financial services industry 
internally developed valuation models  which include inputs that may not be market observable and as such involve some degree of judgment  are considered appropriate for each class of security to which they are applied 
our internal pricing methods are primarily based on models using discounted cash flow methodologies that develop a single best estimate of fair value 
our models generally incorporate inputs that we believe are representative of inputs other market participants would use to determine fair value of the same instruments  including yield curves  quoted market prices of comparable securities  published credit spreads  and other applicable market data 
additional inputs that are used to model fair value include internally derived assumptions such as liquidity premium and credit ratings  as well as instrument specific characteristics that include  but are not limited to  coupon rate  expected cash flows  sector of issuer  and call provisions 
internally assigned credit ratings are generally consistent with external ratings published by the national association of insurance commissioners naic  however  they are developed at a more finite level 
for example  an naic rating of includes securities rated triple  double and single a by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro 
we believe our internal ratings provide for a more reliable estimate of fair value since we can more precisely match these ratings to other market observable valuation inputs  such as credit and sector spreads  when performing these valuations 
due to the existence of non market observable inputs  such as liquidity premiums  judgment is required in developing these fair values 
as a result  the fair value of these financial assets may differ from the amount actually received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
moreover  the use of different valuation assumptions may have a material effect on the financial assets fair values 
for the majority of our financial assets measured at fair value  all significant inputs are based on market observable data and significant management judgment does not affect the periodic determination of fair value 
the determination of fair value using discounted cash flow models involves management judgment when significant model inputs are not based on market observable data 
however  where market observable data is available  it takes precedence  and as a result  no range of reasonably likely inputs exists from which the basis of a sensitivity analysis could be constructed 
there is one primary situation where a discounted cash flow model utilizes a significant input that is not market observable 
it relates to the determination of fair value for our ars backed by student loans 
the significant input is the assumption about the anticipated date liquidity will return to this market that is  when auction failures will cease 
determination of this assumption allows for matching to market observable inputs when performing these valuations 
the following table displays the sensitivity of reasonably likely changes in the assumption about the anticipated date liquidity will return to the ars backed by student loans market as of december  the selection of these hypothetical scenarios represents an illustration of the estimated potential proportional effect of alternate assumptions and should not be construed as either a prediction of future events or an indication that it would be reasonably likely that all securities would be similarly affected 
in millions ars backed by student loans at fair value percentage change in fair value resulting from decrease in assumption by four months for the anticipated date liquidity will return to this market increase in assumption by four months for the anticipated date liquidity will return to this market we believe our most significant exposure to changes in fair value is due to market risk 
our exposure to changes in market conditions is discussed fully in the market risk section of the md a 
we employ specific control processes to determine the reasonableness of the fair values of our financial assets 
our processes are designed to ensure that the values received or internally estimated are accurately recorded and that the data inputs and the valuation techniques utilized are appropriate  consistently applied  and that the assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value 
for example  on a continuing basis  we assess the reasonableness of individual security values received from valuation service providers and those derived from internal models that exceed certain thresholds as compared to previous values received from those valuation service providers or derived from internal models 
in addition  we may validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing information obtained from our valuation service providers to other third party valuation sources for selected securities 
for internal pricing models  we have implemented price validation procedures such as back testing of actual sales  which corroborates the various model inputs to market observable data 
when fair value determinations are expected to be more variable  we validate them through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investment transactions 
we also perform an analysis to determine whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset when compared to normal market activity  and if so  whether transactions may not be orderly 
among the indicators we consider in determining whether a significant decrease in the volume and level of market activity for a specific asset has occurred include the level of new issuances in the primary market  trading volume in the secondary market  level of credit spreads over historical levels  bid ask spread  and price consensuses among market participants and sources 
if evidence indicates that prices are based on transactions that are not orderly  we place little  if any  weight on the transaction price and will estimate fair value using an internal pricing model 
as of december  and  we did not alter fair values provided by our valuation service providers or brokers or substitute them with an internal pricing model 
the following table identifies fixed income and equity securities and short term investments as of december  by source of value determination in millions fair value percent to total fair value based on internal sources fair value based on external sources total includes billion that are valued using broker quotes

impairment of fixed income and equity securities for investments classified as available for sale  the difference between fair value and amortized cost for fixed income securities and cost for equity securities  net of certain other items and deferred income taxes as disclosed in note  is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of financial position and is not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party or when the decline in fair value is deemed other than temporary 
we have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate each fixed income and equity security whose carrying value may be other than temporarily impaired 
for each fixed income security in an unrealized loss position  we assess whether management with the appropriate authority has made a decision to sell or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis for reasons such as liquidity  contractual or regulatory purposes 
if a security meets either of these criteria  the security s decline in fair value is deemed other than temporary and is recorded in earnings 
if we have not made the decision to sell the fixed income security and it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell the fixed income security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  we evaluate whether we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to be collected from the fixed income security discounted at the security s original or current effective rate  as appropriate  to calculate a recovery value and determine whether a credit loss exists 
the determination of cash flow estimates is inherently subjective and methodologies may vary depending on facts and circumstances specific to the security 
all reasonably available information relevant to the collectability of the security  including past events  current conditions  and reasonable and supportable assumptions and forecasts  are considered when developing the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected 
that information generally includes  but is not limited to  the remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  foreign exchange rates  the financial condition of the issue or issuer s  expected defaults  expected recoveries  the value of underlying collateral and current subordination levels  vintage  geographic concentration  available reserves or escrows  third party guarantees and other credit enhancements 
additionally  other information  such as industry analyst reports and forecasts  sector credit ratings  financial condition of the bond insurer for insured fixed income securities  and other market data relevant to the realizability of contractual cash flows  may also be considered 
the estimated fair value of collateral may be used to estimate recovery value if we determine that the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for ultimate settlement 
if the estimated recovery value is less than the amortized cost of the security  a credit loss exists and an other than temporary impairment for the difference between the estimated recovery value and amortized cost is recorded in earnings 
the unrealized loss deemed to be related to factors other than credit remains classified in other comprehensive income 
if we determine that the fixed income security does not have sufficient cash flow or other information to determine a recovery value for the security  we may conclude that the entire decline in fair value is deemed to be credit related and is recorded in earnings 
there are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent in evaluating impairments of equity securities and determining if they are other than temporary  including our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition  near term and long term prospects of the issue or issuer  including relevant industry specific market conditions and trends  geographic location and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices  and the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position  including overall market conditions which could affect liquidity 
once assumptions and estimates are made  any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to subsequently determine that a fixed income or equity security is other than temporary impaired  including general economic conditions that are worse than previously forecasted or that have a greater adverse effect on a particular issuer or industry sector than originally estimated  changes in the facts and circumstances related to a particular issue or issuer s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations  and changes in facts and circumstances that result in changes to management s intent to sell or result in our assessment that it is more likely than not we will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost of a fixed income security or causes a change in our ability or intent to hold an equity security until it recovers in value 
changes in assumptions  facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are realized 
the charge to earnings  while potentially significant to net income  would not have a significant effect on shareholders equity  since the majority of our portfolio is designated as available for sale and carried at fair value and as a result  any related unrealized loss  net of deferred income taxes  dac  dsi and reserves for life contingent contract benefits  would already be reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
the determination of the amount of impairment is an inherently subjective process based on periodic evaluation of the factors described above 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
we update our evaluations regularly and reflect changes in other than temporary impairments in results of operations as such evaluations are revised 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions in the determination of the amount of impairments may have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements 
fixed income securities subject to other than temporary impairment write downs continue to earn investment income when future expected payments are reasonably estimable  and any discount or premium is recognized using the effective yield method over the expected life of the security  otherwise income recognition is discontinued 
for additional detail on investment impairments  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
deferred policy acquisition costs amortization we incur significant costs in connection with acquiring insurance policies and investment contracts 
in accordance with gaap  costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring insurance policies and investment contracts are deferred and recorded as an asset on the consolidated statements of financial position 
dac related to property liability contracts is amortized into income as premiums are earned  typically over periods of six to twelve months 
the amortization methodology for dac for allstate financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates 
dac related to traditional life insurance is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business 
significant assumptions relating to estimated premiums  investment returns  as well as mortality  persistency and expenses to administer the business are established at the time the policy is issued and are generally not revised during the life of the policy 
the assumptions for determining the timing and amount of dac amortization are consistent with the assumptions used to calculate the reserve for life contingent contract benefits 
any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels and any estimated premium deficiencies may result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period such events occur 
generally  the amortization periods for these policies approximates the estimated lives of the policies 
the recovery of dac is dependent upon the future profitability of the business 
we periodically review the adequacy of reserves and recoverability of dac for these policies on an aggregate basis using actual experience 
we aggregate all traditional life insurance products and immediate annuities with life contingencies in the analysis 
in the event actual experience is significantly adverse compared to the original assumptions  a premium deficiency is deemed to exist and any remaining unamortized dac balance must be expensed to the extent not recoverable and a premium deficiency reserve may be required if the remaining dac balance is insufficient to absorb the deficiency 
in and  our reviews concluded that no premium deficiency adjustments were necessary  primarily due to projected profit from traditional life insurance more than offsetting the projected losses in immediate annuities with life contingencies 
in  for traditional life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies  an aggregate premium deficiency of million pre tax million after tax resulted primarily from a study indicating that the annuitants on certain life contingent contracts are projected to live longer than we anticipated when the contracts were issued and  to a lesser degree  a reduction in the related investment portfolio yield 
the deficiency was recorded through a reduction in dac 
dac related to interest sensitive life  fixed annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to the incidence of the total present value of gross profits  which includes both actual historical gross profits agp and estimated future gross profits egp expected to be earned over the estimated lives of the contracts 
the amortization is net of interest on the prior period dac balance using rates established at the inception of the contracts 
actual amortization periods generally range from years  however  incorporating estimates of customer surrender rates  partial withdrawals and deaths generally results in the majority of the dac being amortized during the surrender charge period  which is typically years for interest sensitive life and years for fixed annuities 
the cumulative dac amortization is reestimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to results of operations when there is a difference between the incidence of actual versus expected gross profits in a reporting period or when there is a change in total egp 
agp and egp consist primarily of the following components contract charges for the cost of insurance less mortality costs and other benefits benefit margin  investment income and realized capital gains and losses less interest credited investment margin  and surrender and other contract charges less maintenance expenses expense margin 
the principal assumptions for determining the amount of egp are investment returns  including capital gains and losses on assets supporting contract liabilities  interest crediting rates to contractholders  and the effects of persistency  mortality  expenses  and hedges if applicable  and these assumptions are reasonably likely to have the greatest impact on the amount of dac amortization 
changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to reasonably predict their future movements or offsetting impacts over time 
each reporting period  dac amortization is recognized in proportion to agp for that period adjusted for interest on the prior period dac balance 
this amortization process includes an assessment of agp compared to egp  the actual amount of business remaining in force and realized capital gains and losses on investments supporting the product liability 
the impact of realized capital gains and losses on amortization of dac depends upon which product liability is supported by the assets that give rise to the gain or loss 
if the agp is greater than egp in the period  but the total egp is unchanged  the amount of dac amortization will generally increase  resulting in a current period decrease to earnings 
the opposite result generally occurs when the agp is less than the egp in the period  but the total egp is unchanged 
however  when dac amortization or a component of gross profits for a quarterly period is potentially negative which would result in an increase of the dac balance as a result of negative agp  the specific facts and circumstances surrounding the potential negative amortization are considered to determine whether it is appropriate for recognition in the consolidated financial statements 
negative amortization is only recorded when the increased dac balance is determined to be recoverable based on facts and circumstances 
negative amortization was not recorded for certain fixed annuities during and periods in which significant capital losses were realized on their related investment portfolio 
for products exposed to investment credit losses in excess of our expectations that may cause periodic agp to become temporarily negative  egp and agp utilized in dac amortization may be modified to exclude the higher credit losses 
annually  we review and update all assumptions underlying the projections of egp  including investment returns  comprising investment income and realized capital gains and losses  interest crediting rates  persistency  mortality  expenses and the effect of any hedges 
at each reporting period  we assess whether any revisions to assumptions used to determine dac amortization are required 
these reviews and updates may result in amortization acceleration or deceleration  which are commonly referred to as dac unlocking 
if the update of assumptions causes total egp to increase  the rate of dac amortization will generally decrease  resulting in a current period increase to earnings 
a decrease to earnings generally occurs when the assumption update causes the total egp to decrease 
over the past three years  our most significant dac assumption updates that resulted in a change to egp and the amortization of dac have been revisions to expected future investment returns  primarily realized capital losses  mortality  expenses and the number of contracts in force or persistency 
the following table provides the effect on dac amortization of changes in assumptions relating to the gross profit components of investment margin  benefit margin and expense margin during the years ended december in millions investment margin benefit margin expense margin net acceleration deceleration dac amortization acceleration related to changes in the egp component of investment margin in the first quarter of was primarily due to an increase in the level of expected realized capital losses in and the deceleration related to benefit margin was due to more favorable projected life insurance mortality 
the acceleration related to expense margin resulted from current and expected expense levels higher than previously projected 
dac amortization acceleration related to changes in the egp component of investment margin in was primarily due to the level of realized capital losses impacting actual gross profits in and the impact of realized capital losses on expected gross profits in the deceleration related to benefit margin was due to more favorable projected life insurance mortality 
the acceleration related to expense margin resulted from current and expected expense levels higher than previously projected 
dac amortization deceleration related to changes in the egp component of investment margin in was due to higher yields from repositioning of the investment portfolio and reduced interest crediting rates on annuities 
the deceleration related to benefit margin was due to more favorable projected life insurance mortality 
the acceleration related to expense margin was a result of expenses being higher than expected 
the following table displays the sensitivity of reasonably likely changes in assumptions included in the gross profit components of investment margin or benefit margin to amortization of the dac balance as of december  in millions december  increase reduction in dac increase in future investment margins of basis points decrease in future investment margins of basis points decrease in future life mortality by increase in future life mortality by any potential changes in assumptions discussed above are measured without consideration of correlation among assumptions 
therefore  it would be inappropriate to add them together in an attempt to estimate overall variability in amortization

reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims and claims expenses under insurance policies we have issued 
property liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves 
these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr  as of the financial statement date 
characteristics of reserves reserves are established independently of business segment management for each business segment and line of business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle claims  less losses that have been paid 
the significant lines of business are auto  homeowners  and other lines for allstate protection  and asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines for discontinued lines and coverages 
allstate protection s claims are typically reported promptly with relatively little reporting lag between the date of occurrence and the date the loss is reported 
auto and homeowners liability losses generally take an average of about two years to settle  while auto physical damage  homeowners property and other personal lines have an average settlement time of less than one year 
discontinued lines and coverages involve long tail losses  such as those related to asbestos and environmental claims  which often involve substantial reporting lags and extended times to settle 
reserves are the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of losses incurred and the amount of paid losses as of the reporting date 
reserves are estimated for both reported and unreported claims  and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling all incurred claims 
we update the majority of our reserve estimates quarterly and as new information becomes available or as events emerge that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims 
changes in prior year reserve estimates reserve reestimates  which may be material  are determined by comparing updated estimates of ultimate losses to prior estimates  and the differences are recorded as property liability insurance claims and claims expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the period such changes are determined 
estimating the ultimate cost of claims and claims expenses is an inherently uncertain and complex process involving a high degree of judgment and is subject to the evaluation of numerous variables 
the actuarial methods used to develop reserve estimates reserve estimates are derived by using several different actuarial estimation methods that are variations on one primary actuarial technique 
the actuarial technique is known as a chain ladder estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses paid losses plus individual case reserves established by claim adjusters for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time 
an accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred 
a report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported 
both classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future 
the key assumptions affecting our reserve estimates comprise data elements including claim counts  paid losses  case reserves  and development factors calculated with this data 
in the chain ladder estimation technique  a ratio development factor is calculated which compares current period results to results in the prior period for each accident year 
a three year or two year average development factor  based on historical results  is usually multiplied by the current period experience to estimate the development of losses of each accident year into the next time period 
the development factors for the future time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining future periods to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for each accident year 
the implicit assumption of this technique is that an average of historical development factors is predictive of future loss development  as the significant size of our experience data base achieves a high degree of statistical credibility in actuarial projections of this type 
the effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process  the implicit assumption being that a multi year average development factor includes an adequate provision 
occasionally  unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by external and internal factors such as changes in claim reporting  settlement patterns  unusually large losses  process changes  legal or regulatory changes  and other influences 
in these instances  analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses 
how reserve estimates are established and updated reserve estimates are developed at a very detailed level  and the results of these numerous micro level best estimates are aggregated to form a consolidated reserve estimate 
for example  over one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to estimate losses for each line of insurance  major components of losses such as coverages and perils  major states or groups of states and for reported losses and ibnr 
the actuarial methods described above are used to analyze the settlement patterns of claims by determining the development factors for specific data elements that are necessary components of a reserve estimation process 
development factors are calculated quarterly for data elements such as claim counts reported and settled  paid losses  and paid losses combined with case reserves 
the calculation of development factors from changes in these data elements also impacts claim severity trends  which is a common industry reference used to explain changes in reserve estimates 
the historical development patterns for these data elements are used as the assumptions to calculate reserve estimates 
often  several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component  incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses  from which we select our best estimate for each component  occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment  as described above 
these micro level estimates are not based on a single set of assumptions 
actuarial judgments that may be applied to these components of certain micro level estimates generally do not have a material impact on the consolidated level of reserves 
moreover  this detailed micro level process does not permit or result in a compilation of a company wide roll up to generate a range of needed loss reserves that would be meaningful 
based on our review of these estimates  our best estimate of required reserves for each state line coverage component is recorded for each accident year  and the required reserves for each component are summed to create the reserve balance carried on our consolidated statements of financial position 
reserves are reestimated quarterly  by combining historical results with current actual results to calculate new development factors 
this process incorporates the historic and latest actual trends  and other underlying changes in the data elements used to calculate reserve estimates 
new development factors are likely to differ from previous development factors used in prior reserve estimates because actual results claims reported or settled  losses paid  or changes to case reserves occur differently than the implied assumptions contained in the previous development factor calculations 
if claims reported  paid losses  or case reserve changes are greater or less than the levels estimated by previous development factors  reserve reestimates increase or decrease 
when actual development of these data elements is different than the historical development pattern used in a prior period reserve estimate  a new reserve is determined 
the difference between indicated reserves based on new reserve estimates and recorded reserves the previous estimate is the amount of reserve reestimate and is recognized as an increase or decrease in property liability insurance claims and claims expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
total property liability reserve reestimates  after tax  as a percent of net income in  and were  and  respectively 
for property liability  the year average of reserve reestimates as a percentage of total reserves was a favorable  for allstate protection  the year average of reserve estimates was a favorable and for discontinued lines and coverages  the year average of reserve reestimates was an unfavorable  each of these results being consistent within a reasonable actuarial tolerance for our respective businesses 
allstate protection reserve reestimates were primarily the result of auto claim severity development that was better than expected  and for discontinued lines and coverages  reestimates were primarily a result of increased reported claim activity claims frequency 
a more detailed discussion of reserve reestimates is presented in the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of this document 
the following table shows net claims and claims expense reserves by operating segment and line of business as of december in millions allstate protection auto homeowners other lines total allstate protection discontinued lines and coverages asbestos environmental other discontinued lines total discontinued lines and coverages total property liability allstate protection reserve estimates factors affecting reserve estimates reserve estimates are developed based on the processes and historical development trends as previously described 
these estimates are considered in conjunction with known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including our experience with similar cases  actual claims paid  differing payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs  product mix and contractual terms  changes in law and regulation  judicial decisions  and economic conditions 
when we experience changes of the type previously mentioned  we may need to apply actuarial judgment in the determination and selection of development factors considered more reflective of the new trends  such as combining shorter or longer periods of historical results with current actual results to produce development factors based on two year  three year  or longer development periods to reestimate our reserves 
for example  if a legal change is expected to have a significant impact on the development of claim severity for a coverage which is part of a particular line of insurance in a specific state  actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors that will most accurately reflect the expected impact on that specific estimate 
another example would be when a change in economic conditions is expected to affect the cost of repairs to damaged autos or property for a particular line  coverage  or state  actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors to use in the reserve estimate that will most accurately reflect the expected impacts on severity development 
as claims are reported  for certain liability claims of sufficient size and complexity  the field adjusting staff establishes case reserve estimates of ultimate cost  based on their assessment of facts and circumstances related to each individual claim 
for other claims which occur in large volumes and settle in a relatively short time frame  it is not practical or efficient to set case reserves for each claim  and a statistical case reserve is set for these claims based on estimation techniques previously described 
in the normal course of business  we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters  appraisers  engineers  inspectors  and other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims 
historically  the case reserves set by the field adjusting staff have not proven to be an entirely accurate estimate of the ultimate cost of claims 
to provide for this  a development reserve is estimated using previously described processes  and allocated to pending claims as a supplement to case reserves 
typically  the case and supplemental development reserves comprise about of total reserves 
another major component of reserves is ibnr 
typically  ibnr comprises about of total reserves 
generally  the initial reserves for a new accident year are established based on severity assumptions for different business segments  lines and coverages based on historical relationships to relevant inflation indicators  and reserves for prior accident years are statistically determined using processes previously described 
changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy 
we mitigate these effects through various loss management programs 
injury claims are affected largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices 
for auto physical damage coverages  we monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against a weighted average of the maintenance and repair price index and the parts and equipment price index 
we believe our claim settlement initiatives  such as improvements to the claim review and settlement process  the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims  litigation management and defense strategies  as well as various other loss management initiatives underway  contribute to the mitigation of injury and physical damage severity trends 
changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials  the cost of construction and property repair services  the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents  the types of claims that qualify for coverage  deductibles and other economic and environmental factors 
we employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors 
as loss experience for the current year develops for each type of loss  it is monitored relative to initial assumptions until it is judged to have sufficient statistical credibility 
from that point in time and forward  reserves are reestimated using statistical actuarial processes to reflect the impact actual loss trends have on development factors incorporated into the actuarial estimation processes 
statistical credibility is usually achieved by the end of the first calendar year  however  when trends for the current accident year exceed initial assumptions sooner  they are usually determined to be credible  and reserves are increased accordingly 
the very detailed processes for developing reserve estimates  and the lack of a need and existence of a common set of assumptions or development factors  limits aggregate reserve level testing for variability of data elements 
however  by applying standard actuarial methods to consolidated historic accident year loss data for major loss types  comprising auto injury losses  auto physical damage losses and homeowner losses  we develop variability analyses consistent with the way we develop reserves by measuring the potential variability of development factors  as described in the section titled potential reserve estimate variability below 
causes of reserve estimate uncertainty since reserves are estimates of the unpaid portions of claims and claims expenses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  requires regular reevaluation and refinement of estimates to determine our ultimate loss estimate 
at each reporting date  the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year 
the greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled but must be estimated as of the current reporting date 
most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and homes  and medical care for injuries from accidents 
during the first year after the end of an accident year  a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled 
when accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the initial accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates  the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly 
consequently  this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year 
after the second year  the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle  such as those involving serious injuries or litigation 
private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates our typical annual percentage payout of reserves for an accident year is approximately in the first year after the end of the accident year  in the second year  in the third year  in the fourth year  and the remaining thereafter 
reserves for catastrophe losses property liability claims and claims expense reserves also include reserves for catastrophe losses 
catastrophe losses are an inherent risk of the property liability insurance industry that have contributed  and will continue to contribute  to potentially material year to year fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position 
we define a catastrophe as an event that produces pre tax losses before reinsurance in excess of million and involves multiple first party policyholders  or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset  per event threshold of average claims in a specific area  occurring within a certain amount of time following the event 
catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds  winter storms  tornadoes  hailstorms  wildfires  tropical storms  hurricanes  earthquakes and volcanoes 
we are also exposed to man made catastrophic events  such as certain acts of terrorism or industrial accidents 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted 
the estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophes also comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and ibnr  primarily for damage to property 
in general  our estimates for catastrophe reserves are based on claim adjuster inspections and the application of historical loss development factors as described previously 
however  depending on the nature of the catastrophe  as noted above  the estimation process can be further complicated 
for example  for hurricanes  complications could include the inability of insureds to promptly report losses  limitations placed on claims adjusting staff affecting their ability to inspect losses  determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy generally for damage caused by wind or wind driven rain or specifically excluded coverage caused by flood  estimating additional living expenses  and assessing the impact of demand surge  exposure to mold damage  and the effects of numerous other considerations  including the timing of a catastrophe in relation to other events  such as at or near the end of a financial reporting period  which can affect the availability of information needed to estimate reserves for that reporting period 
in these situations  we may need to adapt our practices to accommodate these circumstances in order to determine a best estimate of our losses from a catastrophe 
as an example  in to complete an estimate for certain areas affected by hurricane katrina and not yet inspected by our claims adjusting staff  or where we believed our historical loss development factors were not predictive  we relied on analysis of actual claim notices received compared to total pif  as well as visual  governmental and third party information  including aerial photos  area observations  and data on wind speed and flood depth to the extent available 
potential reserve estimate variability the aggregation of numerous micro level estimates for each business segment  line of insurance  major components of losses such as coverages and perils  and major states or groups of states for reported losses and ibnr forms the reserve liability recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position 
because of this detailed approach to developing our reserve estimates  there is not a single set of assumptions that determine our reserve estimates at the consolidated level 
given the numerous micro level estimates for reported losses and ibnr  management does not believe the processes that we follow will produce a statistically credible or reliable actuarial reserve range that would be meaningful 
reserve estimates  by their very nature  are very complex to determine and subject to significant judgment  and do not represent an exact determination for each outstanding claim 
accordingly  as actual claims  and or paid losses  and or case reserve results emerge  our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle will be different than previously estimated 
to develop a statistical indication of potential reserve variability within reasonably likely possible outcomes  an actuarial technique stochastic modeling is applied to the countrywide consolidated data elements for paid losses and paid losses combined with case reserves separately for injury losses  auto physical damage losses  and homeowners losses excluding catastrophe losses 
based on the combined historical variability of the development factors calculated for these data elements  an estimate of the standard error or standard deviation around these reserve estimates is calculated within each accident year for the last eleven years for each type of loss 
the variability of these reserve estimates within one standard deviation of the mean a measure of frequency of dispersion often viewed to be an acceptable level of accuracy is believed by management to represent a reasonable and statistically probable measure of potential variability 
based on our products and coverages  historical experience  the statistical credibility of our extensive data and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates  we estimate that the potential variability of our allstate protection reserves  excluding reserves for catastrophe losses  within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes  may be approximately plus or minus  or plus or minus million in net income 
a lower level of variability exists for auto injury losses  which comprise approximately of reserves  due to their relatively stable development patterns over a longer duration of time required to settle claims 
other types of losses  such as auto physical damage  homeowners losses and other losses  which comprise about of reserves  tend to have greater variability but are settled in a much shorter period of time 
although this evaluation reflects most reasonably likely outcomes  it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts 
historical variability of reserve estimates is reported in the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of this document 
adequacy of reserve estimates we believe our net claims and claims expense reserves are appropriately established based on available methodology  facts  technology  laws and regulations 
we calculate and record a single best reserve estimate  in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards  for each line of insurance  its components coverages and perils and state  for reported losses and for ibnr losses  and as a result we believe that no other estimate is better than our recorded amount 
due to the uncertainties involved  the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts  which are based on our best estimates 
discontinued lines and coverages reserve estimates characteristics of discontinued lines exposure we continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who were exposed to asbestos or products containing asbestos 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up costs 
our exposure to asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the s through the mid s  including reinsurance on primary insurance written on large us companies  and from direct excess insurance written from through  including substantial excess general liability coverages on large us companies 
additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the s through the mid s 
other discontinued lines exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims  such as those for medical devices and other products 
in  the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property liability industry was amended to introduce an absolute pollution exclusion  which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims  and to add an asbestos exclusion 
most general liability policies issued prior to contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage 
general liability policies issued in and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages 
our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks 
our exposure to liability for asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage  direct excess insurance or direct primary commercial insurance 
the direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially excess in nature 
direct excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans 
the nature of excess coverage and reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention on primary insurance plans 
our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we had purchased on our direct excess business 
our assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers reinsurance programs 
the reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions 
the majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure  approximately  is for excess of loss coverage  while the remaining is for pro rata coverage 
our direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers 
this business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many diverse business sectors located throughout the country 
how reserve estimates are established and updated we conduct an annual review in the third quarter to evaluate and establish asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines reserves 
changes to reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined 
using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment  this detailed and comprehensive grounds up methodology determines asbestos reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure ie claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by individual policyholders  and determines environmental reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure ie environmental damages  respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties  appropriateness and cost of remediation to pollution and related clean up costs 
the number and cost of these claims is affected by intense advertising by trial lawyers seeking asbestos plaintiffs  and entities with asbestos exposure seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos liabilities  initially causing a delay in the reporting of claims  often followed by an acceleration and an increase in claims and claims expenses as settlements occur 
after evaluating our insureds probable liabilities for asbestos and or environmental claims  we evaluate our insureds coverage programs for such claims 
we consider our insureds total available insurance coverage  including the coverage we issued 
we also consider relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and applicable coverage defenses or determinations  if any 
evaluation of both the insureds estimated liabilities and our exposure to the insureds depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment 
this analysis is conducted by our specialized claims adjusting staff and legal counsel 
based on these evaluations  case reserves are established by claims adjusting staff and actuarial analysis is employed to develop an ibnr reserve  which includes estimated potential reserve development and claims that have occurred but have not been reported 
as of december  and  ibnr was and  respectively  of combined asbestos and environmental reserves 
for both asbestos and environmental reserves  we also evaluate our historical direct net loss and expense paid and incurred experience to assess any emerging trends  fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and incurred activity 
other discontinued lines and coverages the following table shows reserves for other discontinued lines which provide for remaining loss and loss expense liabilities related to business no longer written by us  other than asbestos and environmental  as of december in millions other mass torts workers compensation commercial and other other discontinued lines other mass torts describes direct excess and reinsurance general liability coverage provided for cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and environmental 
workers compensation and commercial and other include run off from discontinued direct primary  direct excess and reinsurance commercial insurance operations of various coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental 
reserves are based on considerations similar to those previously described  as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures 
potential reserve estimate variability establishing discontinued lines and coverages net loss reserves for asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of claims 
among the complications are lack of historical data  long reporting delays  uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure and unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage  unresolved legal issues regarding the determination  availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits  plaintiffs evolving and expanding theories of liability  availability and collectability of recoveries from reinsurance  retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements  estimates of the extent and timing of any contractual liability  the impact of bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants  and other uncertainties 
there are also complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered  or were ever intended to be covered  and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium  reinsurance or other contractual agreements 
courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage  what types of losses are covered  whether there is an insurer obligation to defend  how policy limits are determined  how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted  and whether clean up costs represent insured property damage 
our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform  class action litigation  and other potential legislation and judicial decisions 
environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal superfund law and similar state statutes 
there can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair  effective and cost efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims 
we believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future  and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves 
historical variability of reserve estimates is demonstrated in the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of this document 
adequacy of reserve estimates management believes its net loss reserves for environmental  asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts  technology  laws  regulations  and assessments of other pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure ie claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by individual policyholders  assuming no change in the legal  legislative or economic environment 
due to the uncertainties and factors described above  management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required

reserve for life contingent contract benefits estimation due to the long term nature of these policies  benefits are payable over many years  accordingly  the reserves are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid  reduced by the present value of future expected net premiums 
long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields  mortality  morbidity  policy terminations and expenses are used when establishing the reserve for life contingent contract benefits payable under insurance policies including traditional life insurance  life contingent immediate annuities and voluntary health products 
these assumptions  which for traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method  include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by characteristics such as type of coverage  year of issue and policy duration 
future investment yield assumptions are determined based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields 
mortality  morbidity and policy termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry experience 
expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium paying period 
these assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued  are consistent with assumptions for determining dac amortization for these policies  and are generally not changed during the policy coverage period 
however  if actual experience emerges in a manner that is significantly adverse relative to the original assumptions  adjustments to dac or reserves may be required resulting in a charge to earnings which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we periodically review the adequacy of reserves and recoverability of dac for these policies on an aggregate basis using actual experience 
in the event actual experience is significantly adverse compared to the original assumptions  a premium deficiency is deemed to exist and any remaining unamortized dac balance must be expensed to the extent not recoverable and the establishment of a premium deficiency reserve may be required 
in and  our reviews concluded that no premium deficiency adjustments were necessary  primarily due to profit from traditional life insurance more than offsetting the projected losses in immediate annuities with life contingencies 
in  for traditional life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies  an aggregate premium deficiency of million pre tax million after tax resulted primarily from a study indicating that the annuitants on certain life contingent contracts are projected to live longer than we anticipated when the contracts were issued and  to a lesser degree  a reduction in the related investment portfolio yield 
the deficiency was recorded through a reduction in dac 
we will continue to monitor the experience of our traditional life insurance and immediate annuities 
we anticipate that mortality  investment and reinvestment yields  and policy terminations are the factors that would be most likely to require premium deficiency adjustments to these reserves or related dac

property liability investments as of december  were billion  an increase of from billion as of december  net investment income was billion in  a decrease of from billion in net realized capital losses were million in compared to billion in property liability operations overview our property liability operations consist of two business segments allstate protection and discontinued lines and coverages 
allstate protection comprises two brands  the allstate brand and encompass brand 
allstate protection is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance  primarily private passenger auto and homeowners insurance  to individuals in the united states and canada 
discontinued lines and coverages includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off 
these segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources 
underwriting income  a measure that is not based on gaap and is reconciled to net income below  is calculated as premiums earned  less claims and claims expense losses  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges  as determined using gaap 
we use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the property liability insurance operations separately from investment results 
it is also an integral component of incentive compensation 
it is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance 
net income is the gaap measure most directly comparable to underwriting income 
underwriting income should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business 
the table below includes gaap operating ratios we use to measure our profitability 
we believe that they enhance an investor s understanding of our profitability 
they are calculated as follows claims and claims expense loss ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses 
expense ratio the ratio of amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses  and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses  and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
the difference between and the combined ratio represents underwriting income as a percentage of premiums earned 
we have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the gaap operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods 
effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
this ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses 
effect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio the percentage of prior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
this ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses 
effect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio the percentage of restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
effect of discontinued lines and coverages on combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense and other costs and expenses in the discontinued lines and coverages segment to property liability premiums earned 
the sum of the effect of discontinued lines and coverages on the combined ratio and the allstate protection combined ratio is equal to the property liability combined ratio

we also sell auto and homeowners insurance through independent agencies under both the allstate brand and the encompass brand 
our operating priorities for the protection segment include achieving profitable market share growth for the auto business as well as earning acceptable returns on the homeowners business 
key goals include improving customer loyalty and retention broadening customer product relationships improving competitive position through pricing sophistication  claims efficiency and expense management investing in the effectiveness and reach of our multiple distribution channels maintaining a strong capital foundation through risk management and effective resource allocation our customer focused strategy for the allstate brand aligns targeted marketing  product innovation  distribution effectiveness  and pricing toward acquiring and retaining an increased share of high lifetime value customers 
the allstate brand will utilize targeted marketing delivered to high lifetime value prospects to promote our strategic priorities  with messaging that continues to communicate affordability and the ease of switching to and doing business with allstate  as well as highlighting our comprehensive product and coverage options 
at allstate we differentiate ourselves from competitors by offering a comprehensive range of product options as well as product customization  including allstate your choice auto yca with options such as safe driving deductibles and a safe driving bonus 
we will continue to focus on developing and introducing products and services that further differentiate allstate and enhance the customer experience 
we will broaden customer relationships by identifying the greatest cross sell opportunities such as auto sales to our million monoline property customers and expanding sales of our emerging business and allstate financial products 
within our multiple distribution channels we are undergoing a focused effort to enhance our capabilities by implementing uniform processes and standards to elevate the level and consistency of the customer experience 
we continue to enhance technology to integrate our distribution channels  improve customer service  facilitate the introduction of new products and services and reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies and handling claims 
these actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution and service channels by increasing the productivity of the allstate brand s exclusive agencies and our direct channel 
our pricing and underwriting are designed to enhance both our competitive position and our profit potential 
we will provide and continue to enhance a range of discounts to attract more high lifetime value customer segments 
for example  we implemented a new auto discount the preferred package discount  which was available in states by the end of  for the high lifetime value customer segment 
we also increased the discount our homeowners customers receive if they insure their automobiles with allstate 
pricing sophistication  which underlies our strategic risk management program  uses a number of risk evaluation factors including insurance scoring  to the extent permissible by regulations  based on information that is obtained from credit reports 
for allstate brand auto and homeowners business  we continue to improve our mix of customers towards those who we consider high lifetime value that generally are homeowners that insure multiple autos with us  have better retention and more favorable loss experience 
our strategy for the encompass brand includes enhancing our premier package policy a product providing customers with the ability to simplify their insurance needs by consolidating their coverage into one policy  one bill  one premium and one renewal date  increasing distribution effectiveness and improving agency technology interfaces to become the package carrier of choice for aligned agencies and generate stable  consistent earnings growth 
the allstate protection segment also includes a separate organization called emerging businesses which is comprised of business insurance commercial products for small business owners  consumer household specialty products including motorcycles  boats  renters and condominium insurance policies  allstate dealer services insurance and non insurance products sold primarily to auto dealers  allstate roadside services retail and wholesale roadside assistance products and ivantage insurance agency 
premiums written by emerging businesses  through all channels including the direct channel  were billion in we expect to accelerate profitable growth in emerging businesses during we continue to manage our property catastrophe exposure in order to provide our shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the variability of our earnings  while providing protection to our customers 
our property business includes personal homeowners  commercial property and other property lines 
at december   we continue to be within our goal to have no more than a likelihood of exceeding our expected annual aggregate catastrophe losses by billion  net of reinsurance  from hurricanes and earthquakes  based on modeled assumptions and applications currently available 
the use of different assumptions and updates to industry models could materially change the projected loss 
property catastrophe exposure management includes purchasing reinsurance in areas that have known exposure to hurricanes  earthquakes  wildfires  fires following earthquakes and other catastrophes 
we are working for changes in the regulatory environment  including recognizing the need for and improving appropriate risk based pricing and promoting the creation of government sponsored  privately funded solutions for mega catastrophes 
while the actions that we take will be primarily focused on reducing the catastrophe exposure in our property business  we also consider their impact on our ability to market our auto lines 
pricing of property products is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a long term period 
losses  including losses from catastrophic events and weather related losses such as wind  hail  lightning and freeze losses not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period 
therefore  in any reporting period  loss experience from catastrophic events and weather related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products pricing 
additionally  property products are more capital intensive than other personal lines products 
allstate protection outlook allstate protection will emphasize attracting and retaining high lifetime value customers while maintaining pricing discipline 
we expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting results  however  this volatility will be mitigated due to our catastrophe management actions  including the purchase of reinsurance 
we will continue to study the efficiencies of our operations and cost structure for additional areas where costs may be reduced 
premiums written  an operating measure  is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period 
premiums earned is a gaap measure 
premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period 
the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our consolidated statements of financial position 
since the allstate brand policy periods are typically months for auto and months for homeowners  and the encompass standard auto and homeowners policy periods are typically months and non standard auto policy periods are typically months  rate changes will generally be recognized in premiums earned over a period of to months

catastrophe losses in were billion as detailed in the table below 
this compares to catastrophe losses in of billion 
we define a catastrophe as an event that produces pre tax losses before reinsurance in excess of million and involves multiple first party policyholders  or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset  per event threshold of average claims in a specific area  occurring within a certain amount of time following the event 
catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds  winter storms  tornadoes  hailstorms  wildfires  tropical storms  hurricanes  earthquakes and volcanoes 
we are also exposed to man made catastrophic events  such as certain acts of terrorism or industrial accidents 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any future period cannot be reliably predicted 
catastrophe losses related to events that occurred by the size of the event are shown in the following table 
in millions number of events claims and claims expense combined ratio impact average catastrophe loss per event size of catastrophe million to million million to million less than million total prior year reserve reestimates total catastrophe losses in the years through  we incurred catastrophe losses of billion related to events

standard auto loss ratio for the allstate brand increased points in compared to due to higher claim frequencies 
in  claim frequencies in the physical damage and bodily injury coverages have returned to historical norms following exceptionally low levels in bodily injury severity results increased in line with historical consumer price index cpi trends 
claims severity decreased in for the physical damage coverages  partially offsetting the increased frequencies

excluding catastrophes  the underlying inflationary increase in severity was in part offset by declines in frequency  reflecting a continuation of a long term decline in frequency and a decrease in miles driven 
non standard auto loss ratio for the allstate brand increased points in compared to due to higher claim frequencies 
claim frequencies increased for both physical damage and casualty coverages in compared to bodily injury severity results increased in line with historical cpi trends 
claims severity decreased in for the physical damage coverages  partially offsetting the increased frequencies 
non standard auto loss ratio for the allstate brand increased points in compared to due to lower favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years  increased catastrophe losses and higher claim severities  partially offset by lower claim frequencies 
homeowners loss ratio for the allstate brand decreased points to in from in due to lower catastrophe losses  partially offset by higher frequencies excluding catastrophes and severities

expense ratio for allstate protection decreased points in compared to restructuring costs increased points over prior year  driven by claim office consolidations  reorganization of business insurance and technology prioritization and efficiency efforts 
excluding restructuring  the expense ratio for allstate protection decreased points in compared to the impact of lower earned premium was offset by improved operational efficiencies and more focused spending  particularly on technology  and decreases in the net cost of benefits due to favorable investment results 
the expense ratio for allstate protection increased points in compared to primarily due to lower earned premiums  increases in the net cost of benefits due to unfavorable investment results  and charges for the write off of capitalized computer software 
the impact of specific costs and expenses on the expense ratio are included in the following tables 
allstate brand encompass brand allstate protection amortization of dac other costs and expenses restructuring and related charges total expense ratio the expense ratio for the standard auto and homeowners businesses generally approximates the total allstate protection expense ratio 
the expense ratio for the non standard auto business generally is lower than the total allstate protection expense ratio due to lower agent commission rates and higher average premiums for non standard auto as compared to standard auto 
the encompass brand dac amortization is higher on average than allstate brand dac amortization due to higher commission rates 
dac we establish a dac asset for costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business  principally agents remuneration  premium taxes  certain underwriting costs and direct mail solicitation expenses 
for the allstate protection business  dac is amortized to income over the period in which premiums are earned 
the balance of dac for each product type at december  is included in the following table

however  this average does not reflect the impact of some of the more significant actions we have taken to limit our catastrophe exposure 
consequently  it is useful to consider the impact of catastrophes after excluding losses that are now partially or substantially covered by the california earthquake authority cea  the florida hurricane catastrophe fund fhcf or placed with a third party  such as hurricane coverage in hawaii 
the average annual impact of all catastrophes  excluding losses from hurricanes andrew and iniki and losses from california earthquakes  on our property liability loss ratio was points since the beginning of comparatively  the average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio for the years through is shown in the following table 
average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio excluding losses from hurricanes andrew and iniki  and losses from california earthquakes florida other hurricane exposure states total hurricane exposure states all other total over time  we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes 
limitations include our participation in various state facilities  such as the cea  which provides insurance for california earthquake losses  the fhcf  which provides reimbursements to participating insurers for certain qualifying florida hurricane losses  and other state facilities  such as wind pools 
however  the impact of these actions may be diminished by the growth in insured values  and the effect of state insurance laws and regulations 
in addition  in various states we are required to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers 
because of our participation in these and other state facilities such as wind pools  we may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities and or to assessments from these facilities 
we continue to take actions to maintain an appropriate level of exposure to catastrophic events  including the following we have increased our utilization of wind storm pools 
for example  in texas we are ceding significant wind exposure related to insured property located in wind pool eligible areas along the coast including the galveston islands 
we have ceased writing new homeowners business in california 
we will continue to renew current policyholders and have a renewal ratio of approximately in california 
encompass floridian insurance company and encompass floridian indemnity company filed a formal notification with the florida office of insurance regulation to discontinue providing property insurance in the state of florida 
we ceased offering renewals on certain homeowners insurance policies in new york in certain down state geographical locations 
the level of non renewals in new york is limited by state statute 
hurricanes we consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes generally to be major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the united states 
usually  the average premium on a property policy near these coasts is greater than in other areas 
however  average premiums are not considered commensurate with the inherent risk of loss 
in addition and as explained in note of the consolidated financial statements  in various states allstate is subject to assessments from assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations providing insurance for wind related property losses 
we have addressed our risk of hurricane loss by  among other actions  purchasing reinsurance for specific states and on a countrywide basis for our personal lines property insurance in areas most exposed to hurricanes for further information on our reinsurance program see the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md a  limiting personal homeowners new business writings in coastal areas in southern and eastern states  and not offering continuing coverage on certain policies in coastal counties in certain states 
our actions are expected to continue during in northeastern and certain other hurricane prone states 
earthquakes actions taken to reduce our exposure from earthquake coverage are substantially complete 
these actions included purchasing reinsurance on a countrywide basis and in the state of kentucky  no longer offering new optional earthquake coverage in most states  removing optional earthquake coverage upon renewal in most states  and entering into arrangements in many states to make earthquake coverage available through other insurers for new and renewal business 
we expect to retain approximately  pif with earthquake coverage due to regulatory and other reasons 
we also will continue to have exposure to earthquake risk on certain policies that do not specifically exclude coverage for earthquake losses  including our auto policies  and to fires following earthquakes 
allstate policyholders in the state of california are offered coverage through the cea  a privately financed  publicly managed state agency created to provide insurance coverage for earthquake damage 
allstate is subject to assessments from the cea under certain circumstances as explained in note of the consolidated financial statements 
fires following earthquakes actions taken related to our risk of loss from fires following earthquakes include changing homeowners underwriting requirements in california and purchasing additional reinsurance on a countrywide basis excluding florida and on a statewide basis in california and kentucky 
wildfires actions we are taking to reduce our risk of loss from wildfires include changing homeowners underwriting requirements in certain states and including california wildfire losses in our aggregate excess reinsurance agreement and in our state specific california program

see the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md a for a more detailed discussion 
discontinued lines and coverages outlook we may continue to experience asbestos and or environmental losses in the future 
these losses could be due to the potential adverse impact of new information relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative  judicial and regulatory actions 
environmental losses may also increase as the result of additional funding for environmental site cleanup from the new federal government administration 
because of our annual grounds up review  we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available information  technology  laws and regulations 
we continue to be encouraged that the pace of industry asbestos claim activity has slowed  perhaps reflecting various state legislative and judicial actions with respect to medical criteria and increased legal scrutiny of the legitimacy of claims

property liability claims and claims expense reserves property liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability claims and claims expense reserves 
for a description of our reserve process  see note of the consolidated financial statements and for a further description of our reserving policies and the potential variability in our reserve estimates  see the application of critical accounting estimates section of the md a 
these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including ibnr claims  as of the reporting date 
the facts and circumstances leading to our quarterly reestimates of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid 
reestimates occur because actual losses are likely different than that predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates 
at december   the impact of a reserve reestimation corresponding to a one percent increase or decrease in net reserves would be a decrease or increase of approximately million in net income

in  this was primarily due to favorable reserve reestimates from hurricanes ike and gustav and a catastrophe related subrogation recovery 
the shift of reserves to older accident years is attributable to a reallocation of reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years  and a reclassification of injury and non injury reserves to older years 
in  this was primarily due to litigation filed in conjunction with a louisiana deadline for filing suits related to hurricane katrina 
in  this was primarily due to auto severity development that was better than expected  partially offset by unfavorable reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses 
these trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors  as previously described  used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid 
because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates  reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends based on the indications of updated development factor calculations

reserve reestimates for the discontinued lines and coverages  as shown in the table below  were increased primarily for other discontinued lines in both and  and environmental in in millions january reserves reserve reestimate january reserves reserve reestimate january reserves reserve reestimate asbestos claims environmental claims other discontinued lines total discontinued lines and coverages underwriting loss reserve reestimates as a of underwriting loss favorable reserve reestimates are shown in parentheses 
asbestos reserves reestimates in were million favorable 
reserve additions for asbestos in and  totaling million and million  respectively  were primarily for products related coverage 
for and  they were essentially a result of a continuing level of increased claim activity being reported by excess and primary insurance policyholders with existing active claims  excess policyholders with new claims  and reestimates of liabilities for increased assumed reinsurance cessions  as ceding companies other insurance carriers also experienced increased claim activity 
higher claim activity over prior estimates has also resulted in an increased estimate for future claims reported 
these trends are consistent with the trends of other carriers in the industry  which we believe are related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage  ongoing litigation and bankruptcy actions 
the asbestos reserve addition also includes the write off of uncollectible reinsurance for a single foreign reinsurer 
the reserve additions for environmental in were primarily related to site specific remediations where the clean up cost estimates and responsibility for the clean up were more fully determined 
normal environmental claim activity resulted in essentially no change in estimated reserves for the reserve additions for environmental in were for increased claim activity related to site specific remediations where the clean up cost estimates and responsibility for the clean up have been more fully determined 
this increased claim activity over prior estimates has also resulted in an increased estimate for future claims reported

this is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels 
many factors  such as mix of business  level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves  claim payments and the resultant ratio 
as payments result in corresponding reserve reductions  survival ratios can be expected to vary over time 
the net survival ratios in the table above have been adjusted to remove the claims and claims expense paid of million for asbestos and million for environmental attributable to recent commutation activity related to three reinsurers 
in  the asbestos net year survival ratio decreased due to lower reserve levels as the result of loss settlements 
in  the asbestos net year survival ratio increased due to lower average annual payments 
in  the environmental net year survival ratio increased due to lower average annual payments 
in  the environmental net year survival ratio declined due to continuing claim payments

we purchase significant reinsurance where we believe the greatest benefit may be achieved relative to our aggregate countrywide exposure 
the price and terms of reinsurance and the credit quality of the reinsurer are considered in the purchase process  along with whether the price can be appropriately reflected in the costs that are considered in setting future rates charged to policyholders 
we also participate in various reinsurance mechanisms  including industry pools and facilities  which are backed by the financial resources of the property liability insurance company market participants  and have historically purchased reinsurance to mitigate long tail liability lines  including environmental  asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures 
we retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers 
the impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for claims and claims expense at december are summarized in the following table  net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts 
in millions reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense reinsurance recoverables  net industry pools and facilities asbestos and environmental other including allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables total property liability reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of the amount of property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements  including incurred but not reported unpaid losses 
we calculate our ceded reinsurance estimate based on the terms of each applicable reinsurance agreement  including an estimate of how ibnr losses will ultimately be ceded under the agreement 
we also consider other limitations and coverage exclusions under our reinsurance agreements 
accordingly  our estimate of reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as our estimate of reserve for property liability claims and claims expense 
we believe the recoverables are appropriately established  however  as our underlying reserves continue to develop  the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded 
we regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts recoverable  and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed 
the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates 
changes in estimates could result in additional changes to the consolidated statements of operations 
the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance relates to discontinued lines and coverages reinsurance recoverables and was million and million at december  and  respectively 
these amounts represent and  respectively  of the related reinsurance recoverable balances 
the allowance is based upon our ongoing review of amounts outstanding  length of collection periods  changes in reinsurer credit standing  and other relevant factors 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business  we may become involved in coverage disputes with certain of our reinsurers which may ultimately result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against such reinsurers to determine the parties rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements 
we employ dedicated specialists to manage reinsurance collections and disputes 
we also consider recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants  and recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers in seeking to maximize our reinsurance recoveries 
adverse developments in the insurance industry have led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers  causing amounts recoverable from them and future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk 
there has also been consolidation activity in the industry  which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies 
in addition  over the last several years the industry has increasingly segregated asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital 
regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions 
we are unable to determine the impact  if any  that these developments will have on the collectability of reinsurance recoverables in the future

the net loss in compared to net income in was primarily the result of higher net realized capital losses and  to a lesser extent  dac and dsi amortization acceleration for changes in assumptions and additional amortization of dac that was recorded in connection with a premium deficiency assessment for traditional life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies due to revised annuity mortality assumptions 
analysis of revenues total revenues increased or billion in compared to due primarily to a billion decrease in net realized capital losses  partially offset by a million decline in net investment income 
total revenues decreased or billion in compared to due to a billion increase in net realized capital losses and a million decrease in net investment income 
life and annuity premiums and contract charges premiums represent revenues generated from traditional life insurance  immediate annuities with life contingencies  and accident and health insurance products that have significant mortality or morbidity risk 
contract charges are revenues generated from interest sensitive and variable life insurance and fixed annuities for which deposits are classified as contractholder funds or separate account liabilities 
contract charges are assessed against the contractholder account values for maintenance  administration  cost of insurance and surrender prior to contractually specified dates 
as a result  changes in contractholder funds are considered in the evaluation of growth and as indicators of future levels of revenues 
the following table summarizes life and annuity premiums and contract charges by product 
in millions premiums traditional life insurance immediate annuities with life contingencies accident and health total premiums contract charges interest sensitive life insurance fixed annuities bank and other total contract charges life and annuity premiums and contract charges beginning in  certain ceded reinsurance premiums previously included as a component of traditional life insurance premiums were reclassified prospectively to be reported as a component of interest sensitive life insurance contract charges 
in  these ceded reinsurance premiums were million 
total contract charges for  and include contract charges related to the cost of insurance totaling million  million and million  respectively 
total premiums increased in compared to due to higher sales of accident and health insurance and  to a lesser extent  increased renewal premium on traditional life insurance  partially offset by lower sales of immediate annuities with life contingencies 
the increased sales of accident and health insurance reflect growth through the allstate workplace division 
total premiums increased in compared to due to the prospective reporting reclassification for certain ceded reinsurance premiums 
excluding the impact of this reporting reclassification  total premiums decreased in compared to as higher sales of accident and health insurance and traditional life insurance products were more than offset by lower sales of immediate annuities with life contingencies due to highly competitive market conditions and our continued focus on returns 
total contract charges increased in compared to due primarily to higher contract charges on interest sensitive life insurance products resulting from increases in certain policy administration fees 
total contract charges decreased in compared to due to the prospective reporting reclassification for certain ceded reinsurance premiums 
excluding the impact of this reclassification  total contract charges increased in due to higher contract charges on interest sensitive life insurance policies resulting from increased contract charge rates and growth in business in force  partially offset by decreased contract charges on fixed annuities resulting primarily from lower contract surrenders 
contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of individual and institutional products  such as interest sensitive life insurance  fixed annuities  funding agreements and bank deposits 
the balance of contractholder funds is equal to the cumulative deposits received and interest credited to the contractholder less cumulative contract maturities  benefits  surrenders  withdrawals and contract charges for mortality or administrative expenses

contractholder funds decreased  and in  and  respectively 
average contractholder funds decreased in compared to and in compared to contractholder deposits decreased in compared to because there were no issuances of institutional products in compared to billion in the prior year and due to lower deposits on fixed annuities in sales of our institutional products vary from period to period based on management s assessment of market conditions  investor demand and operational priorities such as our focus beginning in on reducing our concentration in spread based products 
deposits on fixed annuities decreased in compared to due to pricing actions to improve returns on new business and reduce our concentration in spread based products 
contractholder deposits increased in compared to due primarily to higher deposits on institutional products  and to a lesser extent  higher deposits on fixed annuities and allstate bank products 
deposits on fixed annuities increased in compared to due primarily to increased consumer demand as the attractiveness of fixed annuities relative to competing products improved  partially offset by pricing decisions aimed to increase new business returns 
maturities and retirements of institutional products decreased to billion in from billion in the decrease was primarily due to lower retirements of extendible institutional market obligations in compared to  partially offset by the redemption in of billion of institutional product liabilities in accordance with cash tender offers announced in may to reduce the amount of our outstanding obligations and related interest credited expense 
during  we retired all of our remaining outstanding extendible institutional market obligations totaling billion 
this compares to retirements of extendible institutional market obligations of billion in maturities and retirements of institutional products increased billion in compared to due to the retirement of billion of extendible institutional market obligations for which investors had elected to non extend their maturity date through a combination of maturities  calls  and acquisitions in the secondary market 
surrenders and partial withdrawals on deferred fixed annuities  interest sensitive life insurance products and allstate bank products including maturities of certificates of deposit decreased to billion in from billion in due to lower surrenders and partial withdrawals on traditional fixed annuities  partially offset by higher surrenders and partial withdrawals on market value adjusted annuities and interest sensitive life insurance 
surrenders and partial withdrawals on deferred fixed annuities  interest sensitive life insurance products and allstate bank products decreased to billion in from billion in due to lower surrenders and partial withdrawals on market value adjusted annuities and traditional fixed annuities  partially offset by higher surrenders and partial withdrawals on interest sensitive life insurance products and  to a lesser extent  increased withdrawals on allstate bank products

lower yields were particularly impacted by short term and variable rate assets 
net investment income decreased in compared to the decline in was primarily due to lower investment yields on floating rate securities  increased short term investment balances reflecting liquidity management activities  lower average investment balances and lower income from limited partnership interests

analysis of costs and expenses total costs and expenses decreased or million in compared to due primarily to lower interest credited to contractholder funds and operating costs and expenses  partially offset by higher amortization of dac and restructuring and related charges 
total costs and expenses decreased or million in compared to due to lower interest credited to contractholder funds  partially offset by higher amortization of dac  contract benefits and operating costs and expenses 
life and annuity contract benefits increased or million in compared to due to higher contract benefits on life insurance products and accident and health insurance business  partially offset by lower contract benefits on annuities 
the increase in contract benefits on life insurance products was primarily due to higher mortality experience on interest sensitive life insurance products resulting from an increase in claim experience and policy growth while higher contract benefits on accident and health insurance business was proportionate to growth in premiums 
the decrease in contract benefits for annuities was due to improved mortality experience and the impact of lower sales of immediate annuities with life contingencies 
life and annuity contract benefits increased or million in compared to due primarily to higher contract benefits on life insurance products  partially offset by lower contract benefits on annuities 
the increase in contract benefits on life insurance products was primarily due to unfavorable mortality experience  partially offset by the recognition in of litigation related costs in the form of additional policy benefits 
the decline in contract benefits on annuities was due to the impact of lower sales of immediate annuities with life contingencies  partially offset by unfavorable mortality experience 
we analyze our mortality and morbidity results using the difference between premiums and contract charges earned for the cost of insurance and life and annuity contract benefits excluding the portion related to the implied interest on immediate annuities with life contingencies benefit spread 
this implied interest totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the benefit spread by product group is disclosed in the following table 
in millions life insurance accident and health annuities total benefit spread to conform to the current year presentation  certain amounts in the prior years have been reclassified

amortization of dsi in and was million and million  respectively 
the increase primarily includes an unfavorable change in amortization relating to realized capital gains and losses of million  partially offset by a million decline in amortization acceleration due to changes in assumptions  which in and increased interest credited to contractholder funds by million and million  respectively 
interest credited to contractholder funds decreased or million in compared to due primarily to a decline in average contractholder funds  decreased weighted average interest crediting rates on institutional products resulting from a decline in market interest rates on floating rate obligations  and a favorable change in amortization of dsi relating to realized capital gains and losses  partially offset by the acceleration of amortization of dsi due to changes in assumptions 
the acceleration of amortization of dsi due to changes in assumptions increased interest credited to contractholder funds by million in compared to amortization deceleration which decreased interest credited to contractholder funds by million in in order to analyze the impact of net investment income and interest credited to contractholders on net income  we monitor the difference between net investment income and the sum of interest credited to contractholder funds and the implied interest on immediate annuities with life contingencies  which is included as a component of life and annuity contract benefits on the consolidated statements of operations investment spread

the increase of million in compared to was due primarily to amortization acceleration relating to changes in assumptions and additional amortization recorded in connection with a premium deficiency assessment for traditional life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies  partially offset by higher accretion of dac relating to net realized capital losses 
the impact of realized capital gains and losses on amortization of dac is dependent upon the relationship between the assets that give rise to the gain or loss and the product liability supported by the assets 
fluctuations result from changes in the impact of realized capital gains and losses on actual and expected gross profits 
in  dac amortization relating to realized capital gains and losses resulted primarily from realized capital gains on derivatives 
additionally  dac amortization reflects our decision in the second half of not to recapitalize dac for credit losses on investments supporting certain fixed annuities following concerns that an increase in the level of expected realized capital losses in and may reduce egp and adversely impact the product dac recoverability 
in  dac accretion resulted primarily from realized capital losses on derivatives and other than temporary impairment losses 
despite the recent improvement in the credit markets and the overall economy  the cumulative impact of realized capital losses through december  has negatively impacted both the actual and expected gross profits of our fixed annuity business 
in the fourth quarter of  we reviewed and updated the gross profit assumptions used in substantially all of our fixed annuity dac models to exclude excess realized capital losses when determining gross profits used for calculating dac amortization 
this is consistent with our decision not to record negative amortization related to realized capital losses for these fixed annuities  which is expected to be our practice during periods when realized capital losses are reported 
this treatment results in a lower dac amortization rate for these fixed annuities 
the lower rate of amortization will be applied to a higher level of actual gross profits  as gross profits used to determine dac amortization will exclude excess realized capital losses 
the dac adjustment relating to unrealized capital gains and losses disclosed in footnote to the table that follows this discussion represents the amount by which the amortization of dac would increase or decrease if the unrealized gains or losses in the respective product portfolios were realized 
the dac adjustment balance  subject to limitations  is determined by applying the dac amortization rate to unrealized net capital gains or losses 
the fixed annuity dac adjustment for unrealized capital gains and losses declined as of december  as a result of lower unrealized capital losses and the lower rate of dac amortization used for certain fixed annuities discussed above 
changes in the dac adjustment balance relating to unrealized capital gains and losses are reported through other comprehensive income 
our annual comprehensive review of the profitability of our products to determine dac balances for our interest sensitive life  fixed annuities and other investment contracts covers assumptions for investment returns  including capital gains and losses  interest crediting rates to policyholders  the effect of any hedges  persistency  mortality and expenses in all product lines 
in the first quarter of  the review resulted in an acceleration of dac amortization charge to income of million pre tax 
million related to fixed annuities  of which million was attributable to market value adjusted annuities  and million related to variable life insurance 
partially offsetting these amounts was amortization deceleration credit to income for interest sensitive life insurance of million 
the principal assumption impacting egp and the related dac amortization was an increase in the level of expected realized capital losses in and this resulted in the majority of the market value adjusted annuity dac balance being reduced to zero since the products in force were estimated to have no gross profits 
market value adjusted annuity dac on these inforce contracts will not be recapitalized while there are no estimated gross profits 
reduced egp for traditional fixed annuities and variable life insurance resulted in accelerated dac amortization 
for our interest sensitive life insurance products  the amortization deceleration was due to higher egp due to a favorable change in our mortality assumptions  partially offset by increased expected capital losses 
in  dac amortization acceleration for changes in assumptions recorded in connection with comprehensive reviews of the dac balances resulted in an increase to amortization of dac of million 
the principle assumption impacting the amortization acceleration in was the level of realized capital losses impacting actual gross profits in and the impact of realized capital losses on egp in during the fourth quarter of  our assumptions for egp were impacted by a view of higher impairments in our investment portfolio 
in  dac amortization deceleration for changes in assumptions credit to income was million 
during  indicators emerged that suggested a study of mortality experience for our immediate annuities with life contingences was warranted 
at the same time  the underlying profitability of the traditional life insurance business deteriorated due to lower investment returns and growth 
for traditional life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies  an aggregate premium deficiency of million  pre tax  resulted primarily from the experience study indicating that the annuitants on certain life contingent contracts are projected to live longer than we anticipated when the contracts were issued and  to a lesser degree  a reduction in the related investment portfolio yield 
the deficiency was recorded through a reduction in dac 
there was no similar charge to income recorded in or the changes in the dac asset are detailed in the following table

non deferrable acquisition costs decreased or million in compared to primarily due to lower non deferrable commissions 
other operating costs and expenses increased or million in compared to due primarily to increased spending on consumer research  product development  marketing and technology related to the effort to reinvent protection and retirement for consumers as well as increases in the net cost of benefits due to unfavorable investment results 
in addition  benefitted to a greater degree from a servicing fee paid by prudential financial inc prudential for our servicing of the variable annuity business that we ceded to them during a transition period beginning in which ended in may during  restructuring and related charges of million were recorded in connection with our previously announced plan to improve efficiency and narrow our focus of product offerings 
in accordance with this plan  among other actions  we continue to anticipate the reduction of approximately  workforce positions relative to december  levels through a combination of attrition  position elimination and outsourcing 
this reduction reflects approximately of allstate financial s work force at the time the plan was initiated 
reductions in workforce positions combined with other actions completed as of december  reflect approximately of our targeted annual savings of million beginning in income tax benefit of million was recognized for compared to a benefit of million for and income tax expense of million for the decrease in the benefit of million in was mostly attributable to the decline in the pre tax net loss 
income tax benefit for includes expense of million attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance relating to the deferred tax asset on capital losses recorded in the first quarter of this valuation allowance was released in connection with the adoption of new otti accounting guidance on april   however  the release was recorded as an increase to retained income and therefore did not reverse the amount recorded in income tax benefit 
for further discussion of changes in this valuation allowance see the deferred taxes section of the md a 
the change to an income tax benefit in compared to income tax expense in reflects the shift from net pre tax income in to a net pre tax loss in reinsurance ceded we enter into reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurers to limit our risk of mortality and morbidity losses

net realized capital losses were billion in during  our fixed income and mortgage loan portfolio generated cash flows totaling billion which increased our flexibility to take advantage of market opportunities and manage liabilities 
over the last three quarters of we deployed approximately billion of short term investments and cash receipts into securities  primarily fixed income and equity securities  to generate income and capital appreciation 
investments overview and strategy the return on our investment portfolios is an important component of our financial results 
investment portfolios are segmented between the property liability  allstate financial and corporate and other operations 
while taking into consideration the investment portfolio in aggregate  we manage the underlying portfolios based upon the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability structure 
we employ a strategic asset allocation approach which uses models that consider the nature of the liabilities and risk tolerances  as well as the risk and return parameters of the various asset classes in which we invest 
this asset allocation is informed by our global economic and market outlook  as well as other inputs and constraints  including diversification effects  duration  liquidity and capital considerations 
we will continue to manage risks associated with rising interest rates  equity market declines  commercial real estate and municipal bonds 
the property liability portfolio s investment strategy emphasizes protection of principal and consistent income generation  within a total return framework 
this approach  which has produced competitive returns over the long term  is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims  while maximizing economic value and surplus growth 
the allstate financial portfolio s investment strategy focuses on the total return of assets needed to support the underlying liabilities and to achieve an appropriate return on capital 
within the ranges set by the strategic asset allocation model  tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions 
the corporate and other portfolio s investment strategy balances the pursuit of competitive returns with the unique liquidity needs of the portfolio in relation to the overall corporate capital structure 
the portfolio is primarily invested in high quality  liquid fixed income and short term securities with additional investments in less liquid holdings in order to enhance overall returns 
risk mitigation we continue to focus our strategic risk mitigation efforts towards managing interest rate  equity  credit and real estate investment risks  while our return optimization efforts focus on investing in market opportunities to generate income and capital appreciation 
as a result  during we took the following actions reduced our commercial real estate exposure by or billion of amortized cost primarily through targeted dispositions and principal repayments from borrowers 
sold billion of below investment grade assets primarily corporate fixed income securities and bank loans  as a result of improved market conditions 
reduced our municipal bond exposure by or billion of amortized cost primarily through targeted dispositions  refunding and scheduled maturities 
managed our exposure to interest rate risk through macro hedging of tail risk and reductions in duration 
duration of the investment portfolio  including the effects of derivatives  declined by approximately 
years over the twelve month period 
the decline in duration was the result of proceeds from asset dispositions being reinvested in shorter duration assets and through the use of interest rate derivatives 
our investment portfolio duration is managed in relation to the liabilities of our business segments 
maintained risk mitigation programs that protected our portfolios through macro hedges against interest rate and equity market risk 
the appreciation in fair values for fixed income and equity securities significantly exceeded the realized losses of million from derivatives used for macro hedging programs 
investments outlook for  the economies of the us and other developed countries continue to face significant resistance with expectations for limited domestic growth  but with better prospects for growth in developing or emerging economies and markets 
financial markets are anticipated to see moderate returns for fixed income and equities with periods of higher volatility throughout the year  and moderate widening of credit spreads 
we also expect continued weakness in commercial real estate fundamentals 
in  our return optimization and risk mitigation efforts will focus on the following areas optimizing our allocation of assets to reflect changes in allstate financial s liabilities 
continuing to explore global investments in areas of emerging opportunity with higher prospects for growth 
balancing our ongoing efforts to mitigate interest rate and equity risks  including continuing our macro hedge program  with near term income enhancement opportunities 
managing our exposure to overall credit risk while managing and selectively reducing exposures to commercial real estate and municipal bonds 
as a result of these actions  market conditions  and allstate financial s strategic initiatives invested assets are expected to decline in line with reductions in contractholder obligations 
our portfolio will continue to generate significant cash flow from maturities  principal and interest receipts which will be available to manage liabilities and pursue market opportunities

total investments increased to billion at december   from billion at december   due primarily to higher valuations for fixed income and equity securities from improved market conditions and operating cash flows that more than offset net reductions in contractholder obligations of billion 
fair values of fixed income securities increased as a result of significant tightening in credit spreads that more than offset a rise in risk free interest rates 
credit spread is the additional yield on fixed income securities above the risk free rate typically defined as the yield on us treasury securities that market participants require to compensate them for assuming credit  liquidity and or prepayment risks 
credit spreads vary ie  increase or decrease in response to the market s perception of risk and liquidity in a specific issuer or specific sector 
the property liability investment portfolio increased to billion at december   from billion at december   primarily due to higher valuations for fixed income and equity securities from improved market conditions and operating cash flows 
the allstate financial investment portfolio increased to billion at december   from billion at december   primarily due to higher valuations for fixed income securities from improved market conditions and capital contributions of million from the corporation and aic that was almost entirely offset by net reductions in contractholder obligations of billion primarily from maturities and retirements of institutional products 
the corporate and other investment portfolio decreased to billion at december   from billion at december   as dividends paid to shareholders  capital contributions to alic and repayment of million of debt more than offset the proceeds of the billion of senior notes issued in may and higher valuations for fixed income securities from improved market conditions

our practices for acquiring and monitoring municipal bonds primarily are based on the credit quality of the primary obligor 
as of december   we believe valuations substantially reflected the decline in the value of the insurance  and further related valuation declines  if any  are not expected to be material 
while the valuation of these holdings may be temporarily impacted by negative market developments  we expect to receive all of the contractual cash flows

corporate bonds  including publicly traded  privately placed and hybrid securities  totaled billion as of december  with an unrealized net capital gain of million 
privately placed securities primarily consist of corporate issued senior debt securities that are in unregistered form or are directly negotiated with the borrower 
privately placed corporate securities are rated by the naic in instances when information is provided to them 
of the privately placed corporate securities in our portfolio are rated by an independent rating agency 
our portfolio of privately placed securities are broadly diversified by issuer  industry sector and country 
the portfolio is made up of issuers with each issue averaging million 
privately placed corporate obligations generally have higher yields and contain structural security features such as financial covenants and call protections that provide investors greater protection against credit deterioration  reinvestment risk or fluctuations in interest rates than those typically found in publicly registered debt securities 
additionally  investments in these securities are made after extensive due diligence of the issuer  typically including direct discussions with senior management and on site visits to company facilities 
ongoing monitoring includes direct periodic dialog with senior management of the issuer and continuous monitoring of operating performance and financial position 
every issue not rated by an independent rating agency is internally rated with a formal rating affirmation approximately once a year 
the following table shows details of hybrid securities as of december  in millions public privately placed total fair value unrealized gain loss fair value unrealized gain loss fair value unrealized gain loss united kingdom uk europe non uk asia australia north america total hybrid securities have attributes most similar to those of fixed income securities such as stated interest rates  mandatory redemption dates or an interest rate step up feature which is intended to incent the issuer to redeem the security at a specified call date 
hybrid securities include publicly traded and privately placed securities 
while hybrid securities are generally issued by investment grade rated financial institutions  they have structural features which make them more sensitive to credit market deterioration 
specifically  features allowing deferral of payment have significantly impacted prices as the issuers continue to be impacted by the stress in the global financial system 
billion of our hybrid securities with million of unrealized net capital losses are tier securities  and million with million of unrealized net capital losses are tier securities 
tier securities are lower in the capital structure than tier securities 
foreign government securities totaled billion  with rated investment grade  at december  of these securities  are backed by the us government  are in canadian governmental securities held in our canadian subsidiary and the remaining are highly diversified in other foreign governments 
rmbs  cmbs and abs are structured securities that are primarily collateralized by residential and commercial real estate related loans and other consumer related borrowings 
the cash flows are generally applied in a pre determined order and are designed so that each security issued qualifies for a specific original rating 
the security issue is typically referred to as the class 
for example  the senior portion or top of the capital structure  or rating class  which would originally qualify for a rating of aaa typically has priority in receiving the principal repayments on the collateral 
in a sequential structure  underlying collateral principal repayments are directed to the most senior rated aaa class in the structure until paid in full  after which principal repayments are directed to the next most senior aaa class in the structure until it is paid in full 
senior aaa classes generally share any losses from the underlying collateral on a pro rata basis after losses are absorbed by classes with lower original ratings and include other junior or subordinate securities 
the collateral can have fixed interest rates  variable interest rates such as adjustable rate mortgages arm or may contain features of both fixed and variable rate mortgages 
rmbs  including us agency  prime  alt a and subprime totaled billion  with rated investment grade  at december  the rmbs portfolio is subject to interest rate risk  but unlike other fixed income securities  is additionally subject to significant prepayment risk from the underlying mortgages 
the credit risk associated with our rmbs is mitigated due to the fact that of the portfolio consists of securities that were issued by  or have underlying collateral that is guaranteed by  us government agencies 
the unrealized net capital loss of billion at december  on our rmbs portfolio was the result of wider credit spreads than at initial purchase on non us agency securities  which is largely due to the macroeconomic conditions and credit market deterioration  including the impact of real estate valuations  that persisted throughout the following table shows our rmbs portfolio at december  based upon vintage year

as of december   million of the alt a were fixed rate and million were variable rate 
subprime includes securities that are collateralized by mortgage loans issued to borrowers that cannot qualify for prime or alt a financing terms due in part to weak or limited credit history 
it also includes securities that are collateralized by certain second lien mortgages regardless of the borrower s credit history 
the subprime portfolio consisted of billion and million of first lien and second lien securities  respectively 
subprime included million of fixed rate and million of variable rate securities 
at december   million or of the total subprime securities are insured by seven bond insurers 
cmbs totaled billion  with rated investment grade  at december  the cmbs portfolio is subject to credit risk  but unlike certain other structured securities  is generally not subject to prepayment risk due to protections within the underlying commercial mortgages whereby borrowers are effectively restricted from prepaying their mortgages due to changes in interest rates 
of the cmbs investments  are traditional conduit transactions collateralized by pools of commercial mortgages  broadly diversified across property types and geographical area 
the remainder consists of non traditional cmbs such as small balance transactions  large loan pools and single borrower transactions 
the following table shows our cmbs portfolio at december  based upon vintage year 
in millions fair value unrealized gain loss pre total cmbs the unrealized net capital loss of million at december  on our cmbs portfolio was the result of wider credit spreads than at initial purchase  which is largely due to the macroeconomic conditions and credit market deterioration  including the impact of real estate valuations  that persisted throughout while cmbs spreads tightened during  credit spreads in most rating classes remain wider than at initial purchase  which is particularly evident in our vintage year subordinated senior aaa and non traditional cmbs  as well as our vintage year aa and lower rated securities 
these holdings accounted for million  or  of the unrealized net capital loss 
abs  including cdo and consumer and other abs  totaled billion  with rated investment grade  at december  credit risk is managed by monitoring the performance of the collateral 
in addition  many of the securities in the abs portfolio are credit enhanced with features such as overcollateralization  subordinated structures  reserve funds  guarantees and or insurance 
a portion of the abs portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk since price volatility and the ultimate realized yields are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying assets 
the unrealized net capital loss of million at december  on our abs portfolio was the result of wider credit spreads than at initial purchase 
cdo totaled billion  with rated investment grade  at december  cdo consist primarily of obligations secured by high yield and investment grade corporate credits including billion of cash flow collateralized loan obligations clo and million of synthetic cdo with unrealized losses of million and million  respectively 
the remaining million of securities consisted of trust preferred cdo  market value cdo  project finance cdo  cdos that invest in cdos  collateralized bond obligations and other clo with unrealized losses of million 
cash flow clo are structures where the underlying assets are primarily comprised of below investment grade senior secured corporate loans 
the collateral is actively managed by external managers that monitor the collateral performance 
the underlying investments are well diversified across industries and among issuers 
a transaction will typically issue notes with various capital structure classes ie aaa  aa  a  etc 
as well as equity like tranches 
in general  these securities are structured with overcollateralization ratios and performance is impacted by downgrades  defaults and recoveries of the underlying assets within the structures 
downgrades of underlying assets  along with increased defaults reduce overcollateralization ratios over time 
a violation of the senior overcollateralization test could result in an event of default of the structure 
this would give the controlling class  defined as the majority of the senior lenders  certain rights which could include diverting cash flows or liquidating the underlying portfolio to pay off the senior liabilities 
synthetic cdo primarily consist of a portfolio of corporate credit default swaps cds which are collateralized by aaa rated libor based securities ie fully funded synthetic cdo 
our synthetic cdo collateral primarily is actively managed by external managers monitoring the cds selection and performance 
consumer and other abs totaled billion  with rated investment grade  at december  consumer and other abs consists of million of auto  million of student loan  million of credit card and million of other securities with unrealized gains of million  and unrealized losses of million  million and million  respectively 
at december   million or of consumer and other abs securities are insured by five bond insurers 
equity securities equity securities include common stocks  real estate investment trust equity investments and non redeemable preferred stocks 
the equity securities portfolio was billion at december  compared to billion at december  the increase is attributable to purchases and increased equity valuations 
net unrealized gains totaled million at december  compared to net unrealized losses of million at december  mortgage loans our mortgage loan portfolio  which is primarily held in the allstate financial portfolio  totaled billion at december   compared to billion at december   and primarily comprised loans secured by first mortgages on developed commercial real estate 
key considerations used to manage our exposure include property type and geographic diversification 
our exposure to any metropolitan area is also highly diversified  with the largest exposure not exceeding of the portfolio 
the portfolio is diversified across several property types  with the largest concentrations of in office and in retail property types 
debt service coverage ratio represents the amount of cash flows from the property available to the borrower to meet principal and interest payment obligations 
the average debt service coverage ratio of the portfolio as of december  was  and of the mortgage loan portfolio had a debt service coverage ratio under mortgage loans with debt service coverage ratios below generally have a higher level of risk  with of these loans having valuation allowances totaling million 
mortgage loans with debt service coverage below for which valuation allowances have not been established  primarily relate to instances where the borrower has the financial capacity to fund the revenue shortfalls from the properties for the foreseeable term  the decrease in occupancy is considered temporary  or there are other risk mitigating circumstances such as additional collateral  escrow balances or borrower guarantees 
in  million of commercial mortgage loans were contractually due 
of these  were paid as due  were extended generally for less than one year  were refinanced and were foreclosed or in the process of foreclosure 
in addition  billion that were not contractually due in were paid in full 
we also currently have four loans totaling million that were not contractually due in that are in the process of foreclosure 
in total we have five loans totaling million that are in foreclosure 
we are aggressively pursuing workout solutions for all delinquent loans that are not in the process of foreclosure  which total million  including refinancing  extensions and sales 
we closely monitor our commercial mortgage loan portfolio on a loan by loan basis 
loans with an estimated collateral value less than the loan balance  as well as loans with other characteristics indicative of higher than normal credit risks  are reviewed at least quarterly for purposes of establishing valuation allowances and placing loans on non accrual status as necessary 
accrual of income is suspended for mortgage loans that are in default or when full and timely collection of principal and interest payments is not probable 
the underlying collateral values are based upon either discounted property cash flow projections or a commonly used valuation method that utilizes a one year projection of expected annual income divided by a market based expected rate of return 
the net carrying value of impaired loans at december  and was million and million  respectively 
total valuation allowances of million and million were held on impaired loans at december  and  respectively 
we recognized million of realized capital losses related to increases in the valuation allowances on impaired loans for the year ended december  primarily due to deteriorating debt service coverage resulting from a decrease in occupancy and the risk associated with refinancing near term maturities due to declining collateral valuations 
we recognized million of realized capital losses related to valuation allowances on impaired loans for the year ended december  realized capital losses recognized on mortgage loans held for sale totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

impairment write downs related to ema lp were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
limited partnership interests  excluding impairment write downs  produced losses of million in compared to losses of million in the loss from limited partnership interests in compared to is primarily related to losses from partnerships accounted for under the equity method of accounting resulting from lower net asset valuations of the real estate partnerships 
income on ema lp is recognized on a delay due to the availability of the related financial statements 
the recognition of income on hedge funds is primarily on a one month delay and the income recognition on private equity debt funds and real estate funds are generally on a three month delay 
limited partnership interests accounted for under the cost method of accounting recognize income only upon cash distributions by the partnership 
short term investments our short term investment portfolio was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in short term investments was primarily due to funding reductions in contractholder obligations and purchases of fixed income securities 
other investments our other investments as of december  are comprised primarily of billion of policy loans  million of certain derivatives and million of bank loans 
policy loans are carried at the unpaid principal balances 
bank loans are comprised primarily of senior secured corporate loans and are carried at amortized cost

unrealized net capital losses see note of the consolidated financial statements for further disclosures regarding unrealized losses on fixed income and equity securities and factors considered in determining whether securities are other than temporarily impaired 
unrealized net capital losses totaled billion as of december   compared to unrealized net capital losses of billion as of december  the improvement since december  for fixed income securities was primarily a result of tightening credit spreads on certain fixed income securities during that more than offset the rise in risk free interest rates 
the unrealized net capital gain for equity securities as of december  compared to unrealized net capital loss as of december  was a result of improvements in equity security valuations as a result of improving equity market conditions

the insurance reserves adjustment represents the amount by which the reserve balance would increase if the net unrealized gains in the applicable product portfolios were realized and reinvested at current lower interest rates  resulting in a premium deficiency 
although we evaluate premium deficiencies on the combined performance of our life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies  the adjustment primarily relates to structured settlement annuities with life contingencies  in addition to annuity buy outs and certain payout annuities with life contingencies 
the dac and dsi adjustment balance represents the amount by which the amortization of dac and dsi would increase or decrease if the unrealized gains or losses in the respective product portfolios were realized 
only the unrealized net capital gains and losses on the allstate financial fixed annuity and interest sensitive life product portfolios are used in this calculation 
the dac and dsi adjustment balance  subject to limitations  is determined by applying the dac and dsi amortization rate to unrealized net capital gains or losses 
recapitalization of the dac and dsi balances is limited to the originally deferred costs plus interest 
the dac and dsi adjustment balance was limited as of december  because the calculated amount  when added to the dac and dsi balance before the impact of unrealized capital gains and losses  was greater than originally deferred costs plus interest 
the dac and dsi adjustment balance is below the limitation as of december  the limitation amount changes from period to period based on changes in the dac and dsi balance before the impact of unrealized capital gains and losses  as well as new deferrals and interest 
the net unrealized loss for the fixed income portfolio totaled billion  comprised of billion of gross unrealized gains and billion of gross unrealized losses at december  this is compared to a net unrealized loss for the fixed income portfolio totaling billion  comprised of billion of gross unrealized gains and billion of gross unrealized losses at december  gross unrealized gains and losses as of december  on fixed income securities by type and sector are provided in the table below

similarly  excluding the impact of zero coupon securities  the percentage of fair value to par value would be for corporates  for municipals  for foreign governments and for us government and agencies 
the banking  financial services  utilities and consumer goods sectors had the highest concentration of gross unrealized losses in our corporate fixed income securities portfolio at december  while credit spreads have tightened in the last three quarters of from the historically high levels observed in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  they remain wider than at initial purchase for certain securities in the portfolio

the unrealized losses in these sectors were company and sector specific 
as of december   we have the intent and ability to hold our equity securities with unrealized losses until recovery 
other than temporary impairment evaluation we have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate each fixed income and equity security whose carrying value may be other than temporarily impaired 
the process includes a quarterly review of all securities through a screening process which identifies instances where the fair value compared to amortized cost for fixed income securities and cost for equity securities is below established thresholds  and also includes the monitoring of other criteria such as ratings  ratings downgrades or payment defaults 
the securities identified  in addition to other securities for which we may have a concern  are evaluated based on facts and circumstances for inclusion on our watch list 
all investments in an unrealized loss position at december  were included in our portfolio monitoring process for determining whether declines in value were other than temporary 
due to recent market conditions and liquidity concerns  as well as wider credit spreads than at initial purchase which persist in certain markets  particularly related to structured assets  the extent and duration of a decline in fair value have become less indicative of when the market may believe there has been credit deterioration with respect to an issue or issuer 
while we continue to use declines in fair value and the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position as indicators of potential credit deterioration  our determination of whether a security s decline in fair value is other than temporary has placed greater emphasis on our analysis of the underlying credit and collateral 
the following table summarizes fixed income and equity securities in a gross unrealized loss position according to significance  aging and investment grade classification

at december   gross unrealized losses resulting from factors other than credit on fixed income securities with other than temporary impairments for which we have recorded a credit loss in earnings are included as follows category i million  category ii million  category iii million  and category iv million 
categories i and ii have generally been adversely affected by overall economic conditions including interest rate increases and the market s evaluation of certain sectors 
the degree to which and or length of time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position does not suggest that these securities pose a high risk of being other than temporarily impaired 
the largest individual unrealized loss was million for category i and million for category ii as of december  gross unrealized losses on fixed income securities in category ii decreased billion since december  this change was primarily the result of improved market conditions resulting in higher valuations  which either caused a shift to category i or created an overall gross unrealized gain position 
the remainder of the reduction in category ii is a result of losses shifting into category iii and iv due to continued aging of losses in a continuous unrealized loss position of greater than or equal to of amortized cost and the resetting of unrealized losses to the historical point of impairment for securities impacted by the adoption of new otti accounting guidance on april  categories iii and iv are affected by macroeconomic and credit pressures upon real estate valuations and borrowers  and issue  issuer or industry specific conditions 
the degree to which and or length of time these securities have been in an unrealized loss position subject them to increased scrutiny through our portfolio monitoring process 
the largest individual unrealized loss was million for category iii and million for category iv as of december  category iii and iv fixed income securities at december  are listed in the following table by fixed income security type and investment quality classification 
in millions investment grade category iii category iv total fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses municipal corporate rmbs cmbs abs below investment grade category iii category iv total fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses municipal corporate rmbs cmbs abs total as of december   our gross unrealized losses in category iii and iv were primarily concentrated in structured securities  as we have experienced declines in fair value since the time of initial purchase 
as of december   rmbs  cmbs and abs comprised billion and billion of investment grade and below investment grade securities in category iii and iv  respectively 
consistent with their rating  our portfolio monitoring indicates that the investment grade securities have a relatively low risk of default 
securities rated below investment grade  whether at issue or upon subsequent downgrade  have a higher level of risk and can be more volatile 
a key consideration in the determination of other than temporary impairment for structured securities is whether the present value of loss adjusted cash flows from the underlying collateral will be sufficient to recover our amortized cost basis 
this evaluation focuses on the adequacy of credit enhancement relative to the performance of the underlying collateral  adjusted for projected defaults and prepayments 
credit enhancement includes  but is not limited to  structural subordination  guarantees and reserves 
key future collateral performance considerations include historical default prepayment trends  as well as projected macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates and interest rates 
in general  securities with credit enhancement in excess of projected loss adjusted collateral performance are deemed not other than temporarily impaired 
securities with deficient credit enhancement are deemed other than temporarily impaired and the difference between the estimated recovery value and amortized cost is recorded in earnings as a credit loss 
a description of the other than temporary impairment assessment for our rmbs and cmbs  which comprise a majority of our category iii and iv unrealized losses  follows the credit loss evaluation for non agency rmbs securities  including prime  alt a and subprime securities  primarily relies on projections of losses based on future collateral performance  taking into account security specific delinquency and loss severity trends on the underlying mortgage collateral to date 
the expected performance of each transaction considers projected collateral losses and credit enhancement levels  as well as an assessment of the origination practices of the transaction sponsor  geographic diversification  overall transaction structure  collateral type and quality  transaction vintage year and other considerations that may be of concern 
our default estimates on the underlying mortgage collateral are forward looking and generally based upon security specific performance trends to date as well as our overall economic outlook  with a focus on housing  unemployment and gdp expectations  and consider other factors that may influence future borrower behaviors 
our loss severity estimates are forward looking and incorporate estimates of future house price appreciation depreciation expectations and estimates of foreclosure timing and expenses 
the credit loss evaluation for cmbs primarily relies on model driven projections of future collateral performance  taking into account all reasonably available information specific to the underlying commercial mortgage loans including estimates of current and future property value  current and projected rental income and the credit enhancement levels 
estimates of future property value and rental income consider specific property type and metro area economic trends such as property vacancy rates and rental rates  employment indicators and building industry fundamentals 
other considerations include borrower payment history  the origination practices of the transaction sponsor  overall collateral quality and diversification  transaction vintage year  maturity date  overall structure of the transaction and other factors that may influence performance 
actual realized losses in the cmbs market have historically been low  therefore our projection of collateral performance is informed by credit opinions obtained from third parties  such as nationally recognized credit rating agencies  industry analysts and a cmbs loss modeling advisory service 
for structured securities deemed other than temporarily impaired  we recognized the estimated credit loss in earnings  while million of unrealized losses related to factors other than credit remains classified in oci 
structured securities deemed not other than temporarily impaired are current on contractual or expected payments and our detailed analysis of the underlying credit and related cash flows has concluded that our amortized cost basis is recoverable or the securities are reliably insured 
the declines in fair value are primarily due to credit spread widening in the structured security marketplace and increased liquidity discounts 
we believe that the unrealized losses on our fixed income securities are not predictive of their ultimate performance and the unrealized losses should reverse over the remaining lives of the securities 
we anticipate that these securities will recover in line with our best estimate of the expected cash flows which are used for other than temporary impairment evaluations as well as managing the portfolio 
as of december   we do not have the intent to sell and it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis 
our evaluation of whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost basis is supported by our liquidity position  which cushions us from the need to liquidate securities with significant unrealized losses to meet cash obligations 
additionally  whenever our initial analysis indicates that a fixed income security s unrealized loss of or more for at least months or any equity security s unrealized loss of or more for at least months is temporary  additional evaluations and management approvals are required to substantiate that the unrealized loss is related to other factors and recognition of a credit loss write down is not appropriate 
as of december   one perpetual preferred equity security with an unrealized loss of million met these criteria 
we also monitor the quality of our fixed income and bank loan portfolios by categorizing certain investments as problem  restructured  or potential problem 
problem fixed income securities and bank loans are in default with respect to principal or interest and or are investments issued by companies that have gone into bankruptcy subsequent to our acquisition or loan 
fixed income and bank loan investments are categorized as restructured when the debtor is in financial difficulty and we grant a concession 
potential problem fixed income or bank loan investments are current with respect to contractual principal and or interest  but because of other facts and circumstances  we have concerns regarding the borrower s ability to pay future principal and interest according to the original terms  which causes us to believe these investments may be classified as problem or restructured in the future 
the following table summarizes problem  restructured and potential problem fixed income securities and bank loans  which are reported in other investments  at december in millions par value amortized cost amortized cost as a percent of par value fair value fair value as a percent of par value percent of total fixed income and bank loan portfolios restructured problem potential problem total cumulative write downs recognized par value amortized cost amortized cost as a percent of par value fair value fair value as a percent of par value percent of total fixed income and bank loan portfolios restructured problem potential problem total cumulative write downs recognized the difference between par value and amortized cost of billion at december  and billion at december  is primarily attributable to write downs

ema lp income for periods prior to the fourth quarter of is reported in net investment income 
the amount of ema lp income included in net investment income was million in and million in net investment income decreased or billion in compared to  primarily due to lower yields  actions to shorten duration and maintain additional liquidity in the portfolio  along with reduced average investment balances 
lower yields were particularly impacted by short term and variable rate assets 
also contributing to the decline in was lower income on limited partnership interests and decreased dividends on equity securities 
during  our fixed income and mortgage loan portfolio continued to generate significant cash flows from maturities  principal and interest receipts totaling billion 
these cash flows increased our flexibility to take advantage of market opportunities and manage liabilities 
increased market stability drove a more positive market outlook and improved liquidity in the portfolios  which led us to deploy billion of short term investments and cash receipts into securities  primarily fixed income and equities  to generate income and capital appreciation 
total investment expenses decreased million in compared to the decrease was primarily due to lower expenses associated with a lower amount of collateral received in connection with securities lending transactions

impairment write downs for the years ended december are presented in the following table 
in millions fixed income securities equity securities mortgage loans limited partnership interests short term investments other investments impairment write downs impairment write downs in were primarily the result of recovery assessments related to investments with commercial real estate exposure  including limited partnership interests  equity securities  mortgage loans and cmbs  rmbs which experienced deterioration in expected cash flows  abs  including cdo squared  cash flow cdo and synthetic cdo  and hybrid corporate fixed income securities 
million of the fixed income security write downs in related to securities that were subsequently disposed 
of the remaining  million or of the fixed income security write downs in related to impaired securities that were performing in line with anticipated or contractual cash flows but were written down primarily because of expected deterioration in the performance of the underlying collateral or our assessment of the probability of future default 
for these securities  as of december   there have either been no defaults or defaults have only impacted classes lower than our position in the capital structure 
million of the fixed income security write downs in related to securities experiencing a significant departure from anticipated cash flows  however  we believe they retain economic value 
million in related to fixed income securities for which future cash flows are very uncertain 
hybrid corporate fixed income securities are assessed for other than temporary impairment as fixed income securities  when they are expected to perform like a fixed income security 
however  when credit related reasons increase the risk of deferred payment  they may be assessed for other than temporary impairment in a manner similar to equity securities 
in  hybrid securities issued primarily by european financial institutions were assessed as equity securities and written down for other than temporary impairment resulting in million of realized capital losses 
these hybrid securities that were still held as of december  had a fair value of million 
equity securities were written down primarily due to the length of time and extent fair value was below cost  considering our assessment of the financial condition  near term and long term prospects of the issuer  including relevant industry conditions and trends 
limited partnership impairment write downs related primarily to cost limited partnerships which experienced significant declines in portfolio valuations and we could not assert the recovery period would be temporary 
to determine if an other than temporary impairment has occurred related to a cost limited partnership  we evaluate whether an impairment indicator has occurred in the period that may have a significant adverse effect on the carrying value of the investment 
impairment indicators may include significantly reduced valuations of the investments held by the limited partnerships  actual recent cash flows received being significantly less than expected cash flows  reduced valuations based on financing completed at a lower value  completed sale of a material underlying investment at a price significantly lower than expected  or any other recent adverse events since the last financial statements received that might affect the fair value of the investee s capital

change in intent write downs for mortgage loans and other investments reflect instances where the loans have been classified as held for sale 
the change in intent write downs in were a result of ongoing comprehensive reviews of our portfolios resulting in write downs of individually identified investments

sales generated billion of net realized gains in primarily due to million and million of gains on sales of equity and us and foreign government fixed income securities  respectively 
sales of equity securities were primarily in connection with a change in strategy that uses a more passive portfolio management approach with a greater emphasis on asset allocation decisions 
net realized losses from sales in were due to net realized losses on equity securities of million comprised of gross losses of billion and gross gains of million 
the gross losses in primarily resulted from the execution of tax planning strategies primarily within our equity portfolios that are effectively carried on a lower of cost or fair value basis to realize capital loss carryback benefits

losses from the risk management programs primarily occurred in the equity hedge program and related to a decrease in volatility and increase in the equity index 
a changing interest rate environment will drive changes in our portfolio duration targets at a tactical level 
a duration target and range is established with an economic view of liabilities relative to a long term investment portfolio view 
tactical duration management is accomplished through both cash market transactions  sales and new purchases and derivative activities that generate realized gains and losses 
as a component of our approach to managing portfolio duration  realized gains and losses on certain derivative instruments are most appropriately considered in conjunction with the unrealized gains and losses on the fixed income portfolio 
this approach mitigates the impacts of general interest rate changes to our overall financial condition 
at december   our securities with embedded options totaled billion  a decrease in fair value of million from december   resulting in realized capital gains on valuation of million  net sales activity of million  and unrealized net capital gains reported in other comprehensive income oci of million for the host securities

the change in fair value of embedded options is bifurcated from the host securities  separately valued and reported in realized capital gains and losses  while the change in the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost of the host securities is reported in oci 
total amortized cost exceeded total fair value by million at december  valuation gains and losses are converted into cash for securities with embedded options upon our election to sell these securities 
in the event the economic value of the options is not realized  we will recover the par value if held to maturity unless the issuer of the note defaults

exchange traded options on treasury futures are utilized to supplement the protection provided by swaption contracts without increasing the counterparty risk associated with otc contracts 
the loss primarily relates to the impact of the decline in volatility on the option on treasury futures and swaption contracts 
if interest rates do not increase above the strike rate  the maximum loss on swaptions and options on treasury futures is limited to the amount of the premium paid 
the program is anticipated to be revised throughout the year as capital market conditions change

the first is where quotes continue to be received from independent third party valuation service providers and all significant inputs are market observable  however there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset when compared to normal market activity such that the degree of market observability has declined to a point where categorization as a level measurement is considered appropriate 
among the indicators we consider in determining whether a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for a specific asset has occurred include the following level of new issuances in the primary market  trading volume in the secondary market  level of credit spreads over historical levels  bid ask spread  and price consensus among market participants and sources 
the second situation where we have classified securities in level is where specific inputs to our fair value estimation models which are considered significant are not market observable 
this has occurred in two principal categories 
the first is for broker quotes 
the second is our ars backed by student loans for which a principal assumption  the anticipated date liquidity will return to this market  is not market observable 
during  certain alt a rmbs  prime rmbs and abs credit card and auto were transferred into level from level as a result of increased liquidity in these markets see level rollforward in note of the consolidated financial statements 
this was evidenced by increased trading volume and the narrowing of bid ask spreads for our specific holdings 
additionally  privately placed corporate fixed income securities that are valued using internal pricing models were transferred into level from level as a result of enhancements to the valuation methodology  refinements to model inputs and corroboration of our internal credit rating process by comparison to available external ratings 
we have also implemented price validation procedures such as back testing of actual sales  which corroborates the various model inputs to market observable data 
when transferring these securities into level  we do not change the source of fair value estimates or modify the estimates received from independent third party valuation service providers or the internal valuation approach 
accordingly  for securities included within this group  there was no change in fair value resulting in a realized or unrealized gain or loss 
during  certain cmbs were transferred into level from level as a result of decreased liquidity in these markets 
this was evidenced by decreased trading volume and the widening of bid ask spreads for these holdings 
transfers into level during also included situations where a fair value quote is not provided by our independent third party valuation service provider and as a result the price is stale or has been replaced with a broker quote resulting in the security being classified as level transfers out of level during also included situations where a broker quote was used in the prior period and a fair value quote is now available from our independent third party valuation service provider 
a quote utilizing the new pricing source is not available as of the prior period  and any gains or losses related to the change in valuation source for individual securities are not significant 
market risk market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity  interest  credit spreads  commodity  or currency exchange rates and prices 
adverse changes to these rates and prices may occur due to changes in the liquidity of a market or market segment  insolvency or financial distress of key market makers or participants or changes in market perceptions of credit worthiness and or risk tolerance 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates  credit spreads and equity prices  although we also have a smaller exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
the active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations 
we may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios  changing the character of investments purchased in the future and using derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased 
for a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
overview in formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds  we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and stable profits and long term capital growth 
accordingly  our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each business 
investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks  including accountability and controls over risk management activities 
subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors 
these investment policies specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity  surplus  product profile and regulatory requirements of the subsidiary 
executive oversight of investment activities is conducted primarily through subsidiaries boards of directors and investment committees 
for allstate financial  its asset liability management alm policies further define the overall framework for managing market and investment risks 
alm focuses on strategies to enhance yields  mitigate market risks and optimize capital to improve profitability and returns for allstate financial 
allstate financial alm activities follow asset liability policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors 
these alm policies specify limits  ranges and or targets for investments that best meet allstate financial s business objectives in light of its product liabilities 
we manage our exposure to market risk through the use of asset allocation  duration  simulation  and as appropriate  through the use of stress tests 
we have asset allocation limits that place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class 
we have duration limits on the property liability and allstate financial investment portfolios and  as appropriate  on individual components of these portfolios 
these duration limits place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken 
comprehensive day to day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies 
for allstate financial  this day to day management is integrated with and informed by the activities of the alm organization 
this integration is intended to result in a prudent  methodical and effective adjudication of market risk and return  conditioned by the unique demands and dynamics of allstate financial s product liabilities and supported by the continuous application of advanced risk technology and analytics 
although we apply a similar overall philosophy to market risk  the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the property liability and allstate financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters 
interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates relative to the interest rate characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities 
this risk arises from many of our primary activities  as we invest substantial funds in interest sensitive assets and issue interest sensitive liabilities 
interest rate risk includes risks related to changes in us treasury yields and other key risk free reference yields 
we manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities 
one of the measures used to quantify this exposure is duration 
duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates 
for example  if interest rates increase basis points  the fair value of an asset with a duration of is expected to decrease in value by approximately 
at december   the difference between our asset and liability duration was  compared to a gap at december  a negative duration gap indicates that the fair value of our liabilities is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our assets 
the property liability segment generally maintains a positive duration gap between its assets and liabilities due to the relatively short duration of auto and homeowners claims  which are its primary liabilities 
the allstate financial segment may have a positive or negative duration gap  as the duration of its assets and liabilities vary with its product mix and investing activity 
at december   property liability had a positive duration gap while allstate financial had a negative duration gap 
in the management of investments supporting the property liability business  we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework 
this approach is designed to ensure our financial strength and stability for paying claims  while maximizing economic value and surplus growth 
for the allstate financial business  we seek to invest premiums  contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims  benefits and expenses  and that will earn stable spreads across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios 
to achieve this objective and limit interest rate risk for allstate financial  we adhere to a philosophy of managing the duration of assets and related liabilities within predetermined tolerance levels 
this philosophy is executed using duration targets for fixed income investments in addition to interest rate swaps  futures  forwards  caps  floors and swaptions to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from mismatches between existing assets and liabilities  and financial futures and other derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk of anticipated purchases and sales of investments and product sales to customers 
we pledge and receive collateral on certain types of derivative contracts 
for futures and option contracts traded on exchanges  we have pledged securities and cash as margin deposits totaling million as of december  for otc derivative transactions including interest rate swaps  foreign currency swaps  interest rate caps  interest rate floors and cds  master netting agreements are used 
these agreements allow us to net payments due for transactions covered by the agreements and  when applicable  we are required to post collateral 
as of december   we held cash of million pledged by counterparties as collateral for otc instruments  we pledged securities of million as collateral to counterparties 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on otc derivative collateral requirements by assuming a hypothetical reduction in our s p insurance financial strength ratings from aa to a and a basis point decline in interest rates 
the analysis indicated that we would have to post an estimated million in additional collateral with attributable to allstate financial 
the selection of these hypothetical scenarios should not be construed as our prediction of future events  but only as an illustration of the estimated potential effect of such events 
we also actively manage our counterparty credit risk exposure by monitoring the level of collateral posted by our counterparties with respect to our receivable positions 
to calculate the duration gap between assets and liabilities  we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net present value using a risk free market interest rate adjusted for credit quality  sector attributes  liquidity and other specific risks 
duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative interest rates and determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value 
the cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of our derivative financial instruments  all other financial instruments  and certain other items including unearned premiums  property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves  annuity liabilities and other interest sensitive liabilities 
the projections include assumptions based upon historical market experience and our experience that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment  lapse  leverage and or option features of instruments  where applicable 
the preceding assumptions relate primarily to mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  municipal housing bonds  callable municipal and corporate obligations  and fixed rate single and flexible premium deferred annuities 
additionally  the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of property liability policies 
based upon the information and assumptions used in the duration calculation  and interest rates in effect at december   we estimate that a basis point immediate  parallel increase in interest rates rate shock would decrease the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by million  compared to million at december  reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of a program that uses options on treasury futures to manage the property liability interest rate risk exposures relative to duration targets  as well as a program that uses interest rate swaptions to manage the risk of a large rate increase 
in calculating the impact of a basis point increase on the value of the derivatives  we have assumed interest rate volatility remains constant 
based on the option on treasury futures and swaption contracts in place at december   we would recognize realized capital gains totaling million in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel interest rate increase and million in realized capital losses in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel interest rate decrease on these derivatives 
the selection of a basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
there are billion of assets supporting life insurance products such as traditional and interest sensitive life that are not financial instruments 
these assets and the associated liabilities have not been included in the above estimate 
the billion of assets excluded from the calculation has increased from the billion reported at december  as fixed income valuations have improved as a result of significant tightening of credit spreads 
based on assumptions described above  in the event of a basis point immediate increase in interest rates  the assets supporting life insurance products would decrease in value by million  compared to a decrease of million at december  to the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations  duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted 
additionally  our calculations assume that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates the term structure of interest rates will remain constant over time 
as a result  these calculations may not fully capture the effect of non parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and or large changes in interest rates 
credit spread risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in credit spreads spreads 
this risk arises from many of our primary activities  as we invest substantial funds in spread sensitive fixed income assets 
we manage the spread risk in our assets 
one of the measures used to quantify this exposure is spread duration 
spread duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets to changes in spreads 
for example  if spreads increase basis points  the fair value of an asset exhibiting a spread duration of is expected to decrease in value by approximately 
spread duration is calculated similarly to interest rate duration 
at december   the spread duration of property liability assets was  compared to at december  and the spread duration of allstate financial assets was  compared to at december  based upon the information and assumptions we use in this spread duration calculation  and spreads in effect at december   we estimate that a basis point immediate  parallel increase in spreads across all asset classes  industry sectors and credit ratings spread shock would decrease the net fair value of the assets by billion  compared to billion at december  reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of our risk mitigation actions that use cds to manage spread risk 
based on contracts in place at december   we would recognize realized capital gains totaling million in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel spread increase and million in realized capital losses in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel spread decrease 
the selection of a basis point immediate parallel change in spreads should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
equity price risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the equity markets 
at december   we held billion in common stocks and exchange traded funds etfs and billion in other securities with equity risk including primarily convertible securities  limited partnership interests  non redeemable preferred securities and equity linked notes  compared to billion and billion  respectively  at december  and of these totals  respectively  represented assets of the property liability operations at december   compared to and  respectively  at december  additionally  we had  contracts in long standard poor s composite price index s p puts at december  with a fair value of million 
at december   our portfolio of common stocks and other securities with equity risk had a cash market portfolio beta of  compared to a beta of at december  beta represents a widely used methodology to describe  quantitatively  an investment s market risk characteristics relative to an index such as the s p based on the beta analysis  we estimate that if the s p increases or decreases by  the fair value of our equity investments will increase or decrease by  respectively 
based upon the information and assumptions we used to calculate beta at december   including the effect of the s p puts  we estimate that an immediate decrease in the s p of would decrease the net fair value of our equity investments identified above by million  compared to million at december   and an immediate increase in the s p of would increase the net fair value by million compared to million at december  in calculating the impact of a s p index perturbation on the value of the puts  we have assumed index volatility remains constant 
based on the s p index put options in place at december   we would recognize losses totaling million in the event of a increase in the s p index and million in gains in the event of a decrease 
the selection of a immediate decrease or increase in the s p should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
the beta of our common stocks and other securities with equity risk was determined using barra s predictive beta 
this beta is based on a company s fundamental data 
the illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if the future composition of the portfolio hence its beta and correlation relationships differ from the historical relationships 
at december  and  we had separate accounts assets related to variable annuity and variable life contracts with account values totaling billion and billion  respectively 
equity risk exists for contract charges based on separate account balances and guarantees for death and or income benefits provided by our variable products 
in  we disposed of substantially all of the variable annuity business through reinsurance agreements with prudential and therefore mitigated this aspect of our risk 
equity risk for our variable life business relates to contract charges and policyholder benefits 
total variable life contract charges for and were million and million  respectively 
separate account liabilities related to variable life contracts were million and million in december  and  respectively 
at december  and we had billion and billion  respectively  in equity indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with interest crediting rates based on the performance of the s p we hedge the risk associated with these liabilities using equity indexed options and futures  interest rate swaps  and eurodollar futures  maintaining risk within specified value at risk limits 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments  including real estate funds and private equity funds  and our canadian operations 
we also have certain funding agreement programs and fixed income securities that are denominated in foreign currencies  however  derivatives are used to hedge the foreign currency risk of these funding agreements and approximately of the fixed income securities 
at both december  and  we had million in funding agreements denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   we had billion in foreign currency denominated equity investments  million net investment in our foreign subsidiaries  and million in unhedged non dollar pay fixed income securities 
these amounts were million  million  and million  respectively  at december  of the foreign currency exposure is in the property liability business 
based upon the information and assumptions used at december   we estimate that a immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed to would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by million  compared with an estimated million decrease at december  the selection of a immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
our currency exposure is diversified across currencies at december   compared to currencies at december  our largest individual foreign currency exposures at december  were to the canadian dollar and the euro 
the largest individual foreign currency exposures at december  were to the canadian dollar and the euro 
our primary regional exposure is to western europe  with at december   compared to at december  the modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates 
even though we believe it is very unlikely that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by  we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse market scenarios 
our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee 
commodity price risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the prices of commodities 
this risk arises from commodity linked investments  such as the dow jones aig commodity index and goldman sachs commodity index which is a broad based  oil dominated index 
at december  and  we had no exposure to the indices 
pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans  which cover most full time and certain part time employees and employee agents 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements 
the pension and other postretirement plans may be amended or terminated at any time 
any revisions could result in significant changes to our obligations and our obligation to fund the plans 
we report unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost in the consolidated statements of financial position as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
it represents differences between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement plans that have not yet been recognized as a component of net periodic cost 
the measurement of the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost can vary based upon the fluctuations in the fair value of the plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for the plans as discussed below 
the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost at december  was billion  an increase of million from billion at december  the increase was the result of a decrease in the discount rate used to value liabilities partially offset by increases in the value of plan assets 
as of december  and  each of our qualified pension plans had projected benefit obligations that exceeded plan assets 
the market related value component of expected returns recognizes plan losses and gains on equity securities over a five year period  which we believe is consistent with the long term nature of pension obligations 
as a result  the effect of changes in fair value of equity securities on our net periodic pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur 
net periodic pension cost in is estimated to be million based on current assumptions  including settlement charges 
this represents an increase compared to expense due to the effect of equity losses during the fiscal year and the decrease in discount rates experienced at the end of net periodic pension cost decreased in due to the increase in discount rate for each pension plan  which resulted in lower amortization of net actuarial loss 
net periodic pension cost decreased in principally due to lower service cost  higher expected returns on plan assets  and lower amortization of net actuarial loss due to higher plan asset values 
in and  net pension cost included non cash settlement charges primarily resulting from lump sum distributions made to agents 
additional settlement charges occurred during  and also related to the supplemental retirement income plan as a result of lump sum payments made from the plan 
settlement charges are likely to continue for some period in the future as we settle our remaining agent pension obligations by making lump sum distributions to agents 
amounts recorded for pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income are significantly affected by fluctuations in the returns on plan assets and the amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses 
plan assets sustained net losses in prior periods primarily due to declines in equity and credit markets 
these asset losses  combined with all other unrecognized actuarial gains and losses  resulted in amortization of net actuarial loss and additional net periodic pension cost of million in and million in we anticipate that the unrealized loss for our pension plans will exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets in and into the foreseeable future  resulting in additional amortization and net periodic pension cost 
amounts recorded for net periodic pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income are also significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the weighted average discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the weighted average discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date 
we develop the assumed weighted average discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from bonds available in the barclays corporate bond universe having ratings of at least aa by s p or at least aa by moody s on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements 
significant changes in discount rates  such as those caused by changes in the credit spreads  yield curve  the mix of bonds available in the market  the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments  may result in volatility in pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income 
holding other assumptions constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in the weighted average discount rate would result in an increase of million in net periodic pension cost and a million increase in the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost liability of our pension plans recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income as of december   compared to an increase of million in net periodic pension cost and a million increase in the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost liability as of december  a hypothetical increase of basis points in the weighted average discount rate would decrease net periodic pension cost by million and would decrease the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost liability of our pension plans recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income by million as of december   compared to a decrease in net periodic pension cost of million and a million decrease in the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost liability of our pension plans recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  this non symmetrical range results from the non linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations  and changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets 
while this rate reflects long term assumptions and is consistent with long term historical returns  sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost 
differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are a component of unrecognized gains or losses  which may be amortized as a component of net actuarial gains and losses and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as a result  the effect of changes in fair value on our pension cost may be experienced in results of operations in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur 
holding other assumptions constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of million in pension cost at december   compared to million at december  a hypothetical increase of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of million at december   compared to million at december  we target funding levels that do not restrict the payment of plan benefits in our domestic plans and were within our targeted range as of december  in  we contributed million to our pension plans  including million of contributions as discussed below 
we expect to contribute million for the plan year to maintain the plans funded status 
this estimate could change significantly following either a dramatic improvement or decline in investment markets 
in  we became aware of allegations that some employees responsible for trading equity securities in certain portfolios of two aic defined benefit pension plans and certain portfolios of aic and an aic subsidiary may have timed the execution of certain trades in order to enhance their individual performance under incentive compensation plans  without regard to whether such timing adversely impacted the actual investment performance of the portfolios 
we retained outside counsel  who in turn engaged an independent economic consulting firm to conduct a review and assist us in understanding the facts surrounding  and the potential implications of  the alleged timing of these trades for the period from june to may the consulting firm reported that it was unable to determine from our records the precise amounts by which portfolio performance might have been adversely impacted during that period 
accordingly  the economic consultant applied economic modeling techniques and assumptions reasonably designed to estimate the potential adverse impact on the pension plans and the company accounts  taking into account  among other things  the distinctions between the pension plans and the company portfolios 
based on their work  the economic consultants estimated that the performance of the pension plans portfolios could have been adversely impacted by approximately million including interest and that the performance of the company portfolios could have been adversely impacted by approximately million including interest in the aggregate over the six year period under review 
we believe that our financial statements and those for the pension plans properly reflected the portfolios actual investment performance results during the entire period that was reviewed 
in december  based on the economic consultant s modeled estimates  we paid an aggregate of million into the two defined benefit pension plans 
these payments had no material impact on our reported earnings or shareholders equity  but reduced our assets  operating cash flows  and unfunded pension liability to the plans 
at december   our total assets  operating cash flows and shareholders equity were billion  billion and billion  respectively 
at all times during this period  the plans were adequately funded pursuant to applicable regulatory and actuarial requirements 
as a result of these additional funds in the plans  our future contributions to the plans  based on actuarial analysis  may be reduced 
using the economic consultant s calculation of the potential adverse impact on the portfolios  we currently estimate that the additional compensation paid to all the employees working in the affected group was approximately million over the six year period as a result of these activities 
in late  we retained an independent investment firm to conduct portfolio management and trading activity for the specific portfolios impacted by these activities 
we have reported this matter to the us department of labor and the us securities and exchange commission and have advised both agencies that we will respond to any questions they might have 
deferred taxes we evaluate whether a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets is required each reporting period 
a valuation allowance is established if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is needed  all available evidence is considered 
this includes the potential for capital and ordinary loss carryback  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  tax planning strategies that we may employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences 
with respect to our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset on capital losses that have been realized but have not yet been recognized for tax purposes  we utilize prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that optimize the ability to carry back capital losses as well as the ability to offset future capital losses with unrealized capital gains that could be recognized for tax purposes 
we have remaining capital loss carryback capacity of billion and million from and  respectively 
with respect to our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset on unrealized capital losses on fixed income and equity securities  our tax planning strategies first consider the availability of unrealized capital gains to offset future capital losses and then we rely on our assertion that we have the intent and ability to hold certain securities with unrealized losses to recovery 
as a result  the unrealized losses on these securities would not be expected to materialize and no valuation allowance on the associated deferred tax asset is needed 
the total deferred tax valuation allowance was million at december   million at both september  and june   million at march  and million at december  the following table shows how changes in the valuation allowance were recorded in the consolidated financial statements in in millions adjustments recorded in the three months ended march  adjustments recorded in the nine months ended december  impact of adoption of new otti accounting guidance as of april  balance as of december  decrease to income decrease increase to other comprehensive income increase in retained income increase in other comprehensive income increase to income increase to other comprehensive income balance as of december  property liability allstate financial total income tax expense for the year ended december  includes expense of million attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance relating to the deferred tax asset on capital losses recorded in the first quarter of of the million  million was attributable to allstate financial and was primarily related to other than temporary impairment write downs that were not deductible for tax purposes as of march  million was attributable to property liability and was primarily related to unrealized losses on equity securities as of december  for which we were unable to demonstrate a tax planning offset with future capital gains as of march  this valuation allowance was released in connection with the adoption of new otti accounting guidance on april   however  the release was recorded as an increase to retained income and therefore did not reverse the amount recorded in income tax expense 
the release of the valuation allowance is related to the reclassification of previously recorded other than temporary impairment write downs from retained income to unrealized capital losses 
capital resources and liquidity highlights shareholders equity as of december  was billion  an increase of from billion as of december  deployable cash and investments at the parent holding company level totaled billion at december  compared to billion at december  as of december   aic statutory surplus is approximately billion compared to billion at december  these amounts include alic s statutory surplus of approximately billion at december   compared to billion at december  at december   we held of our total consolidated cash and investment portfolio  or billion  in cash and liquid investments that are saleable within one quarter without significant additional net realized capital losses

the decrease to shareholders equity resulting from the increase in the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost in was the result of unfavorable investment returns partially offset by the effects of higher discount rates 
the change to the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost had an impact on shareholders equity of million unfavorable for pension  and million favorable for other post employment benefits opeb

alic  aic and the corporation are party to the amended and restated intercompany liquidity agreement liquidity agreement which allows for short term advances of funds to be made between parties for liquidity and other general corporate purposes 
the liquidity agreement does not establish a commitment to advance funds on the part of any party 
alic and aic each serve as a lender and borrower and the corporation serves only as a lender 
aic also has a capital support agreement with alic 
under the capital support agreement  aic is committed to provide capital to alic to maintain an adequate capital level 
the maximum amount of potential funding under each of these agreements is billion 
on june   the corporation advanced million to aic under the liquidity agreement to facilitate investing activity 
this amount was repaid on december  to provide funds for the corporation to repay the million of senior notes that matured on december  in addition to the liquidity agreement  the corporation also has an intercompany loan agreement with certain of its subsidiaries  which include  but are not limited to  aic and alic 
the amount of intercompany loans available to the corporation s subsidiaries is at the discretion of the corporation 
the maximum amount of loans the corporation will have outstanding to all its eligible subsidiaries at any given point in time is limited to billion 
the corporation may use commercial paper borrowings  bank lines of credit and repurchase agreements to fund intercompany borrowings 
allstate s domestic property liability and life insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the applicable state of domicile 
statutory surplus is a measure that is often used as a basis for determining dividend paying capacity  operating leverage and premium growth capacity  and it is also reviewed by rating agencies in determining their ratings 
as of december   aic s statutory surplus is approximately billion compared to billion at december  these amounts include alic s statutory surplus of approximately billion at december   compared to billion at december  the ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property casualty insurance industry and serves as an indicator of a company s premium growth capacity 
ratios in excess of to are typically considered outside the usual range by insurance regulators and rating agencies 
aic s premium to surplus ratio was x on december  compared to x in the prior year 
state laws specify regulatory actions if an insurer s risk based capital rbc  a measure of an insurer s solvency  falls below certain levels 
the naic has a standard formula for annually assessing rbc 
the formula for calculating rbc for property liability companies takes into account asset and credit risks but places more emphasis on underwriting factors for reserving and pricing 
the formula for calculating rbc for life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance  business  asset and interest rate risks 
at december   the rbc for each of our domestic insurance companies was within the range that we target 
the naic has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the insurance regulatory information system to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by insurance regulatory authorities 
the naic analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios  each with defined usual ranges 
generally  regulators will begin to monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios 
if an insurance company has insufficient capital  regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue 
the ratios of our domestic insurance companies are within these ranges 
liquidity sources and uses our potential sources of funds principally include activities shown in the following table 
property liability allstate financial corporate and other receipt of insurance premiums x x allstate financial contractholder fund deposits x reinsurance recoveries x x receipts of principal  interest and dividends on investments x x x sales of investments x x x funds from investment repurchase agreements  securities lending  commercial paper and line of credit agreements x x x intercompany loans x x x capital contributions from parent x x dividends from subsidiaries x x tax refunds settlements x x x funds from periodic issuance of additional securities x funds from the settlement of our benefit plans x our potential uses of funds principally include activities shown in the following table

liquidity is managed at both the entity and enterprise level across the company  and is assessed on both base and stressed level liquidity needs 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet these needs  with billion of cash and liquid investments saleable within days without generating significant additional capital losses of the total cash and investment portfolio 
we expect billion of investment portfolio cashflows from maturities  calls  and interest receipts over the next months 
additionally  we have existing intercompany agreements in place that facilitate liquidity management across the company to enhance flexibility 
parent company capital capacity at the parent holding company level  we have deployable cash and investments totaling billion as of december  these assets include liquid cash and investments that are generally saleable within one quarter totaling billion 
the substantial earnings capacity of the operating subsidiaries is the primary source of capital generation for the corporation 
in  aic will have the capacity to pay dividends currently estimated at billion without prior regulatory approval 
we do not anticipate that alic will pay dividends to aic in in addition  we have access to billion of funds from either commercial paper issuance or an unsecured revolving credit facility 
this provides funds for the parent company s relatively low fixed charges 
in march  the corporation and aic completed a previously approved capital contribution of million of cash to alic 
this capital contribution was funded by a dividend of million paid to the corporation in cash by kennett capital holdings  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation 
in december  aic made a capital contribution to alic in the form of non cash assets in the amount of million 
pursuant to authority granted by its board in december  aic may make approximately million in additional funds available to alic on or before march  by making capital contributions in cash or securities or by purchasing surplus notes or other securities from alic 
the corporation has access to additional borrowing to support liquidity as follows a commercial paper facility with a borrowing limit of billion to cover short term cash needs 
as of december   there were no balances outstanding and therefore the remaining borrowing capacity was billion  however  the outstanding balance can fluctuate daily 
our primary credit facility is available for short term liquidity requirements and backs our commercial paper facility 
our billion unsecured revolving credit facility has an initial term of five years expiring in with two optional one year extensions that can be exercised at the end of any of the remaining anniversary years of the facility upon approval of existing or replacement lenders providing more than two thirds of the commitments to lend 
the program is fully subscribed among lenders with the largest commitment being million 
the commitments of the lenders are several and no lender is responsible for any other lender s commitment if such lender fails to make a loan under the facility 
this facility contains an increase provision that would allow up to an additional million of borrowing provided the increased portion could be fully syndicated at a later date among existing or new lenders 
this facility has a financial covenant requiring that we not exceed a debt to capital resources ratio as defined in the agreement 
this ratio at december  was 
although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement  the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior  unsecured  nonguaranteed long term debt 
there were no borrowings under the credit facility during the total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility 
a universal shelf registration statement was filed with the securities and exchange commission on may  we can use our current shelf registration to issue an unspecified amount of debt securities  common stock including million shares of treasury stock as of december   preferred stock  depositary shares  warrants  stock purchase contracts  stock purchase units and securities of trust subsidiaries 
the specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements 
liquidity exposure contractholder funds as of december  were billion 
the following table summarizes contractholder funds by their contractual withdrawal provisions at december  in millions percent to total not subject to discretionary withdrawal subject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments specified surrender charges market value adjustments subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustments total contractholder funds includes billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than of the account balance 
billion of the contracts with market value adjusted surrenders have a day period at the end of their initial and subsequent interest rate guarantee periods which are typically or years during which there is no surrender charge or market value adjustment 
of these contracts have a minimum interest crediting rate guarantee of or higher 
includes billion of contractholder funds on variable annuities reinsured to prudential effective june  while we are able to quantify remaining scheduled maturities for our institutional products anticipating retail product surrenders is less precise 
retail life and annuity products may be surrendered by customers for a variety of reasons 
reasons unique to individual customers include a current or unexpected need for cash or a change in life insurance coverage needs 
other key factors that may impact the likelihood of customer surrender include the level of the contract surrender charge  the length of time the contract has been in force  distribution channel  market interest rates  equity market conditions and potential tax implications 
in addition  the propensity for retail life insurance policies to lapse is lower than it is for fixed annuities because of the need for the insured to be re underwritten upon policy replacement 
surrenders and partial withdrawals for our retail annuities decreased in compared to the annualized surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred annuities  interest sensitive life insurance and allstate bank products  based on the beginning of year contractholder funds  was and in and  respectively 
the annualized surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred fixed annuities was in compared to in allstate financial strives to promptly pay customers who request cash surrenders  however  statutory regulations generally provide up to six months in most states to fulfill surrender requests 
our institutional products are primarily funding agreements backing medium term notes 
as of december   total institutional products outstanding were billion 
the following table presents the remaining scheduled maturities for our institutional products outstanding as of december  in millions our asset liability management practices limit the differences between the cash flows generated by our investment portfolio and the expected cash flow requirements of our life insurance  annuity and institutional product obligations 
certain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity 
those events and circumstances include  for example  a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses  a downgrade in our long term debt rating of a  a and a from moody s  s p and am best  respectively to non investment grade status of below baa bbb bb  a downgrade in aic s financial strength rating from aa  aa and a from moody s  s p and am best  respectively to below baa bbb a  or a downgrade in alic s financial strength ratings from a  aa and a from moody s  s p and am best  respectively to below a aa a 
the rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities  therefore  a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities 
the following table summarizes consolidated cash flow activities by business segment 
in millions property liability allstate financial corporate and other consolidated net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in consolidated cash business unit cash flows reflect the elimination of intersegment dividends  contributions and borrowings 
property liability higher cash provided by operating activities for property liability in compared to was primarily due to income tax refunds in compared to tax payments in and lower claim payments 
lower cash provided by operating activities for property liability in compared to was primarily due to higher claim payments resulting from catastrophe losses and lower investment income 
cash used in investing activities in compared to cash provided by investing activities in was primarily due to increased net purchases of fixed income and equity securities  partially offset by net change in short term investments 
cash flows provided by investing activities increased in compared to was primarily due to decreased purchases of fixed income securities  partially offset by increases in equity securities purchases  lower sales of fixed income securities  and net change in short term investments 
lower cash flows used in financing activities in compared to was primarily due to lower tax benefits of share based compensation arrangements in cash used in financing activities in compared to cash provided by in was primarily due to decreased tax benefits of share based compensation arrangements in there were no dividends paid by aic to its parent  the corporation  in in and  cash flows were impacted by dividends paid by aic to its parent  the corporation  totaling billion and billion  respectively

there were no capital contributions to alic in allstate financial paid dividends to aic and the corporation totaling million in allstate financial operating cash flows for allstate financial in were consistent with as higher income tax refunds and lower expenses were offset by lower net investment income 
the increase in income tax refunds received in was related to the carryback of ordinary losses to prior tax years 
lower operating cash flows for allstate financial in compared to were primarily related to a decrease in investment income and lower premiums  partially offset by income tax refunds in compared to higher cash flows provided by investing activities in compared to were primarily due to reductions of short term investments to fund reductions in contractholder fund liabilities 
cash flows provided by investing activities increased in compared to  primarily due to decreased purchases of fixed income securities and mortgage loans  partially offset by lower investment collections and net change in short term investments 
higher cash flows used in financing activities in compared to were primarily due to the absence of issuances of institutional products in compared to billion in and lower deposits on fixed annuities  partially offset by lower maturities and retirements of institutional products 
higher cash flows used in financing activities in compared to were primarily due to higher maturities and retirements of institutional products  partially offset by higher contractholder fund deposits 
for quantification of the changes in contractholder funds  see the allstate financial segment section of the md a 
in  allstate financial cash flows were impacted by a return of capital by american heritage life investment corporation to the corporation totaling million 
there were no dividends paid by allstate financial in in  cash flows were impacted by dividends paid by allstate financial totaling million 
allstate financial cash flows were also impacted by capital contributions paid in cash by aic to alic totaling million in cash flows in exclude capital contributions to alic comprising the transfer to alic from aic of non cash assets totaling million and the transfer of a million surplus note to kennett capital inc from alic in exchange for a note receivable with a principal sum equal to that of the surplus note  which was originally issued to alic by a subsidiary of alic 
in  allstate financial cash flows were also impacted by funds paid by aic to alic totaling billion 
the billion includes capital contributions paid in cash totaling million and the issuance of two surplus notes  each with a principal sum of million  to aic in exchange for cash totaling million 
allstate financial cash flows in exclude capital contributions to alic comprising the transfer to alic from aic of non cash assets totaling million and the transfer of a million surplus note to kennett capital inc from alic in exchange for a note receivable with a principal sum equal to that of the surplus note  which was originally issued to alic by a subsidiary of alic 
one of the surplus notes issued to aic in was subsequently canceled and forgiven by aic resulting in the recognition of a capital contribution equal to the outstanding principal balance of the surplus note of million 
there were no capital contributions to alic in corporate and other fluctuations in the corporate and other operating cash flows were primarily due to the timing of intercompany settlements 
investing activities primarily relate to investments in the portfolios of kennett capital holdings  llc 
financing cash flows of the corporate and other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in short term debt  repayment of debt  proceeds from the issuance of debt  dividends to shareholders of the allstate corporation and share repurchases  therefore  financing cash flows are affected when we increase or decrease the level of these activities 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations as of december  and the payments due by period are shown in the following table 
in millions total less than year years years over years liabilities for collateral and repurchase agreements contractholder funds reserve for life contingent contract benefits long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense other liabilities and accrued expenses net unrecognized tax benefits total contractual cash obligations liabilities for collateral and repurchase agreements are typically fully secured with cash 
we manage our short term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business  including utilizing potential sources of liquidity as disclosed previously 
contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest sensitive life  fixed annuities  including immediate annuities without life contingencies  bank deposits and institutional products 
the reserve for life contingent contract benefits relates primarily to traditional life and immediate annuities with life contingencies 
these amounts reflect the present value of estimated cash payments to be made to contractholders and policyholders 
certain of these contracts  such as immediate annuities without life contingencies and institutional products  involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable 
these amounts relate to i policies or contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so and ii contracts where the timing of a portion or all of the payments has been determined by the contract 
other contracts  such as interest sensitive life  fixed deferred annuities  traditional life and immediate annuities with life contingencies and voluntary accident and health insurance  involve payment obligations where a portion or all of the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain 
for these contracts and bank deposits  we are not currently making payments and will not make payments until i the occurrence of an insurable event such as death or illness or ii the occurrence of a payment triggering event such as the surrender or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract  which is outside of our control 
we have estimated the timing of payments related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality  morbidity  expenses  customer lapse and withdrawal activity  estimated additional deposits for interest sensitive life contracts  and renewal premium for life policies  which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments 
such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality  retirement  and other appropriate factors  but are undiscounted with respect to interest 
as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liabilities of billion for contractholder funds and billion for reserve for life contingent contract benefits as included in the consolidated statements of financial position as of december  the liability amount in the consolidated statements of financial position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above 
our payment obligations relating to long term debt  capital lease obligations  operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations and pension and opeb contributions are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long term liquidity management program 
amount differs from the balance presented on the consolidated statements of financial position as of december  because the long term debt amount above includes interest 
the pension plans obligations in the next months represent our planned contributions  and the remaining years contributions are projected based on the average remaining service period using the current underfunded status of the plans 
the opeb plans obligations are estimated based on the expected benefits to be paid 
these liabilities are discounted with respect to interest  and as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount of billion included in other liabilities and accrued expenses on the consolidated statements of financial position 
reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense is an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been ibnr as of the balance sheet date 
we have estimated the timing of these payments based on our historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
however  the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts shown above  especially for ibnr claims 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts which are our best estimates 
the reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense includes loss reserves related to asbestos and environmental claims as of december   of billion and million  respectively 
other liabilities primarily include accrued expenses and certain benefit obligations and claim payments and other checks outstanding 
certain of these long term liabilities are discounted with respect to interest  as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount of billion 
balance sheet liabilities not included in the table above include unearned and advance premiums of billion and deferred tax liabilities of billion netted in the net deferred tax asset of billion 
these items were excluded as they do not meet the definition of a contractual liability as we are not contractually obligated to pay these amounts to third parties 
rather  they represent an accounting mechanism that allows us to present our financial statements on an accrual basis 
in addition  other liabilities of million were not included in the table above because they did not represent a contractual obligation or the amount and timing of their eventual payment was sufficiently uncertain 
net unrecognized tax benefits represent our potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe it is reasonably possible that the liability balance will be reduced by million within the next twelve months upon the resolution of an outstanding issue resulting from the internal revenue service examination 
the resolution of this obligation may be for an amount different than what we have accrued 
our contractual commitments as of december  and the periods in which the commitments expire are shown in the following table 
in millions total less than year years years over years other commitments conditional other commitments unconditional total commitments contractual commitments represent investment commitments such as private placements  limited partnership interests and mortgage loans 
we have agreements in place for services we conduct  generally at cost  between subsidiaries relating to insurance  reinsurance  loans and capitalization 
all material intercompany transactions have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation 
intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required

allstate s board of directors and audit committee provide errm oversight by reviewing enterprise principles  guidelines and limits for allstate s significant risks and by monitoring strategies and actions management has taken to control these risks 
managers  risk professionals and chief risk officers in the various business units design and execute individual risk return strategies that align with our overall enterprise standards 
these include managing exposure to hurricanes and other severe weather events  managing impacts to invested assets and liabilities related to changes in risk free interest rates  credit spreads  equity markets and defaults  optimizing liquidity levels in light of changing market  economic and business conditions  and implementing practices to effectively identify  monitor and control operational and strategic risks

regulation and legal proceedings we are subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions  all of which have an effect on specific aspects of our business 
for a detailed discussion of the legal and regulatory actions in which we are involved  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
pending accounting standards there are several pending accounting standards that we have not implemented either because the standard has not been finalized or the implementation date has not yet occurred 
for a discussion of these pending standards  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation 
for this reason  we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them
