item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our selected financial data and our financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report 
the following discussion may contain forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs and involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed under the headings risk factors and forward looking statements 
overview we develop  manufacture and sell healthcare products for use in clinical and home settings 
our mission is to create and deliver innovative healthcare solutions  developed in ethical collaboration with medical professionals  which enhance the quality of life for patients and improve outcomes for our customers and our shareholders 
we manage and operate our business through the following three segments medical devices includes the development  manufacture and sale of endomechanical instruments  soft tissue repair products  energy devices  oximetry and monitoring products  airway and ventilation products  products used in vascular therapies and other medical products 
pharmaceuticals includes the development  manufacture and distribution of specialty pharmaceuticals  active pharmaceutical ingredients  contrast products and radiopharmaceuticals 
medical supplies includes the development  manufacture and sale of nursing care products  medical surgical products  sharpsafety products and original equipment manufacturer oem products 
effective june   covidien became the parent company owning the former healthcare businesses of tyco international ltd 
as part of a plan to separate tyco international into three independent companies  tyco international transferred the equity interests of the entities that held all of the assets and liabilities of its healthcare businesses to covidien and  on june   distributed all of its shares of covidien and tyco electronics to tyco international shareholders the separation 
our financial statements have been prepared in us dollars  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
recent development in march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act was enacted in the united states  which includes provisions that would impose a excise tax on the sale of certain of our medical device and supply products in the united states starting in in addition  the new legislation includes a billion fee on the branded pharmaceutical industry over nine years starting in and a billion annual fee on branded pharmaceuticals thereafter 
the amount of branded pharmaceutical fee payable by each company is based upon market share 
since our branded pharmaceutical sales currently represent a small portion of the total market  we do not expect this annual assessment to have a significant impact on covidien 
the medical devices tax  however  may have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we are still evaluating the potential impact that this tax may have on our overall business 
this new legislation increases our cost of doing business 
if this cost is not offset by increased demand for our products  other cost reductions or price increases  we could experience lower margins and profitability and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition to the excise tax and annual fee described above  the new legislation contains numerous other provisions  many of which pertain to health insurance plans  which could impact our financial results in future periods

this charge relates to an alternative minimally invasive device for the treatment of varicose veins and venous reflux that vnus is developing  which has not yet received regulatory approval 
as of the date of acquisition  this technology was not considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use 
design  testing  clinical trials and regulatory submission are required in order to bring the project to completion 
if the device receives regulatory approval  we anticipate that it will occur in fiscal and be released to the market shortly thereafter 
management determined the valuation of the in process research and development using  among other factors  appraisals 
the value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method and was discounted at a rate  which was considered commensurate with the project s risks and stage of development 
future residual cash flows that could be generated from the project were determined based upon management s estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the project and technology involved 
these projected cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account management s estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the project to completion 
we cannot assure that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will prove to be accurate or that the form k

purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital requirements 
the table above does not include million of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and million of associated accrued interest and penalties 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows  we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
information regarding expected audit settlements and estimated change in our unrecognized tax benefits is provided under income taxes 
this table does not include other liabilities of million  primarily consisting of liabilities pertaining to pension and postretirement benefits  environmental liabilities  insurable liabilities and deferred compensation  because the timing of their future cash outflow is uncertain 
however  the minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be million in fiscal in addition  we expect to make contributions of million to our postretirement benefit plans in fiscal at september   we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of million 
legal proceedings we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including patent infringement claims  product liability matters  environmental matters  employment disputes  disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes 
we believe that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time 
although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings  based upon our experience  current information and applicable law  we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a future period 
item legal proceedings and note to our financial statements provide further information regarding legal proceedings 
income taxes our income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities 
open periods for examination include certain periods during which we were a subsidiary of tyco international 
the resolution of the matters arising during periods during which we were a tyco international subsidiary is subject to the conditions set forth in the tax sharing agreement discussed in note to our financial statements 
tyco international has the right to administer  control and settle all us income tax audits for periods prior to the separation 
we have significant potential tax liabilities related to these periods and have included our best estimate of the amounts which relate to our operations within our current or non current income taxes payable 
our income tax returns for years after our separation from tyco are also periodically under examination 
we have potential liabilities related to these income tax returns and have included our best estimate of potential liabilities for these years within our non current taxes payable 
with respect to these potential income tax liabilities from all of these years  we believe that the amounts recorded in our financial statements as current or non current taxes payable are adequate 
in accordance with the tax sharing agreement  we share certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of tyco international for periods prior to the separation  with covidien assuming  tyco international and tyco electronics of the total amount 
we are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for billion of contingent tax liabilities that are recorded on the balance sheet at september   billion of which relates to periods prior to the separation and which is shared with tyco international and tyco electronics pursuant to the tax sharing agreement 
the actual amounts that we may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under the tax sharing agreement could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters  some of which may not be resolved for several years 
form k 
table of contents in addition  pursuant to the terms of the tax sharing agreement  we have recorded a current and long term receivable from tyco international and tyco electronics of million and million  respectively  which are classified as due from former parent and affiliate on our balance sheet at september  these receivables primarily reflect of our contingent tax liabilities that are subject to the tax sharing agreement 
if tyco international and tyco electronics default on their obligations to us under the tax sharing agreement  however  we would be liable for the entire amount of such liabilities 
the irs has concluded its field examination of certain of tyco international s us federal income tax returns for the years through and proposed tax adjustments  several of which also affect our income tax returns for years after tyco international has appealed certain of the tax adjustments proposed by the irs and covidien believes that some of these adjustments are likely to be resolved within the next months 
with respect to other adjustments  tyco international has indicated that settlement is unlikely 
in the event that tyco international is unable to resolve these issues in the irs administrative process  tyco international will likely contest certain adjustments related to disallowed deductions through litigation 
while we believe that the amounts recorded as non current taxes payable or guaranteed contingent tax liabilities related to these adjustments are adequate  the timing and outcome of such litigation is highly uncertain and could have a significant effect on our financial statements 
in addition  the irs continues to audit certain of tyco international s us federal income tax returns for the years through tyco international and the irs have entered into settlements related to certain outstanding tax matters arising in this audit cycle  which otherwise remains open and subject to examination and resolution of other matters 
in connection with the settlements of the through and through audit cycles  we estimate that we will be required to make a payment of approximately million to the irs  which is included in current income taxes payable on the balance sheet 
pursuant to the tax sharing agreement  we will receive payments totaling approximately million from tyco international and tyco electronics  which is classified as current and included in due from former parent and affiliate 
we will also be required to reimburse tyco international and tyco electronics million for our portion of their settlements 
the resolution of issues arising from the through and through audit cycles  as well as other settlements or statute of limitations expirations  could result in a significant change in our unrecognized tax benefits 
we estimate that within the next months  our gross uncertain tax positions  exclusive of interest could decrease by as much as million  as a result of such settlements or expirations 
these estimates of changes to unrecognized tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes 
finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings  and  as a result  it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible change related to our unrecognized tax benefits 
guarantees pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and tax sharing agreement  we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and tyco electronics 
these guarantee arrangements and indemnifications primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities  we assumed and are responsible for of these liabilities 
regarding the guarantees  if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs related to any such liability  we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation 
these arrangements were valued upon our separation from tyco international using appraisals and a liability related to these guarantees was recorded on our balance sheet  the offset of which was reflected as a reduction in shareholders equity 
each reporting period  we evaluate the potential loss which we believe is probable as a result of our commitments under the agreements 
to the extent such potential loss exceeds the amount recorded on our balance sheet  an adjustment will be required to increase the recorded liability to the amount of such potential form k 
table of contents loss 
this guarantee is not amortized because no predictable pattern of performance currently exists 
as a result  the liability generally will be reduced upon release from our obligations under the agreements  which may not occur for some years 
in addition  as payments are made to indemnified parties  such payments are recorded as reductions to the liability and the impact of such payments is considered in the periodic evaluation of the sufficiency of the liability 
a liability of million and million relating to these guarantees was included on our balance sheet at september  and september   respectively 
in disposing of assets or businesses  we often provide representations  warranties and indemnities to cover various risks  including unknown damage to the assets  environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate  liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities  and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition 
except as discussed below  we generally do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions 
however  we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in connection with the sale of our specialty chemicals business  we provided the purchaser with an indemnification for various risks  including environmental  health  safety  tax and other matters  some of which have an indefinite term 
however  the most significant portion of this indemnification relates to environmental  health and safety matters  which has a term of years 
a liability of million relating to this indemnification was included on our balance sheet as of september  the value of the environmental  health and safety guarantee was measured based on the probability weighted present value of the costs expected to be incurred to address environmental claims proposed under the indemnity 
the maximum future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification provided to the purchaser is million 
in addition  we were required to pay million into an escrow account as collateral  which is included in other assets on the balance sheet 
we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities  which are discussed in note to our financial statements 
in addition  we are liable for product performance  however in the opinion of management  such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties 
management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred from us to the buyer  which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site  based on contract terms or legal requirements in non us jurisdictions 
we sell products both direct to end user customers and through distributors who resell the products to end user customers 
rebates are provided to certain distributors that sell to end user customers at prices determined in accordance with a contract between us and the end user customer 
provisions for rebates  as well as sales discounts and returns  are accounted for as reduction of sales when revenue is recognized and are included in the reserve for returns  rebates and sales allowances within accounts receivable trade on our balance sheets 
we estimate rebates based on sales terms  historical experience and trend analyses 
in estimating rebates  we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor s rebate claim  distributor specific trend form k 
table of contents analyses  contractual commitments  including stated rebate rates  and other relevant information 
we adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience  and record such adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment 
historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future 
rebates charged against gross sales in fiscal  and amounted to billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
intangible assets intangible assets include intellectual property consisting primarily of patents  trademarks  unpatented technology and customer lists 
we record intangible assets at cost and amortize certain of such assets using the straight line method over ten to forty years 
we evaluate the remaining useful life of intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
intangible assets that are not subject to amortization  which are comprised primarily of certain trademarks  are tested for impairment in the same manner as goodwill 
we review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment in the same manner as property  plant and equipment discussed above 
goodwill in performing goodwill assessments  management relies on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses  there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated 
we calculate our goodwill valuations using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit 
this approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates  discount factors and income tax rates 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
we test goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year for impairment  or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
we utilize a two step approach 
the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units through internal analyses and valuation  using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  including intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
contingencies we are involved  both as a plaintiff and a defendant  in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business  including  without limitation  patent infringement  product liability and environmental matters  as further discussed in note to our financial statements 
accruals recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings  self insurance and other claims are based on judgment  the probability of losses and  where applicable  the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates 
when a range is established but a best estimate cannot be made  we record the minimum loss contingency amount 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are reevaluated each accounting period  as additional information is available 
when we are initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  we record the minimum amount of loss  which could be zero 
as information becomes known  additional loss provision is recorded when either a best estimate can be made or the minimum loss amount is increased 
when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected  our best estimate is changed to a lower amount 
we record form k 
table of contents receivables from third party insurers when we have determined that existing insurance policies will provide reimbursement 
in making this determination  we consider applicable deductibles  policy limits and the historical payment experience of the insurance carriers 
pension and postretirement benefits our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations 
two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience 
actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions 
the discount rate is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans 
for our us plans  the discount rate is based on the market rate for a broad population of moody s aa rated corporate bonds over million 
for our non us plans  the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and region specific government and corporate bond interest rates 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately million 
we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans  as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets  in determining the expected long term return on plan assets 
a basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately million 
guarantees pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and tax sharing agreement  we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and tyco electronics 
each reporting period  we evaluate the potential loss which we believe is probable as a result of our commitments under the agreements 
to the extent such potential loss exceeds the amount recorded on our balance sheet  an adjustment will be required to increase the recorded liability to the amount of such potential loss 
this guarantee has not been amortized into income to date because no predictable pattern of performance currently exists 
as a result  the liability generally will be reduced upon release from our obligations under the agreements  which may not occur for some years  or  as payments are made to indemnified parties 
the impact of such payments is considered in the periodic evaluation of the sufficiency of the liability 
in addition  we have  from time to time  provided guarantees and indemnifications to unrelated parties 
these guarantees have not been material to our financial statements 
the most significant of these guarantees relates to an indemnification  which we provided to the purchaser of our specialty chemicals business  primarily related to environmental  health  safety  tax and other matters 
as of september   we have a liability of million on our balance sheet related to this indemnification  however  we could be required to make payments of up to million 
we periodically reassess our exposure and potential loss under these arrangements  and  in the event that an increase in the fair value of the guarantee occurs  a charge to income will be required 
income taxes in determining income for financial statement purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and international pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses 
form k 
table of contents we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination 
the tax benefit of any tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon resolution of the uncertainty 
to the extent a full benefit is not realized on the uncertain tax position  an income tax liability is established 
we adjust these liabilities as a result of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
a significant portion of our potential tax liabilities are recorded in non current income taxes payable on our balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes  however  which would have a material effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we have recorded significant valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions that we intend to maintain until it appears to be more likely than not that some or all of those deferred tax assets will be realized 
our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets of billion and billion at september  and september   respectively  relate principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets  primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 
included in the valuation allowance at both september  and september  is billion which represents a full valuation allowance against certain non us net operating losses recorded in fiscal as a result of the receipt of a favorable tax ruling 
it is highly unlikely that any of this net operating loss will be utilized 
we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions to realize the tax benefits related to the net deferred tax assets in our balance sheets 
however  any reduction in future taxable income  including any future restructuring activities  may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
our income tax expense recorded in the future may also be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances 
forward looking statements we have made forward looking statements in this report that are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
in order to manage the volatility to our more significant market risks  we enter into derivative financial instruments such as forward currency exchange contracts 
foreign currency risk arises from our investments in affiliates and subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 
such risk is also a result of transactions with customers in countries outside the united states 
we use foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts on accounts and notes receivable  accounts payable  intercompany loan balances and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies 
based on a sensitivity analysis of our existing contracts outstanding at september   a appreciation of the us dollar from the september  market rates would increase the unrealized value of contracts on our balance sheet by million  while a depreciation of the us dollar would decrease the unrealized value of contracts on our balance sheet by million 
however  such gains or losses on these contracts would ultimately be offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions
