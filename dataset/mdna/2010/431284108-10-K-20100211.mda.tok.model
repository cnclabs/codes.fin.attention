item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
to meet in part our long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
our debt consists of secured and unsecured long term financings  unsecured debt securities  loans and credit facilities  which typically bear interest at fixed rates although some loans bear interest at variable rates 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars  swaps  caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we generally do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes
