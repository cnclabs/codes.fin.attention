significant accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company and lakeland conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and predominant practices within the banking industry 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  lakeland  lakeland investment corp  and lakeland nj investment corp 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions also affect reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates implicit in these financial statements are as follows 
the principal estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the allowance for loan and lease losses  the valuation of the company s securities portfolio  the realizability of the 
table of contents company s deferred tax asset and the analysis of goodwill impairment 
the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses includes  among other factors  an analysis of historical loss rates  by category  applied to current loan and lease totals 
however  actual losses may be higher or lower than historical trends  which vary 
actual losses on specified problem loans and leases  which also are provided for in the evaluation  may vary from estimated loss percentages  which are established based upon a limited number of potential loss classifications 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense 
loan principal considered to be uncollectible by management is charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb losses on existing loans and leases that may become uncollectible based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan and lease portfolio 
the evaluation takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and size of the loan and lease portfolio  overall portfolio quality  specific problem loans and leases  and current economic conditions which may affect the borrowers ability to pay 
the evaluation also details historical losses by loan and lease category  the resulting loss rates for which are projected at current loan and lease total amounts 
loss estimates for specified problem loans and leases are also detailed 
all of the factors considered in the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses may be subject to change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan and lease losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
lakeland accounts for impaired loans and leases in accordance with us gaap 
accordingly  impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
regardless of the measurement method  a creditor must measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral when the creditor determines that foreclosure is probable 
fair values of financial instruments are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates  credit ratings and yield curves 
fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments or an estimate of fair value by using a range of fair value estimates in the market place as a result of the illiquid market specific to the type of security 
in the second and third quarters of  lakeland reclassified certain leases as held for sale and recorded them at their estimated fair value based on sale price indications from potential buyers and on prior lease sales adjusted for differences in collateral and other characteristics 
when the fair value of a security is below its amortized cost  and depending on the length of time the condition exists and the extent the fair value is below amortized cost  additional analysis is performed to determine whether an other than temporary impairment condition exists 
available for sale and held to maturity securities are analyzed quarterly for possible other than temporary impairment 
the analysis considers i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iii the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
often  the information available to conduct these assessments is limited and rapidly changing  making estimates of fair value subject to judgment 
if actual information or conditions are different than estimated  the extent of the impairment of the security may be different than previously estimated  which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
deferred tax expense is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the principal types of 
table of contents differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and tax return purposes are allowance for loan and lease losses  core deposit intangible  deferred loan costs  deferred compensation  valuation reserves on leases held for sale and state net operating loss carryforwards 
the company evaluates tax positions that may be uncertain using a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements 
additional information regarding the company s uncertain tax positions is set forth in note to the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements contained herein 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate a potential for impairment at the reporting unit level 
impairment testing requires that the fair value of each reporting unit be compared to the carrying value of its net assets  including goodwill the step one test 
the company has determined that it has one reporting unit  community banking 
the company determined that the income approach and the market approach were most appropriate in determining if a step two test for impairment was necessary 
the income approach uses a dividend discount analysis 
this approach calculates cash flows to a potential acquirer based on the anticipated financial results assuming a change of control transaction 
this change of control assumes that an acquirer will achieve an expected base level of earnings  achieve integration cost savings and incur certain transaction costs such as legal and financial adviser fees  contract cancellations  severance and employment obligations  and other transaction costs 
the analysis then calculates the present value of all excess cash flows generated by the company above the minimum tangible capital ratio plus the present value of a terminal sale value 
the market approach is used to calculate the fair value of a company by calculating median price multiples in recent actual acquisitions of companies of similar size and then applying these multiples to the company 
this technique uses historical data to create a current pricing level and is thus a trailing indicator 
results of the selected transaction approach need to be understood in this context  especially in periods of rapid price change and market uncertainty 
also included in the analysis was a premium to market approach which calculates the change of control price a market participant would pay for a company by adding a change of control premium to the trading value of a company 
the analysis also considered a change of control premium to peer market price approach which substitutes trading values from a group of peer companies for the trading values of the parent company 
based on this analysis  there was no indication that the company s goodwill was impaired as of december   and a step two test was not required 
financial overview the year ended december  represented a year of continued growth for the company

net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets 
the company s net interest income is determined by i the volume of interest earning assets that it holds and the yields that it earns on those assets  and ii the volume of interest bearing liabilities that it has assumed and the rates that it pays on those liabilities 
net interest income increases when the company can use noninterest bearing deposits to fund or support interest earning assets 
net interest income for on a tax equivalent basis was million  representing an increase of million  or  from the million earned in the increase in net interest income primarily resulted from an basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income for on a tax equivalent basis was million  representing an increase of million  or  from the million earned in the increase in net interest income primarily resulted from an basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  a million increase in average interest earning assets and a more favorable mix of earning assets

b includes interest bearing cash accounts 
c net interest income divided by interest earning assets 
interest income on a tax equivalent basis decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in interest income was due primarily to a basis point decrease in the average yield earned on interest earning assets 
this decrease reflects the declining interest rate environment along with a lower percentage of earning assets being deployed in loans and leases  as the size of the lease portfolio continues to decrease 
loans and leases as a percent of interest earning assets declined from in to in investments  including securities and federal funds sold  increased from of

average interest bearing liabilities increased million  but the cost of those liabilities decreased from in to in the decrease in yield was due to the low rate environment and a change in deposit mix 
average interest bearing deposits increased from billion in to billion in  an increase of million  or 
average borrowings decreased from million in to million in  due to increased liquidity as a result of several factors  including increased deposits and the receipt of million in proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock to the us department of the treasury in the first quarter of total interest expense decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million  or 
average interest bearing liabilities increased million  but the cost of those liabilities decreased from in to in the decrease in liability yields reflects a decrease in short term interest rates  as the federal reserve bank lowered the federal funds target rate from at year end to a range of to at the end of lakeland lowered its deposit rates to reflect this lower interest rate environment 
net interest margin net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis by average interest earning assets 
the company s net interest margin was  and for  and  respectively 
the decline in net interest margin from to was a result of the increase in non performing loans in combined with the impact of the decline in interest rates on interest earning assets 
the net interest margins for and each would have been had all of the non accrual loans performed as agreed upon 
the increase in the net interest margin from to reflects the decrease in short term interest rates and a shift in earning assets from the investment portfolio to the loan and lease portfolio 
provision for loan and lease losses in determining the provision for loan and lease losses  management considers national and local economic conditions  trends in the portfolio including orientation to specific loan types or industries  experience  ability and depth of lending management in relation to the complexity of the portfolio  adequacy and adherence to policies  procedures and practices  levels and trends in delinquencies  impaired loans and leases and net charge offs and the results of independent third party loan and lease review 
the provision for loan and lease losses increased to million in from million in this was primarily a result of management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the impact current economic conditions have had on our lease portfolio 
in the second quarter of  because of continued economic challenges  accelerated deterioration of collateral values due to the supply of transportation and construction vehicles exceeding demand and the resulting effect on delinquencies  the company increased the reserve percentages on its leases to the highest risk level on its evaluation matrix 
due to continued overcapacity of the collateral impacting resale values  the company continued to adjust the collateral value of the 
table of contents underlying assets  which had the effect of increasing charge offs 
the increase in the calculated reserves  the increase in charge offs recorded in the second quarter and the company s decision to sell pools of leases that represented an increased risk to the company  contributed to the company s provision for loan and lease losses in of million

the charge offs included million for the two leasing originators that informed lakeland that they could no longer perform under contractual recourse provisions 
the charge offs resulted from a continued deterioration in economic conditions and in the underlying collateral value of the leases 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases outstanding was in the ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding excluding leases was in the provision for loan and lease losses at million in increased from million in due to management s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio and reflected higher levels of nonperforming loans and leases and charge offs in compared to the provision included million for the company s leasing portfolio 
net charge offs increased from million in to million in  including million in net charge offs of leases

loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other related conditions 
the following table sets forth certain categories of loans as of december   in terms of contractual maturity date within one year after one but within five years after five years total in thousands types of loans commercial real estate construction total amount of such loans with predetermined rates floating or adjustable rates total 
table of contents risk elements commercial loans and leases are placed on a non accrual status with all accrued interest and unpaid interest reversed if a because of the deterioration in the financial position of the borrower they are maintained on a cash basis which means payments are applied when and as received rather than on a regularly scheduled basis  b payment in full of interest or principal is not expected  or c principal and interest have been in default for a period of days or more unless the obligation is both well secured and in process of collection 
residential mortgage loans are placed on non accrual status at the time when foreclosure proceedings are commenced  except where there exists sufficient collateral to cover the defaulted principal and interest payments  and management s knowledge of the specific circumstances warrant continued accrual 
consumer loans are generally charged off when principal and interest payments are four months in arrears unless the obligations are well secured and in the process of collection 
interest thereafter on such charged off consumer loans is taken into income when received only after full recovery of principal 
the following schedule sets forth certain information regarding the company s non accrual and past due loans and leases and other real estate owned and other repossessed assets as of december  for each of the last five years at december  in thousands non performing assets non accrual loans and leases other real estate and other repossessed assets total non performing assets non performing assets as a percent of total assets past due loans and leases loans restructured and still accruing represents loans and leases as to which payments of interest or principal are contractually past due days or more  but which are currently accruing income at the contractually stated rates 
a determination is made to continue accruing income on such loans and leases only if collection of the debt is proceeding in due course and collection efforts are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt or in its restoration to a current status 
non accrual loans and leases increased to million on december  from million at december  non accrual loans include million  million  million and million in commercial  leasing  home equity and consumer  and residential mortgages  respectively 
the change in non accrual loans and leases from million on december  to million on december  included an increase in commercial loan non accruals of million  which was partially offset by a decline in leasing non accruals of million 
the increase in commercial loan non accruals resulted from a deterioration in the economy impacting commercial real estate loans 
commercial loan non accruals included loan relationships between  and million totaling million  and loan relationships exceeding million totaling million 
the largest of the commercial loan non accrual loans was million 
the leasing non accruals declined because of the sales of lease pools 
all non accrual loans and leases are in various stages of litigation  foreclosure  or workout 
other real estate and other repossessed assets decreased from million on december  to million on december   which includes million of leasing repossessed assets sold 

table of contents at december   the company had million in loans that were restructured and still accruing 
restructured loans are those loans that the company has granted concessions to the borrower in payment terms either in rate or in term as a result of the financial condition of the borrower 
the increase in restructured loans compared to prior years results from a deterioration in the economy impacting commercial real estate values and increases in the unemployment rate 
for  the gross interest income that would have been recorded  had the loans and leases classified at year end as non accrual been performing in conformance with their original terms  is approximately million 
the amount of interest income actually recorded on those loans and leases for was  the resultant loss of million for exceeds prior year losses of  for and  for loans and leases specifically evaluated are deemed impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan or lease agreements 
loans and leases which are well secured and in process of collection generally will not be classified as impaired 
a loan or lease is not impaired during the process of collection of payment if the company expects to collect all amounts due  including interest accrued at the contractual interest rate 
all commercial loans in excess of  identified as impaired are separately evaluated by management 
the company aggregates commercial loans less than  consumer loans and residential mortgages for evaluation purposes 
the company s policy concerning commercial non accrual loans and leases states that  except for loans and leases which are considered to be fully collectible by virtue of collateral held and in the process of collection  loans and leases are placed on a non accrual status when payments are days delinquent or more 
it is possible for a loan or lease to be on non accrual status and not be classified as impaired if the balance of such loan or lease is relatively small and  therefore  has not been specifically reviewed for impairment 
loans and leases  or portions thereof  are charged off in the period that the loss is identified 
until such time  an allowance for loan or lease loss is maintained for estimated losses 
with regard to interest income recognition for payments received on impaired loans and leases  as well as all non accrual loans and leases  the company follows regulatory guidelines  which apply any payments to principal as long as there is doubt as to the collectibility of the balance 
as of december   based on the above criteria  the company had impaired loans and leases totaling million consisting primarily of non accrual and restructured loans and leases 
the valuation allowance of these loans and leases is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral 
based upon such evaluation  million has been allocated to the allowance for loan and lease losses for impairment 
at december   the company also had million in loans and leases that were rated substandard that were not classified as non performing or impaired 
there were no additional loans or leases at december   other than those designated non performing  impaired or substandard  where the company was aware of any credit conditions of any borrowers that would indicate a strong possibility of the borrowers not complying with the present terms and conditions of repayment and which may result in such loans or leases being included as non accrual  past due or renegotiated at a future date 

table of contents the following table sets forth for each of the five years ended december   the historical relationships among the amount of loans and leases outstanding  the allowance for loan and lease losses  the provision for loan and lease losses  the amount of loans and leases charged off and the amount of loan and lease recoveries december  in thousands balance of the allowance at the beginning of the year loans and leases charged off commercial leases charge downs of leases held for sale home equity and consumer real estate mortgage total loans and leases charged off recoveries commercial leases home equity and consumer real estate mortgage total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan and lease losses charged to operations ending balance ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases outstanding including charge down of leases held for sale excluding charge down of leases held for sale ratio of allowance at end of year as a percentage of year end total loans and leases amount recorded upon reclassification from held for investment to held for sale the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to loans outstanding reflects management s evaluation of the underlying credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements is the responsibility of management 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a quarterly basis 
methodology employed for assessing the adequacy of the allowance consists of the following criteria the establishment of reserve amounts for all specifically identified classified loans and leases that have been designated as requiring attention by the company or the company s external loan review consultants 
the establishment of reserves for pools of homogeneous types of loans and leases not subject to specific review  including commercial loans under  family residential mortgages  and consumer loans 
the establishment of reserve amounts for the non classified loans and leases in each portfolio based upon the historical average loss experience for these portfolios and management s evaluation of key factors 

table of contents consideration is given to the results of ongoing credit quality monitoring processes  the adequacy and expertise of the company s lending staff  underwriting policies  loss histories  delinquency trends  and the cyclical nature of economic and business conditions 
since many of the company s loans depend on the sufficiency of collateral as a secondary source of repayment  any adverse trend in the real estate markets could affect underlying values available to protect the company from loss 
in the second and fourth quarters of  the company disclosed that it had two leasing originators that indicated that they could no longer meet all of their obligations under contractual recourse provisions 
lakeland assessed the adequacy of the allowance for its lease portfolio based on the borrower s payment history  financial strength of the borrower determined through financial information provided or credit scoring criteria  value of the underlying assets and in the case of recourse transactions  the financial strength of the originator servicer 
if the servicer is able to continue servicer advances for delinquent leases  lakeland assesses a reserve on the lease based on credit scores and delinquency status 
in the case of the two originators who could no longer perform under their contractual recourse obligations  once the lease became over days past due  the lease was charged down to its net realizable value using a recognized valuation method to the extent available and placed on non accrual 
from that point forward  reserves were adjusted as necessary based on delinquency status and where the lease was in the collection process 
the collateral underlying the aforementioned lease pools was predominately transportation and construction use vehicles 
because of economic conditions  including fuel costs in and the general economic downturn further depressing these industries into  leasing delinquencies and declines in collateral value resulted in increased charge offs and provisions for lease losses into as a result  management made a decision in the second quarter of to reduce the risk in its portfolio by selling those two lease pools as well as other lease pools with characteristics that did not fit into the company s core banking strategy 
in the second quarter of  a million provision for loan and lease losses was recorded which included a million provision for lease losses 
this provision was determined by management s evaluation of the identified risk in the lease portfolio as well as the mark to market adjustment of million on the lease pools sold during the second quarter and the million mark to market adjustment on lease pools initially held for sale on june  in the third quarter of  management continued to sell the lease pools that were marked to market in the second quarter

the company s management believes that its current level of liquidity is sufficient to meet its current and anticipated operational needs including current loan commitments  deposit maturities and other obligations 
this constitutes a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ materially from anticipated results due to a variety of factors  including uncertainties relating to general economic conditions  unanticipated decreases in deposits  changes in or failure to comply with governmental regulations  and uncertainties relating to the analysis of the company s assessment of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities and the extent to which market factors indicate that a financial institution such as lakeland should match such assets and liabilities

interest rate risk closely related to the concept of liquidity is the concept of interest rate sensitivity ie  the extent to which assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as a financial institution  the company s potential interest rate volatility is a primary component of its market risk 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
based upon the company s nature of operations  the company is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the company does not own any trading assets and does not have any off balance sheet hedging transactions in place  such as interest rate swaps and caps 
the company s net income is largely dependent on net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the extent that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis that interest earning assets 
for example  when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets  an increase in market rates could adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  when interest earning assets reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  an increase in market rates could increase net interest income 
the company s board of directors has adopted an asset liability policy designed to stabilize net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements 
this policy outlines guidelines and ratios dealing with  among others  liquidity  volatile liability dependence  investment portfolio composition  loan portfolio composition  loan to deposit ratio and gap analysis ratio 
key quantitative measurements include the percentage change of net interest income in various interest rate scenarios net interest income at risk and changes in the market value of equity in various rate environments net portfolio value at risk 
the company s performance as compared to the asset liability policy is monitored by its board of directors 
in addition  to effectively administer the asset liability policy and to monitor exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  the company maintains an asset liability committee  consisting of the chief executive officer  chief operating officer  chief financial officer  chief lending officer  chief retail officer  chief credit officer  certain other senior officers and certain directors 
this committee meets quarterly to review the company s financial results and to develop strategies to implement the asset liability policy and to respond to market conditions 

table of contents the company monitors and controls interest rate risk through a variety of techniques  including use of an interest rate risk management model 
with the interest rate risk management model  the company projects future net interest income  and then estimates the effect of various changes in interest rates and balance sheet growth rates on that projected net interest income 
the company also uses the interest rate risk management model to calculate the change in net portfolio value over a range of interest rate change scenarios 
interest rate sensitivity modeling is done at a specific point in time and involves a variety of significant estimates and assumptions 
interest rate sensitivity modeling requires  among other things  estimates of how much and when yields and costs on individual categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will respond to general changes in market rates  future cash flows and discount rates 
net interest income simulation considers the relative sensitivities of the balance sheet including the effects of interest rate caps on adjustable rate mortgages and the relatively stable aspects of core deposits 
as such  net interest income simulation is designed to address the probability of interest rate changes and the behavioral response of the balance sheet to those changes 
market value of portfolio equity represents the fair value of the net present value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items 
changes in estimates and assumptions made for interest rate sensitivity modeling could have a significant impact on projected results and conclusions 
these assumptions could include prepayment rates  sensitivity of non maturity deposits and other similar assumptions 
therefore  if our assumptions should change  this technique may not accurately reflect the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income or net portfolio value 
the starting point or base case for the following table is an estimate of the following year s net interest income assuming that both interest rates and the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities remain at year end levels 
the net interest income estimated for the base case is million 
the information provided for net interest income assumes that changes in interest rates change gradually in equal increments rate ramp over the twelve month period

the information provided for the net portfolio value assumes fluctuations or rate shocks for changes in interest rates as shown in the table below 
rate shocks assume that current interest rates change immediately

there are also other scenarios run that the alco examines that vary depending on the economic environment 
these scenarios include a yield curve flattening scenario and scenarios that show more dramatic

the committee uses the appropriate scenarios  depending on the economic environment  in its interest rate management decisions 
capital resources stockholders equity increased from million on december  to million on december  the increase in stockholders equity from december  to december  was primarily due to the issuance of million in preferred stock and a warrant to the u 
s treasury department 
for more information  please see note in notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
offsetting the impact of the million in preferred stock was a net loss of million  and the payment of dividends of million 
book value per common share total common stockholders equity divided by the number of shares outstanding decreased from on december  to on december  as a result of the net loss and the payment of dividends 
as a result of the net loss in  the company reduced its dividend from per share quarterly to per share quarterly in the third quarter of book value per common share was on december  the fdic s risk based capital policy statement imposes a minimum capital standard on insured banks 
the minimum ratio of risk based capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet items  such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of the total capital is to be comprised of common stock equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill tier i capital 
the remainder tier ii capital may consist of mandatory convertible debt securities  qualifying subordinated debt  other preferred stock and a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the federal reserve board has adopted a similar risk based capital guideline for the company which is computed on a consolidated basis 
in addition  the bank regulators have adopted minimum leverage ratio guidelines tier i capital to average quarterly assets  less goodwill for financial institutions 
these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of for financial institutions that meet certain specified criteria  including that they have the highest regulatory rating 
all other holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of plus an additional cushion of at least to basis points

this pronouncement was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september   for most entities 
on the effective date  all non sec accounting and reporting standards were superseded 
the company adopted the presentation for the 
table of contents quarterly period ended september   as required  and adoption did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements taken as a whole 
in june  the fasb issued guidance addressing whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  need to be included in the calculation of earnings per share eps 
the guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  with prior period eps data adjusted retrospectively to conform to its provisions  and did not have a material effect on the company s eps 
in december  the fasb issued guidance on an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan 
this guidance requires disclosure of the fair value of each major category of plan assets for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans as of the annual reporting date 
this guidance became effective for fiscal years ending after december  adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
on april   the fasb issued the following guidance that was intended to provide additional guidance and enhance disclosures regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities 
this included guidelines for making fair value measurements more consistent with the existing accounting principles when the volume and level of activity of an asset or liability have decreased significantly 
enhanced consistency in financial disclosure by requiring fair value disclosures for financial instruments to be reported in interim financial statements 
previously  fair values for financial instruments were only disclosed annually 
additional guidance designed to create greater clarity and consistency in accounting for and presenting impairment losses on securities 
this guidance is intended to bring greater consistency to the timing of impairment recognition  and provide greater clarity to investors about the credit and noncredit components of impaired debt securities that are not expected to be sold 
the above guidance was effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  the company applied this guidance in the second quarter and expanded the disclosures as required 
on april   the securities and exchange commission issued guidance on how to evaluate equity securities for other than temporary impairment and when a write down of the carrying value is required 
there was no material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
the company recorded other than temporary impairments on its equity securities of  in on may   the fasb issued accounting guidance which established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of subsequent events  which are events occurring after the balance sheet date but before the date the financial statements are issued or available to be issued 
in particular  the guidance requires entities to recognize in the financial statements the effect of all subsequent events that provide additional evidence of conditions that existed at the balance sheet date  including the estimates inherent in the financial preparation process 
entities may not recognize the impact of subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the balance sheet date but arose after that date 
this guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  the company applied the guidance which did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements taken as a whole 
on june   the fasb issued accounting guidance changing the accounting principles and disclosure requirements related to securitizations and special purpose entities 
this guidance eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets and changes how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
this guidance also expands existing disclosure requirements to include 
table of contents more information about transfers of financial assets  including securitization transactions  and where companies have continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets 
this guidance will be effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier application is prohibited 
the recognition and measurement provisions regarding transfers of financial assets shall be applied to transfers that occur on or after the effective date 
management does not expect that application of this guidance will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued accounting guidance which provides amendments for fair value measurements of liabilities 
it provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more techniques 
this guidance also clarifies that when estimating a fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability 
this accounting guidance is effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance or the fourth quarter of for the company 
the company applied this guidance in fourth quarter  and adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements taken as a whole 
in january  the fasb issued accounting guidance to enhance fair value measurement disclosures by requiring the reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reason for the transfers 
furthermore  activity in level fair value measurements should separately provide information about purchases  sales  issues and settlements rather than providing that information as one net number 
these new disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   with the exception of the enhanced level disclosures  which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  management does not expect that application of this guidance will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation the impact of inflation  as it affects banks  differs substantially from the impact on non financial institutions 
banks have assets which are primarily monetary in nature and which tend to move with inflation 
this is especially true for banks with a high percentage of rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
a bank can further reduce the impact of inflation with proper management of its rate sensitivity gap 
this gap represents the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
lakeland attempts to structure its assets and liabilities and manages its gap to protect against substantial changes in interest rate scenarios  in order to minimize the potential effects of inflation
