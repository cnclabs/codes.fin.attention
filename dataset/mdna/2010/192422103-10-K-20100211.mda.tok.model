executive overview cognex corporation is a leading worldwide provider of machine vision products that capture and analyze visual information in order to automate tasks  primarily in manufacturing processes  where vision is required 
our modular vision systems division mvsd specializes in machine vision systems that are used to automate the manufacturing of discrete items  while our surface inspection systems division sisd specializes in machine vision systems that are used to inspect the surfaces of materials processed in a continuous fashion 
in addition to product revenue derived from the sale of machine vision systems  the company also generates revenue by providing maintenance and support  training  consulting  and installation services to its customers 
our customers can be classified into three primary markets discrete factory automation  semiconductor and electronics capital equipment  and surface inspection 
discrete factory automation customers purchase cognex vision products and incorporate them into their manufacturing processes 
virtually every manufacturer can achieve better quality and manufacturing efficiency by using machine vision  and therefore  this segment includes a broad base of customers across a variety of industries  including automotive  consumer electronics  food and beverage  health and beauty  medical devices  packaging  and pharmaceutical 
sales to 
table of contents discrete factory automation customers represented approximately of total revenue in  compared to of total revenue in semiconductor and electronics capital equipment manufacturers purchase cognex vision products and integrate them into the automation equipment that they manufacture and then sell to their customers to either make semiconductor chips or assemble printed circuit boards 
demand from these capital equipment manufacturers has historically been highly cyclical  with periods of investment followed by downturn 
this market has been in a prolonged downturn since early sales to semiconductor and electronics capital equipment manufacturers represented approximately of total revenue in  compared to of total revenue in surface inspection customers are manufacturers of materials processed in a continuous fashion  such as metals  paper  non wovens  plastics  and glass 
these customers need sophisticated machine vision to detect  classify  and analyze defects on the surfaces of those materials as they are being processed at high speeds 
surface inspection sales represented approximately of total revenue in  compared to of total revenue in revenue for the year ended december  totaled  representing a decrease from the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to lower sales to customers in the discrete factory automation and semiconductor and electronics capital equipment markets of the company s mvsd segment  which has been impacted by the worldwide economic slowdown 
late in and again during  the company implemented a number of cost cutting measures intended to reduce expenses in response to lower revenue expectations 
although operating expenses prior to restructuring charges were down from the prior year  the significantly lower revenue  as well as the impact of restructuring charges  resulted in an operating loss of  for  compared to operating income of  for although the company recorded lower revenue in than  the fourth quarter of was the third quarter in a row that demand from customers increased on a sequential basis 
order levels also increased over the prior year in the fourth quarter of for the first time since the third quarter of while we anticipate revenue growth and a profit from continuing operations in  our business plan assumes that the worldwide economy will continue its recovery and our financial results are subject to this assumption and other risks as more fully described in part i item a of this annual report on form k

table of contents stock based compensation the total stock based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit recognized was  and  respectively  in and  and  respectively in no compensation expense was capitalized as of december  or december  stock based compensation expense decreased in from the prior year as a result of a declining trend in the number of stock options granted  as well as lower grant date fair values primarily due to a lower stock price 
stock based compensation expense was relatively high in the fourth quarter of due to the acceleration of the expense related to unvested stock options that were tendered by employees in the company s cash tender offer for certain underwater options  in particular in mvsd sg a refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this annual report on form k 
we expect stock based compensation expense to be relatively low in the first quarter of due to the declining trend in the number of stock options granted  the accelerated expense taken in related to unvested stock options tendered by employees  as well as an anticipated credit related to forfeited stock options 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested stock options was  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue revenue for the year ended december  decreased by  or  from the prior year due to lower sales to customers in the discrete factory automation and semiconductor and electronics capital equipment markets 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates had little impact on total revenue for the full year compared to a stronger us dollar relative to the euro  on average  in compared to contributed to lower revenue  as sales denominated in euros were translated to us dollars 
this impact was offset  however  by the favorable impact on revenue of a weaker us dollar relative to the japanese yen 
discrete factory automation market sales to manufacturing customers in the discrete factory automation area  which are included in the company s mvsd segment  represented of total revenue in compared to of total revenue in sales to these customers decreased by  or  from the prior year 
demand from the company s factory automation customers has been affected by the worldwide economic slowdown  which first began to impact the company s orders from these customers in the third quarter of while factory automation sales declined from the prior year in all of the company s major geographic regions  the largest dollar decreases were experienced in europe and the united states where the company has a broad base of factory automation customers 
however  the fourth quarter of was the third quarter in a row that demand from these customers increased on a sequential basis 
order levels also increased over the prior year in the fourth quarter of for the first time since the third quarter of while we anticipate demand and revenue from these customers will increase in  our business plan assumes a continued worldwide economic recovery that generates factory automation projects 
semiconductor and electronics capital equipment market sales to customers who make automation equipment for the semiconductor and electronics industries  which are included in the company s mvsd segment  represented of total revenue in compared to of total revenue in sales to these customers decreased by  or  from the prior year due to industry cyclicality  as well as competitive market pressures 
geographically  revenue decreased most significantly in japan where many of the company s semiconductor and electronics capital equipment customers are located 
in recent years  the competitive landscape in this market has 
table of contents changed  as price and flexibility of purchasing hardware from other vendors have become more important factors in our customers purchasing decisions 
to address this market change  the company has introduced software only products  however  the average selling price of these offerings is significantly lower than for a complete vision system  and therefore  we expect this trend to have a negative impact on our revenue in this market 
although the fourth quarter of was the third quarter in a row that demand increased on a sequential basis and order levels increased over the prior year in the fourth quarter of  demand from these customers remains at historically low levels and we have limited visibility regarding future order levels from these customers 
surface inspection market sales to surface inspection customers  which comprise the company s sisd segment  represented of total revenue in compared to of total revenue in revenue from these customers increased by  or  from the prior year 
while demand for the company s surface inspection customers has not been significantly impacted by worldwide economic conditions to date  these conditions have increased competitive market pressures resulting in higher discounting of products in order to maintain and grow market share 
product revenue product revenue decreased by  or  from the prior year primarily due to a lower volume of vision systems sold to customers in the discrete factory automation and semiconductor and electronics capital equipment markets 
although average selling prices declined from the prior year as the company introduced new products at lower price points  including software only products  the lower volume of units sold was the primary driver behind the decline in product revenue 
product revenue in the first quarter of included  related to an arrangement with a single customer for which product was shipped during and  but revenue was deferred until the final unit was delivered in the first quarter of service revenue service revenue  which is derived from the sale of maintenance and support  education  consulting  and installation services  decreased by  or  from the prior year primarily due to lower maintenance and support revenue 
the lower maintenance and support revenue was partially offset by higher revenue from surface inspection installation services 
maintenance and support revenue has declined due to the introduction of new products and functionality that make vision easier to use and require less maintenance and support 
service revenue increased as a percentage of total revenue to in from in gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenue was for compared to for this decrease was primarily due to lower mvsd product margins  as described below  as well as a higher percentage of total revenue from the sale of surface inspection systems  which have lower margins than the sale of modular vision systems 
mvsd margin mvsd gross margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the decrease in mvsd margin was primarily due to a lower product margin resulting from the impact of relatively flat new product introduction costs on a lower revenue base  as well as higher provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
these negative impacts were partially offset by the higher than average margin achieved on a  revenue arrangement recognized in the first quarter of this arrangement included the transfer of source code  as well as the delivery of product  which resulted in a 
table of contents higher selling price and a higher margin on the overall arrangement 
we expect our mvsd margins would improve if we are able to achieve higher revenue levels in sisd margin sisd gross margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the decrease in sisd margin was primarily due to higher discounting of products in response to competitive market pressures 
a higher percentage of service revenue from installation services  which have lower margins than the sale of maintenance and support  spare parts  and repairs  also contributed to the decline in the sisd margin 
we do not anticipate sisd margins will change significantly over the next year due to continued competitive market pressures 
product margin product gross margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in this decrease was primarily due to the lower mvsd product margin as described above  as well as a higher percentage of total revenue from the sale of surface inspection systems  which have lower margins than the sale of modular vision systems 
this decrease was partially offset by the higher than average margin achieved on a  revenue arrangement recognized in the first quarter of service margin service gross margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in although maintenance and support costs declined from the prior year due to improvements in product ease of use  service revenue declined at a greater rate 
operating expenses research  development  and engineering expenses research  development  and engineering rd e expenses decreased by  or  from the prior year 
mvsd rd e expenses decreased by  or  and sisd rd e expenses decreased  or the decrease in mvsd rd e expenses was due to lower company bonus accruals  and lower stock based compensation expense  as well as the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the us dollar was stronger relative to the euro in compared to  resulting in lower rd e costs when expenses of the company s european operations were translated into us dollars 
in november and again in april  the company implemented a number of cost cutting measures intended to reduce expenses in response to lower revenue expectations 
these measures included mvsd rd e headcount reductions  primarily in the united states  which lowered the company s personnel related costs  such as salaries and fringe benefits 
other cost cutting measures  including mandatory shutdown days in the third quarter and a lower company contribution to employees k plans in the second half of  also lowered the company s fringe benefit costs 
in addition  tighter controls over spending resulted in lower expenses related to outside services  and materials and supplies

mvsd sg a expenses decreased by  or  while sisd sg a expenses decreased by  or 
corporate expenses that are not allocated to either division decreased by  or 
the decrease in mvsd sg a expenses was due to the impact of cost cutting measures implemented by the company in november and again in april intended to reduce expenses in response to lower revenue expectations 
these measures included headcount reductions across all regions  which lowered the company s personnel related costs  such as salaries  fringe benefits  commissions and travel 
in addition to lower spending related to headcount levels  travel decreased due to tighter controls over discretionary spending and lower air travel rates 
other reductions in discretionary spending included lower marketing and promotional expense  lower expenses related to the company s sales kick off meetings  and lower expenses related to outside services  and materials and supplies 
lower amortization expense  and impairment charges  refer to to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this annual report related to intangible assets  as well as the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  also contributed to the decrease in expenses 
these savings were partially offset by higher stock based compensation expense primarily related to the expensing of unvested stock options that were tendered by employees in the fourth quarter of  net of the impact of a declining trend in the number of stock options granted  as well as lower grant date fair values

restructuring charges november in november  the company announced the closure of its facility in duluth  georgia  which will result in long term cost savings 
this facility included a distribution center for mvsd customers located in the americas  an engineering group dedicated to supporting the company s mvsd vision systems products  and a sales training and support group  as well as a team of finance support staff 
during the second quarter of  this distribution center was consolidated into the company s headquarters in natick  massachusetts  resulting in a single distribution center for mvsd customers located in the americas 
although a portion of the engineering and sales training and support positions have been transferred to other locations  the majority of these positions  and all of the finance positions  have been eliminated 
the company achieved expense savings of approximately  in  which were partially offset by  of restructuring costs  and expects to achieve expense savings of approximately  in related to the closure of the duluth  georgia facility 
the company hired fewer employees to staff the new distribution center in natick  massachusetts than originally planned  resulting in higher estimated cost savings than the original estimate

other income expense also includes rental income  net of associated expenses  from leasing buildings adjacent to the company s corporate headquarters 
net rental income increased from the prior year due to the purchase of additional property adjacent to the company s headquarters during the second quarter of that is generating rental income for the company

these discrete events increased the effective tax rate in from to the effective tax rate excluding discrete tax events increased from to as a result of more of the company s profits being earned in higher tax jurisdictions  as well as less of the company s investment income coming from tax exempt investment vehicles 
discontinued operations in july  the company sold all of the assets of its lane departure warning business to takata holdings inc for  in cash 
the company entered the lane departure warning business in may with the acquisition of assistware technology  inc  a small company that had developed a vision system that could provide a warning to drivers when their vehicle was about to inadvertently cross a lane 
after the purchase  the company invested additional funds to commercialize assistware s product and to establish a business developing and selling lane departure warning products for driver assistance 
this business was reported under the company s mvsd segment  but was never integrated into other cognex businesses 
during the second quarter of  the company determined that this business did not fit the company s business model  primarily because car and truck manufacturers want to work exclusively with their existing tier one suppliers and  although these suppliers have expressed interest in the company s vision technology  they would require access to and control of the company s proprietary software 
accordingly  the company accepted an offer from one of these suppliers and sold the lane departure warning business 
management concluded that the assets of the lane departure warning business met all of the criteria to be classified as held for sale as of june  accordingly  the company recorded a  loss in the second quarter of to reduce the carrying amount of these assets down to their fair value less costs to sell 
management also concluded that the disposal group met the criteria of a discontinued operation  and has presented the loss from operations of this discontinued business separate from continuing operations on the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company has historically been able to generate positive cash flow from operations  which has funded its operating activities and other cash requirements and has resulted in an accumulated cash  cash equivalent  and investment balance of  as of december  the company has established guidelines relative to credit ratings  diversification  and maturities of its investments that maintain liquidity 
the company s cash requirements during the year ended december  were met with its existing cash balances and cash from investment maturities 
in addition  despite a decline in business in  the company was able to generate positive cash flows from operations 
cash requirements primarily consisted of operating activities  capital expenditures  the acquisition of the web monitoring business of monitoring technology corporation  the payment of dividends  and payments for underwater stock options that were tendered by employees in the fourth quarter of capital expenditures for totaled  and consisted primarily of costs to establish a distribution center in natick  massachusetts  as well as expenditures for leasehold improvements at the company s sisd headquarters  computer hardware  and manufacturing test equipment related to new product introductions 
we expect our capital expenditures for to be lower than  as included costs related to the natick distribution center 
late in and again during  the company implemented a number of cost cutting measures intended to reduce expenses in response to lower revenue expectations 
restructuring charges for these actions are expected to total  of which  was paid out during the fourth quarter of and  was paid out during the remaining  is expected to be paid out in the first half of in november  the company commenced a cash tender offer for certain underwater stock options held by employees  officers  and directors 
in december  options to purchase a total of  shares of the company s common stock were tendered under the offer for an aggregate cash payment of  of which  was paid out in december and  was paid out in january this is the first time the company has offered to purchase outstanding stock options in exchange for cash  and there is no intent to make another such offer 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalent  and investment balances  together with cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet its operating  investing  and financing activities for the next twelve months 
as of december   the company had approximately  in either cash or investments that could be converted into cash 
in addition  cognex has no long term debt and we do not anticipate needing debt financing in the near future 
we believe that our strong cash position  together with the cost cutting measures we implemented over the past several months  put us in a relatively good position with respect to our longer term liquidity needs 
the following table summarizes the company s material contractual obligations  both fixed and contingent in thousands venrock limited inventory partnership purchase year ended december  interest commitments leases total thereafter the company may be required to make cash outlays related to its unrecognized tax benefits 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with its unrecognized tax benefits  the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the

in june  the company became a limited partner in venrock associates iii  lp venrock  a venture capital fund 
a director of the company was a general partner of venrock associates 
the company has committed to a total investment in the limited partnership of up to  with the commitment period expiring on december  the company does not have the right to withdraw from the partnership prior to december  as of december   the company had contributed  to the partnership  including  during no distributions were received during the remaining commitment of  can be called by venrock at any time through in addition to the obligations described above  the following items may also result in future material uses of cash stock repurchase program in april  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of  of the company s common stock 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares at a cost of  under this program 
the company did not purchase any shares under this program during the year ended december  the company may repurchase shares under this program in future periods depending upon a variety of factors  including  among other things  the stock price level  share availability  and cash reserve requirements 
dividends beginning in the third quarter of  the company s board of directors has declared and paid a cash dividend in each quarter  including a dividend of per share in the first quarter of and a dividend of per share in the second  third  and fourth quarters of that amounted to  for the year ended december  on february   the company s board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share payable in the first quarter of future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the company s board of directors and will depend upon such factors as the board deems relevant  including  among other things  the company s ability to generate positive cash flow from operations 
acquisitions on september   the company acquired the web monitoring business of monitoring technology corporation mtc 
the company paid  in cash  with  paid upon closing and  paid during the fourth quarter of there are no contingent payments 
the purchase price was subject to a working capital adjustment  which amounted to  and was paid to cognex in the fourth quarter of  thereby reducing the purchase price to  the company s business strategy includes selective expansion into new machine vision applications through the acquisition of businesses and technologies  which may result in significant cash outlays in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company had no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on 
table of contents historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or circumstances resulting in charges that could be material in future reporting periods 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition management exercises judgment in connection with the determination of the amount of revenue to be recognized each period 
such judgments include  but are not limited to  determining whether separate contracts with the same customer that are entered into at or near the same time should be accounted for as a single arrangement  identifying the various elements in an arrangement  determining whether options to buy additional products or services in the future are substantive and should be accounted for as an element in the original arrangement  determining the probability of collecting the receivable  assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable  determining whether customer specified acceptance criteria are substantive in nature  and assessing whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value has been established for undelivered elements 
investments as of december   the company s investment balance totaled  of which  consisted of municipal bonds 
debt securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  recorded in shareholders equity as other comprehensive income loss 
as of december   the company s portfolio of debt securities had net unrealized gains totaling the remaining investment balance of  represented a limited partnership interest in venrock associates iii  lp  a venture capital fund with an investment focus on information technology and health care and life sciences 
a director of the company was a general partner of venrock associates 
the company s limited partnership interest is accounted for using the cost method because our investment is less than of the partnership and we have no influence over the partnership s operating and financial policies 
as of december   the carrying value of this investment was  compared to an estimated fair value of  the fair value of the company s limited partnership interest is based upon valuations of the partnership s investments as determined by the general partner 
publicly traded investments in active markets are reported at the market closing price less a discount  as appropriate  to reflect restricted marketability 
fair value for private investments for which observable market prices in active markets do not exist is based upon the best information available including the value of a recent financing  reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies such as revenue multiples  public or private transactions such as the sale of a comparable company  and valuations for publicly traded comparable companies 
the amount determined to be fair value also incorporates the general partner s own judgment and close familiarity with the business activities of each portfolio company 
these valuations are judgmental and require the use of many assumptions and estimates  and changes in these assumptions could result in an impairment charge in future periods 
the majority of the partnership s portfolio consists of investments in early stage  private companies characterized by a high degree of risk  volatility  and illiquidity  and the global economic downturn and credit market crisis have made the environment for these startups much less forgiving 
as a result  it is possible that some of the younger companies in the portfolio that require capital investments to fund their current operations may not be as well prepared to survive this slowdown as would a more mature company 
these factors make the assumptions and estimates used in the fair valuation calculations more judgmental 
management monitors the carrying value of its investments compared to their fair value to determine whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
if a decline in fair value is considered to be other than temporary  an impairment charge would be recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
in considering whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary  we consider many factors  both qualitative 
table of contents and quantitative in nature 
some of these factors include the duration and extent of the fair value decline  the length of the company s commitment to the investment  and general economic  stock market  and interest rate trends 
in the case of the company s limited partnership investment  specific communications from the general partner are also considered in this evaluation 
if a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge would be recorded in current operations 
there were no other than temporary impairments of investments in   or if the fair value of the company s limited partnership interest decreases below its current carrying value  which would represent a decline of greater than  the company may be required to record an impairment charge related to this asset 
accounts receivable the company maintains reserves against its accounts receivable for potential credit losses 
ongoing credit evaluations of customers are performed and the company has historically not experienced significant losses related to the collection of its accounts receivable 
allowances for specific accounts determined to be at risk for collection are estimated by management taking into account the length of time the receivable has been outstanding  the customer s current ability to pay its obligations to the company  general economic and industry conditions  as well as various other factors 
the global economic slowdown and credit crisis may result in longer payment cycles and challenges in collecting accounts receivable balances  which make these estimates more judgmental 
an adverse change in any of these factors could result in higher than expected customer defaults and may result in the need for additional bad debt provisions 
as of december   the company s reserve against accounts receivable was  or of the gross accounts receivable balance 
a difference in the reserve against accounts receivable as of december  would have affected net income by approximately  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
management estimates excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand  product transitions  and market conditions  and records reserves to reduce the carrying value of inventories to their net realizable value 
the global economic slowdown makes these assumptions about future demand more judgmental 
among the risks associated with the introduction of new products are difficulty predicting customer demand and effectively managing inventory levels to ensure adequate supply of the new product and avoid excess supply of the legacy product 
in addition  we may strategically enter into non cancelable commitments with vendors to purchase materials for products in advance of demand in order to take advantage of favorable pricing or address concerns about the availability of future supplies 
as of december   the company s reserve for excess and obsolete inventory totaled  or of the gross inventory balance 
a difference in inventory reserves as of december  would have affected net income by approximately  long lived assets the company has long lived assets including property  plant  and equipment and acquired intangible assets 
these assets are susceptible to shortened estimated useful lives and changes in fair value due to changes in their use  market or economic changes  or other events or circumstances 
the company evaluates the potential impairment of these long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include historical or projected results that are less than the assumptions used in the original valuation of an acquired asset  a change in the company s business strategy or its use of an acquired asset  or negative economic or industry trends 
if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable  the company assesses the recoverability of the assets by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives 
if the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows  the company compares the fair value of the long lived assets to the carrying value and records an impairment loss for the difference 
the company generally estimates the fair value of its long lived assets using the income 
table of contents approach based upon a discounted cash flow model 
the income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenues and expenses  as well as discount factors and income tax rates 
current worldwide economic conditions make these assumptions and estimates more judgmental 
the company recorded an impairment loss on an intangible asset in the third quarter of and another intangible asset in the first quarter of based on lower revenue expected to be generated from the respective assets 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from those used in assessing the recoverability of these assets and could result in an impairment of long lived assets in future periods 
goodwill management evaluates the potential impairment of goodwill for each of its reporting units annually each fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company has identified two reporting units for its goodwill test mvsd and sisd 
determining the company s reporting units requires judgments regarding what constitutes a business and at what level discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
step one compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  step two is required to determine if there is an impairment of the goodwill 
step two compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of the goodwill 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using the income approach based upon a discounted cash flow model 
in addition  the company uses the market approach  which compares the reporting unit to publicly traded companies and transactions involving similar businesses  to support the conclusions based upon the income approach 
the income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenues  expenses  capital expenditures  and working capital  as well as discount factors and income tax rates 
current worldwide economic conditions make these assumptions and estimates more judgmental 
changes in these assumptions could result in an impairment of goodwill in future periods 
the company prepared the annual goodwill analysis as of october  and concluded that no impairment charge was required as of that date 
the mvsd reporting unit had a goodwill balance of  and the sisd reporting unit had a goodwill balance of  as of december  at that date  the fair value of the mvsd unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately  while the fair value of the sisd unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
if the company is not able to achieve the revenue growth or cost savings assumed in its fair value calculations  it could result in an impairment of goodwill in future periods 
warranty obligations the company records the estimated cost of fulfilling product warranties at the time of sale based upon historical costs to fulfill claims 
obligations may also be recorded subsequent to the time of sale whenever specific events or circumstances impacting product quality become known that would not have been taken into account using historical data 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers and third party contract manufacturers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
an adverse change in any of these factors may result in the need for additional warranty provisions 
as of december   the company s accrued warranty obligations amounted to  a difference in accrued warranty obligations as of december  would have affected net income by approximately contingencies estimated losses from contingencies are accrued by management based upon the likelihood of a loss and the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
estimating potential losses  or even a range of losses  is difficult and involves a great deal of judgment 
management relies primarily on assessments made by its internal and external legal counsel to make our determination as to whether a loss contingency 
table of contents arising from litigation should be recorded or disclosed 
should the resolution of a contingency result in a loss that we did not accrue because management did not believe that the loss was probable or capable of being reasonably estimated  then this loss would result in a charge to income in the period the contingency was resolved 
the company did not have any significant accrued contingencies as of december  stock based compensation compensation expense is recognized for all stock option grants 
determining the appropriate valuation model and estimating the fair values of these grants requires the input of subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  dividend yields  expected term  and forfeiture rates 
the expected volatility assumption is based partially upon the historical volatility of the company s common stock  which may or may not be a true indicator of future volatility  particularly as the company continues to seek to diversify its customer base 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair values of stock option grants represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment 
as a result  if factors change and different assumptions are used  stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the company recorded in the current period 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining worldwide income tax expense based upon tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the company has established reserves for uncertain tax positions by applying the more likely than not criteria  under which the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authority 
all tax positions are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant modification  such as the completion of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations  which may result in future charges or credits to income tax expense 
as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations outside of the united states within the next twelve months  existing reserves could be released  which would decrease income tax expense by  the company is currently under audit in japan 
the tokyo regional taxation bureau is auditing tax years through and has issued a permanent establishment finding claiming that the company s irish subsidiary should be subject to taxation in japan 
the company believes it has a substantive defense against this finding and has been granted competent authority intervention in accordance with the japan ireland tax treaty 
the company believes that the tax authorities in the competent authority case between japan and ireland are close to finalizing a settlement 
nothing has been formally communicated to the company at this time 
any financial adjustments  if required  to the existing tax reserves will be recorded in the period when the company receives final notification from either japan or ireland of actual settlement 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating the current tax liability  as well as assessing temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for financial statement and tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   the company had net deferred tax assets of  primarily resulting from temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
management has evaluated the realizability of these deferred tax assets and has determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized  net of any established reserves 
in reaching this conclusion  we have evaluated relevant criteria  including the company s historical profitability  current projections of future profitability  and the lives of tax credits  net operating and capital losses  and other carryforwards  certain of which have indefinite lives 
should the company fail to generate sufficient pre tax profits in future periods  we may be required to record material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a charge to income in the period of determination 

table of contents derivative instruments in certain instances  the company enters into forward contracts and other derivative instruments to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
these contracts are used to minimize foreign currency gains or losses  as the gains or losses on these contracts are intended to offset the losses or gains on the underlying exposures 
the company does not engage in foreign currency speculation 
administering the company s foreign currency risk management program requires the use of estimates and the application of judgment  including compiling forecasts of transaction activity denominated in various currencies 
the failure to identify foreign currency exposures and construct effective hedges may result in material foreign currency gains or losses 
purchase accounting business acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
allocating the purchase price requires the company to estimate the fair value of various assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
management is responsible for determining the appropriate valuation model and estimated fair values  and in doing so  considers a number of factors  including information provided by an outside valuation advisor 
the company primarily establishes fair value using the income approach based upon a discounted cash flow model 
the income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenues and expenses  as well as discount factors and income tax rates 
new pronouncements accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements this asu updates the codification to modify the requirements for determining whether a deliverable in a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement can be treated as a separate unit of accounting 
asu removes the criteria that there be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered item s and requires the vendor to use its best estimate of the selling price of the deliverables to allocate arrangement consideration when vendor specific or third party evidence cannot be determined 
the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is no longer permitted 
by providing another alternative for determining the selling price of the deliverables  this standard allows companies to allocate revenue in multiple deliverable arrangements in a manner that better reflects the transaction s economics 
asu is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   however  early application is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year 
management is in the process of evaluating the impact of this update and whether early adoption will be elected 
management expects that the adoption of this new rule will result in earlier revenue recognition 
accounting standards update asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements this asu updates the codification to remove tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of software revenue rules 
revenue recognition for transactions that meet this definition would be similar to that for other tangible products  and asu as described above would be applicable for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   however  early application is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year 
management is in the process of evaluating the impact of this update and whether early adoption will be elected 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk the company faces exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  as a significant portion of its revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the company s subsidiaries or the reporting currency of the company  which is the 
table of contents us dollar 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve 
the company evaluates its foreign currency exposures on an ongoing basis and makes adjustments to its foreign currency risk management program as circumstances change 
the failure to identify new exposures and hedge them in an effective manner may result in material foreign currency gains or losses 
the company faces two types of foreign currency exchange rate exposures transactional currency functional currency exchange rate exposures from transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary for example  a japanese yen receivable on the company s irish subsidiary s books for which the functional currency is the euro  and functional currency reporting currency exchange rate exposures from transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which is the reporting currency of the company 
the company enters into forward contracts to hedge the transactional currency functional currency exposure of its irish subsidiary s receivables denominated in us dollars and japanese yen 
the company faces other transactional currency functional currency exposures that it may hedge from time to time 
these exposures include cash balances  prepayments  or payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary  receivables denominated in euro or japanese yen on the books of a us entity  and intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary 
the company currently has forward contracts in place to hedge a us dollar short term intercompany loan and a japanese yen prepayment on its irish subsidiary s books 
the company presently manages its other intercompany foreign currency risk by transferring cash to minimize intercompany balances at the end of each month 
forward contracts to exchange  japanese yen for euros at a weighted average settlement price of yen euro and contracts to exchange  us dollars for euros at a weighted average settlement price of usd euro  both with terms between one and six months  were outstanding as of december  these instruments at fair value had a loss of  as of december  these forward contracts are used to minimize foreign currency gains or losses  as the gains or losses on these contracts are intended to offset the losses or gains on the underlying exposures 
these forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting 
both the underlying exposures and the forward contracts are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and changes in fair value are reported as foreign currency gain loss on the consolidated statements of operations 
the company does not engage in foreign currency speculation 
the success of this hedging program depends upon forecasts of sales and collections denominated in us dollars and japanese yen 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  the company could experience unanticipated foreign currency gains or losses that could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company s functional currency reporting currency exchange rate exposures result from revenues and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the only foreign currencies in which a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated are the euro and the japanese yen 
the company s predominant currency of sale is the us dollar in the americas and southeast asia  the euro in europe  and the yen in japan 
we estimate that approximately of our sales in were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar  and we expect sales denominated in foreign currencies to continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
while we also have expenses denominated in these same foreign currencies  the impact on revenues has historically been  and is expected to continue to be  greater than the offsetting impact on expenses 
therefore  in times when the us dollar strengthens in relation to these foreign currencies  we would expect to report a net decrease in operating income 
conversely  in times when the us dollar weakens in relation to these foreign currencies  we would expect to report a net increase in operating income 

table of contents interest rate risk the company s investment portfolio includes municipal bonds 
debt securities with original maturities greater than three months are designated as available for sale and are reported at fair value 
as of december   the fair value of the company s portfolio of debt securities amounted to  with principal amounts totaling  maturities that do not exceed three years  and a yield to maturity of 
differences between the fair value and principal amounts of the company s portfolio of debt securities are primarily attributable to discounts and premiums arising at the acquisition date  as well as unrealized gains and losses at the balance sheet date 
given the relatively short maturities and investment grade quality of the company s portfolio of debt securities as of december   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse effect on the fair value of these instruments 
as a result  the company does not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following table presents the hypothetical change in the fair value of the company s portfolio of debt securities arising from selected potential changes in interest rates in thousands

the majority of the partnership s portfolio consists of investments in early stage  private companies characterized by a high degree of risk  volatility  and illiquidity  and the global economic downturn and credit market crisis have made the environment for these startups much less forgiving 
as a result  it is possible that some of the younger companies in the portfolio that require capital investments to fund their current operations may not be as well prepared to survive this slowdown as would a more mature company
