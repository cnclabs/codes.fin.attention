item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a growth oriented delaware limited partnership organized by anadarko to own  operate  acquire and develop midstream energy assets 
we currently operate in east and west texas  the rocky mountains utah and wyoming and the mid continent kansas and oklahoma and are engaged in the business of gathering  compressing  treating  processing and transporting natural gas for anadarko and third party producers and customers 
operating and financial highlights we achieved significant milestones during significant operational and financial highlights include in july  we acquired a membership interest in chipeta processing llc  or chipeta  together with related midstream assets from anadarko 
in october  we entered into a three year senior unsecured revolving credit facility with aggregate initial commitments of million 
this revolving credit facility matures in october and bears interest at a variable rate 
in december  we issued  common units at a price of per unit to the public 
net proceeds from the offering of approximately million were used to repay million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and to partially fund the january granger acquisition 
our stable operating cash flow along with our chipeta acquisition  combined with a focus on cost reduction and capital spending discipline  enabled us to raise our distribution over three consecutive 
table of contents quarters to per unit for the fourth quarter of  representing a increase over the distribution for the fourth quarter of although the current commodity price environment  particularly for natural gas  has resulted in lower drilling activity throughout the areas in which we operate  throughput decreases were substantially offset by throughput increases at the chipeta plant and fort union system due to facility expansions 
the throughput attributable to western gas partners  lp  for the year ended december   totaled approximately  mmcf d  representing an approximate decrease compared to the year ended december  acquisitions concurrent with the closing of the initial public offering in may  anadarko contributed the assets and liabilities of agc  pgt and migc to us in exchange for a general partner interest  of the idrs   common units and  subordinated units 
in connection with the powder river acquisition in december  anadarko contributed the powder river assets to us for consideration consisting of million in cash  which was funded by a note from anadarko   common units and  general partner units 
in connection with the chipeta acquisition in july  anadarko contributed the chipeta assets to us for consideration consisting of million in cash  which was funded by a note from anadarko   common units and  general partner units 
in november  chipeta closed its million acquisition from a third party of the natural buttes plant 
in connection with the granger acquisition in january  anadarko contributed the granger assets to us for consideration consisting of million in cash  which was funded with million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and million of cash on hand  as well as the issuance of  common units to anadarko and  general partner units to our general partner 
see the caption acquisitions under items and of this annual report for additional transaction and asset descriptions 
because anadarko owns the partnership s general partner  each acquisition of partnership assets  except the natural buttes plant  was considered a transfer of net assets between entities under common control 
as a result  after each acquisition of assets from anadarko  we are required to revise our financial statements to include the activities of the those assets as of the date of common control 
our historical financial statements for the years ended december  and as presented in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   which included the results attributable to the powder river assets  have been recast to reflect the results attributable to the chipeta assets as if the partnership owned a interest in chipeta and associated midstream assets for all periods presented

for ease of reference  we refer to the historical financial results of the partnership assets prior to our acquisitions as being our historical financial results 
unless the context otherwise requires  references to we  us  our  the partnership or western gas partners are intended to refer to the business and operations of agc and pgt from their inception through the closing date of our initial public offering and to western gas partners  lp and its subsidiaries thereafter  combined with the business and operations of migc and the powder river assets since august  and combined with the business and operations of the chipeta assets since august  anadarko refers to anadarko petroleum corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries  excluding the partnership and parent refers to anadarko prior to our acquisition of assets from anadarko 
affiliates refers to wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries of anadarko  excluding the partnership 
our results are driven primarily by the volumes of natural gas we gather  compress  process  treat or transport through our systems 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenues and of our gathering  processing and transportation throughput volumes were attributable to transactions entered into with anadarko 
in our gathering operations  we contract with producers and customers to gather natural gas from individual wells located near our gathering systems 
we connect wells to gathering lines through which natural gas may be compressed and delivered to a processing plant  treating facility or downstream pipeline  and ultimately to end users 
we also treat a significant portion of the natural gas that we gather so that it will satisfy required specifications for pipeline transportation 
effective january  and solely with respect to the gathering systems connected to our initial assets  we received a significant dedication from our largest customer  anadarko 
specifically  anadarko has dedicated to us all of the natural gas production it owns or controls from i wells that are currently connected to such gathering systems  and ii additional wells that are drilled within one mile of wells connected to such gathering systems  as those systems currently exist and as they are expanded to connect additional wells in the future 
as a result  this dedication will continue to expand as additional wells are connected to these gathering systems 
based on gross margin for the year ended december   approximately of our services are provided pursuant to fee based contracts under which we are paid a fixed fee based on the volume and thermal content of the natural gas we gather  process  compress  treat or transport 
this type of contract provides us with a relatively stable revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity price risk  except to the extent that we retain and sell drip condensate that is recovered during the gathering of natural gas from the wellhead 

table of contents based on gross margin for the year ended december   approximately of our services are provided pursuant to percent of proceeds and keep whole contracts pursuant to which we have commodity price exposure 
we have fixed price swap agreements with anadarko to manage the commodity price risk inherent in substantially all of our percent of proceeds and keep whole contracts 
see note transactions with affiliates of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
for the year ended december   approximately of our gross margin is attributable to drip condensate and approximately of our gross margin is attributable to equity income from our interest in fort union  changes in our imbalance positions and other revenue 
we also have indirect exposure to commodity price risk in that persistent low commodity prices may cause our current or potential customers to delay drilling or shut in production  which would reduce the volumes of natural gas available for gathering  compressing  treating  processing and transporting by our systems 
we also bear a limited degree of commodity price risk through settlement of natural gas imbalances 
please read item a of this annual report 
we provide a significant portion of our transportation services on our migc system through firm contracts that obligate our customers to pay a monthly reservation or demand charge  which is a fixed charge applied to firm contract capacity and owed by a customer regardless of the actual pipeline capacity used by that customer 
when a customer uses the capacity it has reserved under these contracts  we are entitled to collect an additional commodity usage charge based on the actual volume of natural gas transported 
these usage charges are typically a small percentage of the total revenues received from our firm capacity contracts 
we also provide transportation services through interruptible contracts  pursuant to which a fee is charged to our customers based upon actual volumes transported through the pipeline 
as a result of our initial public offering  the powder river acquisition and the chipeta acquisition  the results of operations  financial condition and cash flows vary significantly for and as compared to periods ending prior to our initial public offering 
please see the caption items affecting the comparability of our financial results  set forth below in this item how we evaluate our operations our management relies on certain financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance 
these metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include throughput  gross margin  operating and maintenance expenses  general and administrative expenses  adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow 
throughput 
throughput is the most important operational variable in assessing our ability to generate revenues 
in order to maintain or increase throughput on our gathering and processing systems  we must connect additional wells to our systems 
our success in maintaining or increasing throughput is impacted by successful drilling of new wells by producers that are dedicated to our systems  recompletions of existing wells connected to our systems  our ability to secure volumes from new wells drilled on non dedicated acreage and our ability to attract natural gas volumes currently gathered  processed or treated by our competitors 
during the year ended december   we added receipt points to our systems with average initial throughput of approximately mmcf d per receipt point 
to maintain and increase throughput on our migc system  we must continue to contract capacity to shippers  including producers and marketers  for transportation of their natural gas 
although firm capacity on the migc system is fully subscribed  we nevertheless monitor producer and marketing activities in the area served by our transportation system to identify new opportunities and to attempt to maintain a full subscription of migc s firm capacity 
gross margin 
we define gross margin as total revenues less cost of product 
we consider gross margin to provide information useful in assessing our results of operations and our ability to internally fund capital expenditures and to service or incur additional debt 
cost of product expenses include i costs associated with the purchase of natural gas and ngls pursuant to our percent of proceeds and keep whole processing 
table of contents contracts  ii costs associated with the valuation of our gas imbalances  iii costs associated with our obligations under certain contracts to redeliver a volume of natural gas to shippers which is thermally equivalent to condensate retained by us and sold to third parties and iv costs associated with our fuel tracking mechanism  which tracks the difference between actual fuel usage and loss  and amounts recovered for estimated fuel usage and loss pursuant to our contracts 
these expenses are subject to variability  although our exposure to commodity price risk attributable to our percent of proceeds and keep whole contracts is mitigated through our commodity price swap agreements with anadarko 
operating and maintenance expenses 
we monitor operating and maintenance expenses to assess the impact of such costs on the profitability of our assets and to evaluate the overall efficiency of our operations 
operation and maintenance expenses include  among other things  field labor  insurance  repair and maintenance  contract services  utility costs and services provided to us or on our behalf 
for periods commencing on and subsequent to our acquisition of the partnership assets  certain of these expenses are incurred under and governed by our services and secondment agreement with anadarko 
general and administrative expenses 
to help ensure the appropriateness of our general and administrative expenses and maximize our cash available for distribution  we monitor such expenses through comparison to prior periods  the annual budget approved by our general partner s board of directors  as well as to general and administrative expenses incurred by similar midstream companies 
general and administrative expenses for periods prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets include reimbursements attributable to costs incurred by anadarko on our behalf and allocations of general and administrative costs by anadarko to us 
for these periods  anadarko received compensation or reimbursement through a management services fee 
for periods subsequent to our acquisition of the partnership assets  anadarko is no longer compensated for corporate services through a management services fee 
instead  we reimburse anadarko for general and administrative expenses it incurs on our behalf pursuant to the terms of our omnibus agreement with anadarko 
amounts required to be reimbursed to anadarko under the omnibus agreement include those expenses attributable to our status as a publicly traded partnership  such as expenses associated with annual and quarterly reporting  tax return and schedule k preparation and distribution expenses  expenses associated with listing on the new york stock exchange  and independent auditor fees  legal expenses  investor relations expenses  director fees  and registrar and transfer agent fees 
in addition to the above  we are required pursuant to the terms of the omnibus agreement with anadarko to reimburse anadarko for allocable general and administrative expenses 
the amount required to be reimbursed by us to anadarko for certain allocated general and administrative expenses was capped at million for the year ended december  in connection with the january granger acquisition  the cap under the omnibus agreement was increased to million for the year ended december   subject to adjustment to reflect expansions of our operations through the acquisition or construction of new assets or businesses and with the concurrence of the special committee of our general partner s board of directors 
if the omnibus agreement is not further amended by the parties  our general partner will determine the general and administrative expenses to be reimbursed by us in accordance with our partnership agreement for periods subsequent to december  the cap contained in the omnibus agreement does not apply to incremental general and administrative expenses incurred by or allocated to us as a result of being a separate publicly traded entity 
public company expenses not subject to the cap contained in the omnibus agreement  excluding equity based compensation  were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss attributable to western gas partners  lp  plus distributions from equity investee  non cash equity based compensation expense  expenses in excess of the omnibus cap  interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization  less income from equity investments  interest income  income tax benefit and other income expense 

table of contents we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations and that adjusted ebitda is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and make distributions 
adjusted ebitda is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements  such as industry analysts  investors  commercial banks and rating agencies  use to assess  among other measures our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry  without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  the ability of our assets to generate cash flow to make distributions  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities 
distributable cash flow 
we define distributable cash flow as adjusted ebitda  plus interest income  less net cash paid for interest expense  maintenance capital expenditures  and income taxes 
we use distributable cash flow to compare distributable cash flow to the cash distributions we expect to pay our unitholders 
using this measure  management can quickly compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to planned cash distributions 
we believe this measure is useful to investors because this measurement is used by many companies  analysts and others in the industry as a performance measurement tool to evaluate our operating and financial performance and compare it with the performance of other publicly traded partnerships 
we did not utilize a distributable cash flow measure prior to becoming a publicly traded partnership in and  as such  did not differentiate between maintenance and capital expenditures prior to and do not report distributable cash flow for periods prior to distributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income  earnings per unit  operating income  cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
distributable cash flow excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and operating income and this measure may vary among other companies 
therefore  distributable cash flow as presented may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other companies 
furthermore  while distributable cash flow is a measure we use to assess our ability to make distributions to our unitholders  it should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that we have available for distributions or that we plan to distribute for a given period 
reconciliation to gaap measures 
adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are not defined in gaap 
the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net income attributable to western gas partners  lp and net cash provided by operating activities and the gaap measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net income 
our non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to the gaap measures of net income or net cash provided by operating activities 
adjusted ebitda has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities 
you should not consider adjusted ebitda or distributable cash flow in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry  our definitions of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies  thereby diminishing its utility 
management compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap measures  understanding the differences between adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow compared to as applicable net income and net cash provided by operating activities  and incorporating this knowledge into its decision making processes 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results 

table of contents the following tables present a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda to the gaap financial measures of net income attributable to western gas partners  lp and net cash provided by operating activities and a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure of distributable cash flow to the gaap financial measure of net income year ended december  in thousands reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income attributable to western gas partners  lp adjusted ebitda less distributions from equity investee non cash equity based compensation expense expenses in excess of omnibus cap interest expense  net income tax expense depreciation and amortization impairment other expense  net add equity income  net interest income from note affiliate other income  net net income attributable to western gas partners  lp reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda attributable to noncontrolling interests interest income expense  net expenses in excess of omnibus cap non cash equity based compensation expense current income tax expense other income expense  net distributions from equity investee less than in excess of equity income  net changes in operating working capital accounts receivable and natural gas imbalances accounts payable and accrued expenses other  including changes in non current assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities financial information for and has been revised to include results attributable to the chipeta assets

items affecting the comparability of our financial results our historic results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented may not be comparable to future results of operations or cash flows for the reasons described below general and administrative expenses under the omnibus agreement 
pursuant to the omnibus agreement  anadarko performs centralized corporate functions for the partnership  such as legal  accounting  treasury  cash management  investor relations  insurance administration and claims processing  risk management  health  safety and environmental  information technology  human resources  credit  payroll  internal audit  tax  marketing and midstream administration 
prior to our ownership of the partnership assets  our historical consolidated financial statements reflect a management services fee representing the general and administrative expenses attributable to the partnership assets 
during the years ended december  and  anadarko billed us million and million  respectively  in allocated general and administrative expenses subject to the cap contained in the omnibus agreement 
this amount is greater than amounts allocated to us by anadarko for the aggregate management services fees reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements for periods prior to our ownership of the partnership assets and will increase in future periods as we acquire additional assets 
in addition  our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   included million of expenses incurred by anadarko in excess of the cap contained in the omnibus agreement 
such expenses were recorded as a capital contribution from anadarko and did not impact the partnership s cash flows 
we also incurred million and million in public company expenses  excluding equity based 
table of contents compensation  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we did not incur public company expenses prior to our initial public offering in may interest expense on intercompany balances 
for periods prior to may   with respect to our initial assets  prior to december   with respect to the powder river assets  and prior to june  the date on which anadarko initially contributed assets to chipeta  with respect to chipeta  we incurred interest expense or earned interest income on current intercompany balances with anadarko 
these intercompany balances were extinguished through non cash transactions in connection with the closing of our initial public offering  the powder river acquisition and anadarko s initial contribution of assets to chipeta  therefore  interest expense and interest income attributable to these balances is reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements for the periods ending prior to and including may   with respect to our initial assets  prior to and including june   with respect to chipeta  and prior to and including december   with respect to the powder river assets 
note receivable from anadarko 
concurrent with the closing of our initial public offering  we loaned million to anadarko in exchange for a year note bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 
for periods including and subsequent to may   interest income attributable to the note is reflected in our consolidated financial statements so long as the note remains outstanding 
term loan agreements and revolving credit agreement 
in connection with the powder river acquisition in december  we entered into a five year  million term loan agreement with anadarko  under which we pay interest at a fixed rate of for the first two years and a floating rate of interest at three month libor plus basis points for the final three years 
in connection with the chipeta acquisition in july  we entered into a three year  fixed rate  million term loan agreement with anadarko 
in october  we borrowed million under our new revolving credit facility and used million of cash on hand to refinance the million three year term loan with anadarko and related accrued interest 
in december  we issued million common units in connection with our equity offering and repaid the million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
in january  we borrowed million under the revolving credit facility to partially fund the granger acquisition 
interest expense on our notes and credit facilities will be incurred so long as debt remains outstanding 
cash management 
we expect to rely upon external financing sources  including commercial bank borrowings and long term debt and equity issuances  to fund our acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures 
historically  we largely relied on internally generated cash flows and capital contributions from anadarko to satisfy our capital expenditure requirements 
prior to may   with respect to our initial assets  and prior to december   with respect to the powder river assets  all affiliate transactions were net settled within our consolidated financial statements and were funded by anadarko s working capital 
effective on may   with respect to our initial assets  and effective on december   with respect to the powder river assets  all affiliate and third party transactions are funded by our working capital 
prior to june  with respect to chipeta  sales and purchases related to third party transactions were received or paid in cash by anadarko within the centralized cash management system and were settled with chipeta through an adjustment to parent net investment 
subsequent to june   chipeta cash settled transactions directly with third parties and with anadarko affiliates 
this impacts the comparability of our cash flow statements  working capital analysis and liquidity 
commodity price swap agreements 
our financial results for historical periods reflect commodity price changes  which  in turn  impact the financial results derived from our percent of proceeds and keep whole processing contracts 
effective january   substantially all commodity price risk associated with our percent of proceeds and keep whole processing contracts has been mitigated through our fixed price commodity price swap agreements with anadarko that extend through december   with an option to extend through see note transactions with affiliates of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item in this annual report 

table of contents federal income taxes 
we are generally not subject to federal or state income tax other than texas margin tax 
federal and state income tax expense was recorded for periods ending prior to may   with respect to income generated by our initial assets  prior to june   with respect to income generated by the chipeta assets  and prior to december   with respect to income generated by the powder river assets 
for periods including and subsequent to may   with respect to income generated by our initial assets  including and subsequent to june   with respect to income generated by the chipeta assets  and including and subsequent to december   with respect to income generated by the powder river assets  we are no longer subject to federal income tax and are only subject to texas margin tax  therefore  income tax expense attributable to texas margin tax will continue to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
we are required to make payments to anadarko pursuant to a tax sharing arrangement for our share of texas margin tax included in any combined or consolidated returns of anadarko 
distributions 
we made cash distributions to our unitholders and our general partner following our initial public offering in may during the years ended december  and  the partnership paid cash distributions to its unitholders of approximately million and million  respectively 
on january   the board of directors of the partnership s general partner declared a cash distribution to the partnership s unitholders of per unit for the three months ended december   which equates to approximately million per full quarter  or approximately million per full year  based on the number of common  subordinated and general partner units outstanding as of march  equity based compensation plans 
in connection with the closing of our initial public offering  our general partner adopted two new compensation plans the western gas partners  lp long term incentive plan  or ltip  and the amended and restated western gas holdings  llc equity incentive plan  or the incentive plan 
phantom unit grants have been made under the ltip and incentive unit grants have been made under the incentive plan 
these grants result in equity based compensation expense which is determined  in part  by reference to the fair value of equity compensation as of the date of grant 
for periods ending prior to may   equity based compensation expense attributable to the ltip and incentive plan is not reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements as there were no outstanding equity grants under either plan 
for periods including and subsequent to may   the partnership s general and administrative expenses include equity based compensation costs allocated by anadarko to the partnership for grants made under the ltip and incentive plan as well as under the anadarko petroleum corporation stock incentive plan and the anadarko petroleum corporation omnibus incentive compensation plan anadarko s plans are referred to collectively as the anadarko incentive plans 
equity based compensation expense attributable to grants made under the ltip will impact our cash flows from operating activities only to the extent cash payments are made to a participant in lieu of the actual issuance of common units to the participant upon the lapse of the relevant vesting period 
equity based compensation expense attributable to grants made under the incentive plan will impact our cash flow from operating activities only to the extent cash payments are made to incentive plan participants who provided services to us pursuant to the omnibus agreement and such cash payments do not cause total annual reimbursements made by us to anadarko pursuant to the omnibus agreement to exceed the general and administrative expense limit set forth in that agreement for the periods to which such expense limit applies 
equity based compensation granted under the anadarko incentive plans does not impact our cash flow from operating activities 
see equity based compensation discussion included in note summary of significant accounting policies and note transactions with affiliates of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
gas gathering agreements 
for periods ending prior to january   our consolidated financial statements reflect the gathering fees we historically charged anadarko under our affiliate cost of service based arrangements with respect to the initial assets 
under these arrangements  we recovered  on an annual basis  our operation and maintenance  general and administrative and depreciation expenses in addition to earning a return on our invested capital 
effective january   we entered into new year gas gathering agreements with anadarko with respect to the initial assets 
pursuant to the terms of the new agreements  our fees for gathering and treating services rendered to anadarko increased 
this 
table of contents increase was due  in part  to compensate us for additional operation and maintenance expense that we incur as a result of us bearing all of the cost of employee benefits specifically identified and related to operational personnel working on our assets  as compared to bearing only those employee benefit costs reasonably allocated by anadarko to us for the periods ending prior to january  because our new gas gathering agreements are designed to fully recover these incremental costs  our revenues increased by an amount approximately equal to the incremental operation and maintenance expense 
although this change in methodology for computing affiliate gathering rates does not impact our net cash flows or net income  this methodology change impacts the components thereof as compared to periods ending prior to january  if we applied the methodology employed under our new gas gathering agreements with anadarko to the year ended december   we estimate our historic gathering revenues and operation and maintenance expense would have increased by million and our cash flow from operations would have remained unchanged 
the year gas gathering agreements entered into with anadarko with respect to the initial assets included new fees for gathering and treating 
the new fees are based on capital improvements and changes in our cost of service analysis and are higher than those fees reflected in our historical financial results for the periods ended prior to january  granger acquisition 
in january  we acquired the following assets from anadarko i the granger gathering system with related compressors and other facilities  and ii the granger complex  consisting of two cryogenic trains  two refrigeration trains  an ngls fractionation facility  and ancillary equipment 
beginning with our quarterly report for the first quarter of  we will recast our historic financial statements to include the granger assets from august  when anadarko acquired the assets in connection with its acquisition of western 
the acquisition will impact the comparability of our historic financial statements presented herein to our future financial statements 
see note subsequent events granger acquisition of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report 
general trends and outlook we expect our business to continue to be affected by the following key trends 
our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us 
to the extent our underlying assumptions about  or interpretations of  available information prove to be incorrect  our actual results may vary materially from our expectations 
impact of natural gas prices 
the recent natural gas price environment has resulted in lower drilling activity  resulting in fewer new well connections and  in some cases  temporary curtailments of production throughout areas in which we operate 
a continued low gas price environment may result in further reductions in drilling activity or temporary curtailments of production 
we have no control over this activity 
in addition  the recent or further decline in commodity prices could affect production rates and the level of capital invested by anadarko and third parties in the exploration for and development of new natural gas reserves 
to the extent opportunities are available  we will continue to connect new wells to our systems to mitigate the impact of natural production declines in order to maintain throughput on our systems 
however  our success in connecting new wells to our systems is dependent on activities of natural gas producers and shippers 
access to capital markets 
we require periodic access to capital in order to fund acquisitions and expansion projects 
under the terms of our partnership agreement  we are required to distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders  which makes us dependent upon raising capital to fund growth projects 
historically  master limited partnerships have accessed the public debt and equity capital markets to raise money for new growth projects and acquisitions 
recent market turbulence has from time to time either raised the cost of those public funds or  in some cases  eliminated the availability of these funds to prospective issuers 
if we are unable either to access the public capital markets or find alternative sources of capital  our growth strategy may be more challenging to execute 
impact of interest rates 
interest rates have been volatile in recent periods 
if interest rates rise  our future financing costs could increase accordingly 
in addition  because our common units are yield based securities  rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of our common units to 
table of contents investors  which could limit our ability to raise funds  or increase the cost of raising funds in the capital markets 
though our competitors may face similar circumstances  such an environment could adversely impact our efforts to expand our operations or make future acquisitions 
rising operating costs and inflation 
the high level of natural gas exploration  development and production activities across the us in recent years  and the associated construction of required midstream infrastructure  resulted in an increase in the competition for and cost of personnel and equipment 
as a result of the recent decline in commodity prices  we have and will continue to actively work with our suppliers to negotiate cost savings on services and equipment to more accurately reflect the current industry environment 
to the extent we are unable to negotiate lower costs  or recover higher costs through escalation provisions provided for in our contracts  our operating results will be adversely impacted 
acquisition opportunities 
as of december   anadarko s total domestic midstream asset portfolio  excluding assets we own  consisted of gathering systems with an aggregate throughput of approximately bcf d  and processing and or treating facilities 
a key component of our growth strategy is to acquire midstream assets from anadarko and third parties over time 
in december  we acquired the powder river assets from anadarko  in july  we acquired the chipeta assets from anadarko and in january  we acquired the granger assets from anadarko 
as of december   anadarko owns a general partner interest in us  all of our idrs and a limited partner interest in us 
given anadarko s significant interests in us  we believe anadarko will benefit from selling additional assets to us over time  however  anadarko continually evaluates acquisitions and divestitures and may elect to acquire  construct or dispose of midstream assets in the future without offering us the opportunity to acquire or construct those assets 
should anadarko choose to pursue additional midstream asset sales  it is under no contractual obligation to offer assets or business opportunities to us 
we may also pursue certain asset acquisitions from third parties to the extent such acquisitions complement our or anadarko s existing asset base or allow us to capture operational efficiencies from anadarko s or third party production 
however  if we do not make additional acquisitions from anadarko or third parties on economically acceptable terms  our future growth will be limited  and the acquisitions we make could reduce  rather than increase  our cash generated from operations on a per unit basis

the decrease for both the year ended december  and is primarily comprised of throughput decreases at the pinnacle  dew  haley and hugoton systems due to natural production declines and changes in contract terms  partially offset by affiliate throughput increases at the migc system 
contract terms for one pinnacle customer changed in august when a producer chose to take its product in kind and contract directly with us for gathering services  rather than to sell its production to our affiliate at the wellhead  resulting in a shift in volumes from affiliate to third party 
affiliate volume increases for the migc system are primarily due to throughput from contracts entered into by our affiliate upon expiration of two third party contracts in december and january  which enabled an affiliate of anadarko to increase its volumes  and a new affiliate contract that became effective in september in connection with expansion of the system s capacity 
third party gathering and transportation throughput decreased by mmcf d for the year ended december  and increased by mmcf d for the year ended december  the decrease for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to throughput decreases at the migc system  partially offset by third party throughput increases at the haley and pinnacle systems 
the declines experienced on the migc pipeline were primarily due to the expiration of two third party contracts described above 
the throughput increases on the haley system were primarily due to third party drilling activity which partially offset natural production declines 
the increase in third party throughput at the pinnacle system is primarily due to changes in contract terms mentioned above resulting in a shift from affiliate to third party throughput 
the increase for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to throughput increases at the hugoton and haley systems primarily from third party drilling activity  partially offset by third party throughput decreases at the pinnacle system resulting primarily from natural production declines 
affiliate processing throughput increased by mmcf d and mmcf d for the year ended december  and for the year ended december   respectively  and third party processing throughput increased by mmcf d and by mmcf d for the year ended december  and for the year ended december   respectively 
affiliate throughput increased primarily due to increased throughput at the chipeta plant from initial start up of the plant in early and the addition of the cryogenic train in april  driven by our affiliates drilling activities in the natural buttes area 
equity investment volumes increased by mmcf d and by mmcf d for the year ended december  and for the year ended december   respectively  primarily due to additional throughput from the powder river area following expansion of the fort union system during the second half of

the value of natural gas volumes that are purchased by us to return to producers under keep whole arrangements are recorded as cost of product expense 
the increase in the volumes of ngls purchased  excluding the impact of the plant suspension  and the increase in the volumes of natural gas purchased are primarily due to the increase in throughput at the chipeta plant for the year ended december  as well as increased ngl recoveries at the chipeta plant due to completion of the cryogenic unit in april cost of product expense for the year ended december  increased by million  million of which was attributable to the higher cost of natural gas and ngls we purchased from producers  primarily due to higher market prices 
in addition  cost of product expense increased million due to a change in imbalance positions and related gas prices and increased million due to an unfavorable change in the difference between actual versus contractual fuel recoveries 
the volume of natural gas purchased from producers remained relatively flat and the volume of ngls purchased from producers decreased for the year ended december  the decrease in the volume of ngls purchased is primarily due to the september suspension of operations of a plant at the hilight system

this increase in the volumes of ngls purchased  excluding the impact of the plant suspension  is primarily due to the increase in throughput at the chipeta plant which was placed in service in december operation and maintenance expense decreased by million for the year ended december  and increased by million for the year ended december  the decrease for the year ended december  is primarily due to a million decrease in operating fuel costs attributable to the plant suspension at the hilight system in september  a million decrease in compressor parts and rental expenses primarily due to the contribution of previously leased compression equipment to us in november  and lower rates on equipment rentals as a result of renegotiating with suppliers  partially offset by a million increase in operating expenses at the chipeta plant 
operation and maintenance expense increased by million for the year ended december  primarily due to a million increase in labor and employee related expenses primarily attributable to being charged by anadarko for the full cost of these expenses 
specifically  contract modifications  beginning in  entitled anadarko to charge us additional labor and employee related expenses in order for us to bear the full cost of operational personnel working our assets instead of bearing only those employee benefit costs reasonably allocated by anadarko to us 
these additional costs were taken into account when setting the gathering rates in our affiliate based contracts for our initial assets that became effective in january  thus  our revenues increased by the same amount 
in addition  other increases in labor and employee related expenses for the year ended december  were due to increases in benefits and incentive programs 
operating expenses also increased by million due to operating expenses attributable to the chipeta plant  partially offset by a million decrease in compressor rental expenses

the increase in net 
table of contents income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december  is primarily due to higher throughput at the chipeta plant  partially offset by lower ngl prices 
the increase for the year ended december  is primarily due to an increase in volumes processed at the chipeta plant as the refrigeration unit was placed in service in late and throughput increased to the plant s initial capacity during the first quarter of the cryogenic unit was placed in service in april  leading to further increased volumes and ngl recoveries during the balance of liquidity and capital resources our ability to finance operations  fund maintenance capital expenditures and pay distributions will largely depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to cover these requirements 
our ability to generate cash flow is subject to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
please read item a of this annual report 
prior to our initial public offering  our sources of liquidity included cash generated from operations and funding from anadarko 
furthermore  we participated in anadarko s cash management program  whereby anadarko  on a periodic basis  swept cash balances residing in our bank accounts 
thus  our historical consolidated financial statements for periods ending prior to our initial public offering reflect no significant cash balances 
unlike our transactions with third parties  which ultimately are settled in cash  our affiliate transactions prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets were settled on a net basis through an adjustment to parent net investment 
subsequent to our initial public offering  we maintain our own bank accounts and sources of liquidity 
although we continue to utilize anadarko s cash management system  our cash accounts are not subject to cash sweeps by anadarko 
our sources of liquidity as of december  include approximately million of working capital  which we define as the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities  cash generated from operations  available borrowings under our million revolving credit facility  which is expandable to million  available borrowings of up to million under anadarko s billion credit facility  available borrowings under our million working capital facility with anadarko  interest income from our million note receivable from anadarko  and potential issuances of additional partnership securities 
we believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to satisfy our short term working capital requirements and long term maintenance capital expenditure requirements 
the amount of future distributions to unitholders will depend on earnings  financial conditions  capital requirements and other factors  and will be determined by the board of directors of our general partner on a quarterly basis 
on january   we borrowed million under our million revolving credit facility in connection with the granger acquisition 
see note subsequent events granger acquisition of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report 
working capital 
working capital  defined as the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities  is an indication of our liquidity and potential need for short term funding 
our working capital requirements are driven by changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable 
these changes are primarily impacted by factors such as credit extended to  and the timing of collections from  our customers and the level and timing of our spending for maintenance and expansion activity

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million and increased by million for the year ended december  and for the year ended december   respectively 
for the year ended december   the decrease is primarily attributable to changes in working capital  lower throughput and gross margins  and higher general and administrative expenses as described in results of operations overview above 
in addition  these items were partially offset by lower current income taxes  and lower operations and maintenance expenses 
for the year ended december   the increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to gathering rate increases  increased condensate margins  revenues attributable to changes in gas imbalance positions and gas prices as well as increased net interest income  partially offset by higher cash operating expenses

capital requirements 
our business can be capital intensive  requiring significant investment to maintain and improve existing facilities 
we categorize capital expenditures as either maintenance capital expenditures  which include those expenditures required to maintain the existing operating capacity and service capability of our assets  including the replacement of system components and equipment that have suffered significant wear and tear  become obsolete or approached the end of their useful lives  those expenditures necessary to remain in compliance with regulatory or legal requirements or those expenditures necessary to complete additional well connections to maintain existing system volumes and related cash flows  or expansion capital expenditures  which include those expenditures incurred in order to extend the useful lives of our assets  reduce costs  increase revenues or increase gathering  processing  treating and

table of contents on october   we used million of our capacity under the revolving credit facility along with million of cash on hand to refinance our million  fixed rate  three year term loan and settle related accrued interest 
we entered into the three year term loan agreement with anadarko in july to finance a portion of the chipeta acquisition 
in december  we repaid the amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility using a portion of the proceeds from the equity offering 
in january  we borrowed million under the revolving credit facility to partially fund the granger acquisition 
anadarko s credit facility 
on march   anadarko entered into a billion credit facility under which we are a co borrower 
this credit facility is available for borrowings and letters of credit and permits us to utilize up to million under the facility for general partnership purposes  including acquisitions  but only to the extent that sufficient amounts remain unborrowed by anadarko 
at december   the full million was available for borrowing by us 
the billion credit facility expires in march interest on borrowings under the credit facility is calculated based on the election by the borrower of either i a floating rate equal to the federal funds effective rate plus or ii a periodic fixed rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin  which was at december   and the commitment fees on the facility are based on anadarko s senior unsecured long term debt rating 
pursuant to the omnibus agreement  as a co borrower under anadarko s credit facility  we are required to reimburse anadarko for our allocable portion of commitment fees of our committed and available borrowing capacity  including our outstanding balances  if any that anadarko incurs under its credit facility  or up to million annually 
under certain of anadarko s credit and lease agreements  we and anadarko are required to comply with certain covenants  including a financial covenant that requires anadarko to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of or less 
as of december   we and anadarko were in compliance with all covenants 
should we or anadarko fail to comply with any covenant in anadarko s credit facilities  we may not be permitted to borrow thereunder 
anadarko is a guarantor of our borrowings  if any  under the credit facility 
we are not a guarantor of anadarko s borrowings under the credit facility 
working capital facility 
concurrent with the closing of our initial public offering  we entered into a two year  million working capital facility with anadarko as the lender 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding under the working capital facility 
the facility is available exclusively to fund working capital needs 
borrowings under the facility will bear interest at the same rate as would apply to borrowings under the anadarko credit facility described above 
we pay a commitment fee of annually to anadarko on the unused portion of the working capital facility  or up to  annually 
we are required to reduce all borrowings under our working capital facility to zero for a period of at least consecutive days at least once during each of the twelve month periods prior to the maturity date of the facility 
credit risk 
we bear credit risk represented by our exposure to non payment or non performance by our customers  including anadarko 
generally  non payment or non performance results from a customer s inability to satisfy receivables for services rendered or volumes owed pursuant to gas imbalance agreements 
we examine and monitor the creditworthiness of third party customers and may establish credit limits for significant third party customers 
we are dependent upon a single producer  anadarko  for the majority of our natural gas volumes and we do not maintain a credit limit with respect to anadarko 
consequently  we are subject to the risk of non payment or late payment by anadarko for gathering  treating and transmission fees and for proceeds from the sale of natural gas  ngls and condensate to anadarko 
we expect our exposure to concentrated risk of non payment or non performance to continue for as long as we remain substantially dependent on anadarko for our revenues 
additionally  we are exposed to credit risk on the note receivable from anadarko that was issued concurrent with the closing of our initial public offering 
we are also party to an omnibus agreement with anadarko under which anadarko is required to indemnify us for certain environmental claims  losses arising from rights of way claims  failures to obtain required consents or governmental permits and income taxes with respect to the initial assets 
finally  we entered into commodity price swap agreements with anadarko in order to substantially reduce our exposure to 
table of contents commodity price risk attributable to our percent of proceeds and keep whole contracts for the hilight system and the newcastle system and are subject to performance risk thereunder 
if anadarko becomes unable to perform under the terms of our gathering  processing and transportation agreements  natural gas and ngl purchase agreements  its note payable to us  the omnibus agreement  the services and secondment agreement or the commodity price swap agreements  our ability to make distributions to our unitholders may be adversely impacted 
contractual obligations following is a summary of our obligations as of december  asset note payable office retirement to anadarko credit lease obligations principal interest facility fees total in thousands thereafter total office lease anadarko leases office space used exclusively by us and charges rental payments to us 
the amounts above represent the future minimum rent payments due under the office lease 
asset retirement obligations when assets are acquired or constructed  the initial estimated asset retirement obligation is recognized in an amount equal to the net present value of the settlement obligation  with an associated increase in properties and equipment 
the asset retirement obligation amounts above are discounted 
revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations can result from revisions to estimated inflation rates and discount rates  escalating retirement costs and changes in the estimated timing of settlement 
for additional information see note asset retirement obligations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report 
note payable to anadarko in connection with the powder river acquisition  we entered into a five year  million term loan agreement with anadarko which calls for interest at a fixed rate of for the first two years and a floating rate of interest at three month libor plus basis points for the final three years 
credit facility fees we are required to pay facility fees on our million revolving credit facility  on our million portion of anadarko s billion credit facility and on our million working capital facility as described under the caption historical cash flow above within this item also see the caption items affecting the comparability of our financial results under item of this annual report for a discussion of contractual obligations effective with the initial public offering or powder river acquisition  including the omnibus agreement  expenses related to operating as a publicly traded partnership  the services and secondment agreement and equity based compensation plans 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make informed judgments and estimates that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods reported 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including those related to the determination of 
table of contents properties and equipment  goodwill  asset retirement obligations  litigation  environmental liabilities  income taxes and fair values 
although these estimates are based on management s best available knowledge of current and expected future events  changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates 
management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and discusses the selection and development of these estimates with the audit committee of our general partner 
for additional information concerning our accounting policies  see the note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
depreciation 
depreciation expense is generally computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets 
determination of depreciation expense requires judgment regarding the estimated useful lives and salvage values of property  plant and equipment 
as circumstances warrant  depreciation estimates are reviewed to determine if any changes in the underlying assumptions are necessary 
the weighted average life of our long lived assets is approximately years 
if the depreciable lives of our assets were reduced by  we estimate that annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million  which would result in a corresponding reduction in our operating income 
impairment of tangible assets 
each reporting period  management assesses whether facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of property  plant and equipment may not be recoverable from expected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is not expected to be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment may be recognized 
any impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value 
in assessing long lived assets for impairment  management evaluates changes in our business and economic conditions and their implications for recoverability of the assets carrying amounts 
since a significant portion of our revenues arises from gathering and transporting natural gas production from anadarko operated properties  significant downward revisions in reserve estimates or changes in future development plans by anadarko  to the extent they affect our operations  may necessitate assessment of the carrying amount of our affected assets for recoverability 
such assessment requires application of judgment regarding the use and ultimate disposition of the asset  long range revenue and expense estimates  global and regional economic conditions  including commodity prices and drilling activity by our customers  as well as other factors affecting estimated future net cash flows 
the measure of impairment to be recognized  if any  depends upon management s estimate of the asset s fair value  which may be determined based on the estimates of future net cash flows or values at which similar assets were transferred in the market in recent transactions  if such data is available 
impairment of goodwill 
we evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired annually as of october  unless facts and circumstances make it necessary to test more frequently 
management has determined that we have one operating segment and two reporting units i gathering and processing and transportation 
the carrying value of goodwill as of december  was million and million for the gathering and processing reporting unit and transportation reporting unit  respectively 
accounting standards require that goodwill be assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level 
goodwill impairment assessment is a two step process 
step one focuses on identifying a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  no further action is required 
however  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is written down to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to operating expense based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation 
because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available  management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test 
management uses information available to make these fair value estimates  including market multiples of adjusted ebitda 
specifically  management estimates fair value by applying an estimated multiple to projected adjusted ebitda 
management considered the relatively few observable transactions in the market  as well as trading multiples for peers  to determine an appropriate multiple to apply against our 
table of contents projected adjusted ebitda 
a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of our reporting units could result in a goodwill impairment 
factors that could trigger a lower fair value estimate include sustained price declines  cost increases  regulatory or political environment changes  and other changes in market conditions such as decreased prices in market based transactions for similar assets 
based on our most recent goodwill impairment test  we concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit 
therefore  no goodwill impairment was indicated and no goodwill impairment has been recognized in these consolidated financial statements 
fair value 
management estimates fair value in performing impairment tests for long lived assets and goodwill as well as for the initial measurement of asset retirement obligations 
when management is required to measure fair value  and there is not a market observable price for the asset or liability  or a market observable price for a similar asset or liability  management generally utilizes an income or multiples valuation approach 
the income approach utilizes management s best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows  and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk adjusted discount rate 
such evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment  since the results are based on expected future events or conditions  such as sales prices  estimates of future throughput  capital and operating costs and the timing thereof  economic and regulatory climates and other factors 
a multiples approach utilizes management s best assumptions regarding expectations of projected ebitda and multiple of that ebitda that a buyer would pay to acquire an asset 
management s estimates of future net cash flows and ebitda are inherently imprecise because they reflect management s expectation of future conditions that are often outside of management s control 
however  assumptions used reflect a market participant s view of long term prices  costs and other factors  and are consistent with assumptions used in our business plans and investment decisions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
we bear a limited degree of commodity price risk with respect to certain of our gathering and processing contracts 
pursuant to certain of our contracts  we retain and sell drip condensate that is recovered during the gathering of natural gas 
as part of this arrangement  we are required to provide a thermally equivalent volume of natural gas or the cash equivalent thereof to the shipper 
thus  our revenues for this portion of our contractual arrangement are based on the price received for the drip condensate and our costs for this portion of our contractual arrangement depend on the price of natural gas 
historically  drip condensate sells at a price representing a discount to the price of nymex west texas intermediate crude oil 
in addition  certain of our processing services are provided under percent of proceeds and keep whole agreements in which anadarko is typically responsible for the marketing of the natural gas and ngls 
under percent of proceeds agreements  we receive a specified percentage of the net proceeds from the sale of natural gas and ngls 
under keep whole agreements  we keep of the ngls produced  and the processed natural gas  or value of the gas  is returned to the producer 
since some of the gas is used and removed during processing  we compensate the producer for the amount of gas used and removed in processing by supplying additional gas or by paying an agreed upon value for the gas utilized 
to mitigate our exposure to changes in 
table of contents commodity prices on these types of processing agreements  we entered into commodity price swap agreements with anadarko with fixed commodity prices that extend through december   with an option to extend through in addition  to mitigate our exposure to changes in commodity prices on these types of processing agreements on the granger assets we acquired in january  we entered into commodity price swap agreements with anadarko with fixed commodity prices that extend through for additional information on the commodity price swap agreements  see note transactions with affiliates and note subsequent events granger acquisition included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report we consider our exposure to commodity price risk associated with the above described arrangements to be minimal given the relatively small amount of our operating income generated by drip condensate sales and the existence of the commodity price swap agreements with anadarko 
for the year ended december   a change in the margin between drip condensate and natural gas would have resulted in an approximate million  or less than  change in operating income for the period 
we also bear a limited degree of commodity price risk with respect to settlement of our natural gas imbalances that arise from differences in gas volumes received into our systems and gas volumes delivered by us to customers 
natural gas volumes owed to or by us that are subject to monthly cash settlement are valued according to the terms of the contract as of the balance sheet dates  and generally reflect market index prices 
other natural gas volumes owed to or by us are valued at our weighted average cost of natural gas as of the balance sheet dates and are settled in kind 
our exposure to the impact of changes in commodity prices on outstanding imbalances depends on the timing of settlement of the imbalances 
interest rate risk 
if interest rates rise  our future financing costs will increase 
interest rates during and were low compared to historic rates 
as of december   we had million of credit available under our revolving credit facility  million of credit available for borrowing under anadarko s five year credit facility in addition to million available under our two year working capital facility with anadarko 
on january   we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility in connection with the granger acquisition 
our borrowings  if any  under our revolving credit facility  anadarko s credit facility or our working capital facility bear interest at variable rates 
in addition  as of december   we owed million to anadarko under our five year term loan we entered into in connection with the powder river acquisition which bears interest at a fixed rate of until december and at a floating rate thereafter 
see note debt and interest expense of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we may incur additional debt in the future  either under the revolving credit facility  our million borrowing capacity under anadarko s existing credit facility  our million working capital facility with anadarko or other financing sources  including commercial bank borrowings or debt issuances
