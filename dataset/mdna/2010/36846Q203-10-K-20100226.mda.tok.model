com web site 
the strategy for our media business is to increase our awareness  improve our sites and capture  analyze and draw insights from our data 
we are investing in awareness by targeting the media community  who are the primary buyers for our advertising services 
we believe this investment will improve our brand recognition in the marketing and advertising communities 
we are also investing in our web properties  primarily sourceforge 
net where we launched a more modern platform in july we currently use the following key metrics which are derived from data provided by google analytics to measure our media business year ended five months ended december  july  december  unique visitors per month in thousands visits per unique visitor per month visits per month in thousands pages per visit page views per month in thousands revenue per thousand pages rpm revenue per user rpu unique visitors per month is the aggregate average unique visitors for all our media sites during the period presented 
this does not consider possible duplicate visitors who may visit more than one of our web sites during the month 
per month amounts are the average calculated as the total amount for the period divided by the months in the period 
revenue per user rpu is an annualized amount based on revenue and unique users during the period presented 
a key element of our growth plans is to increase engagement 
our metrics around engagement per user are an important measure  and we are focused on both growing the number of unique visitors and deepening the average levels of engagement 
media companies have historically reported page views as a metric seeking to measure users level of engagement 
since the introduction of a new web technology  known as asynchronous javascript and xml ajax which allows users to browse web sites without loading a new page  page views have generally declined for the same  or even higher  level of activity 
we have begun to implement this technology  and as we increase our adoption and change our sites to continue to make them easier to use and more accessible  we may experience associated fluctuations in page views 
as the measures of engagement utilized by media companies evolve to include elements such as time spent per visit or number of visits per month in addition to or in lieu of page views  we expect that our reported metrics may also evolve 
in addition  as we modernize and insert more intelligence into our web properties to enhance the user experience  we remove pages from the user flow which decreases page views 
our e commerce business strategy is to increase revenue by expanding the range of new and innovative products we sell  including products developed by us  and by attracting increased traffic to our site 
we attract traffic to our sites using a variety of traditional online and direct retail marketing channels  direct mail and email to our customers and followers 
we also communicate with our customers through social networks such as facebook and twitter 
in addition  we launched a site redesign on thinkgeek s year anniversary in august sales for both of our operating segments continue to be primarily attributable to customers located in the united states of america 
critical accounting policies accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the assessment of impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  restructuring reserves for excess facilities for non cancelable leases  income taxes  stock based compensation and contingencies and litigation 
revenue recognition media revenue media revenue is primarily derived from sales of advertising on our various web properties 
we recognize media revenue as advertising is delivered over the period in which the advertisements are displayed  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  no significant obligations remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
e commerce revenue e commerce revenue is derived from the online sale of consumer goods 
we recognize e commerce revenue from the sale of consumer goods when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in general  the company recognizes e commerce revenue when products are shipped and title transfers to the customer 
we grant customers a day right to return products and we have recorded returns reserves of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the long lived assets in measuring whether they are recoverable 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  a loss is recorded as the excess of the asset s carrying value over fair value 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our annual testing date is december impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying net assets  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the income  or discounted cash flows  approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered to be impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
the preparation of the goodwill impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the determination of fair values of reporting units and tangible and intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions  which include future values  are often subjective and may differ significantly from period to period based on changes in the overall economic environment  changes in our business and changes in our strategy or our internal forecasts 
we utilize independent valuation experts to assess the reasonableness of our assumptions and to perform certain portions of our goodwill impairment analysis 
restructuring costs in october  we relocated our corporate headquarters to mountain view  california 
during our fiscal year ended july   we recorded a restructuring charge of million for the remaining facility space and leasehold improvements at our former corporate headquarters located in fremont  california 
in conjunction with the sale of our software business in april  we accrued a restructuring charge of million for the excess facility space used in the operation of our software business  which was included in the gain on disposal of discontinued operations 
in fiscal and  we adopted plans to exit our hardware systems and hardware related software engineering and professional services businesses  as well as exit a sublease agreement and to reduce our general and administrative overhead costs 
we have a restructuring liability of million as of december  which represents the remaining accrual from non cancelable lease payments  less estimated sublease rent  for our former corporate headquarters in fremont  california 
these lease payments continue through may stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize the expense net of estimated forfeitures for those shares expected to vest over the service period of the award 
calculating compensation expense requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the option grant  stock price volatility  and the pre vesting option forfeiture rate 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise patterns 
we estimate stock price volatility based on historical implied volatility in our stock 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock based awards that are granted  exercised  or cancelled 
contingencies and litigation we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of any loss contingency required is assessed and recorded  if probable  after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required loss contingencies may change in the future as the facts and circumstances of each matter change 
results of operations the following table sets forth our operating results for the periods indicated as a percentage of net revenue  represented by selected items from the consolidated statements of operations 
this table should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this form k

for the year ended december   the five months ended december  and the years ended july  and july   no one customer represented or greater of net revenue 
we do not anticipate that any one customer will represent more than of future annual net revenue 
media revenue year ended five months ended change change change december  july  december  year to fiscal five months fiscal to to in thousands unaudited direct sales ad networks other media revenue media revenue is derived primarily from advertising products delivered on our web properties 
direct sales revenue is generated from orders received by our united states based sales team  which may also include advertisements to be delivered globally  ad networks revenue represents revenue from our ad network partners who sell our inventory globally to customers through automated systems and includes revenue from international resellers who use automated systems  and other represents orders received from our international resellers and to a lesser extent sales of data and referral fees 
direct sales revenue for the year ended december  decreased million as compared with the year ended july  the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in revenue from advertisers whose campaigns were not renewed or who chose to advertise at lower levels during the year ended december   offset in part by increases in revenue of million from customers who did not advertise in the year ended july  and million from customers who increased their advertising levels during the year ended december  as compared with the year ended july  the increase in ad networks revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended july  was due to increased revenue from google primarily due to optimization of our web sites to increase yields from google 
since we obtain higher prices for direct sales revenue  we allocate our available ad units first to direct sales campaigns and then to ad networks 
to the extent that direct sales campaigns decline  we would allocate additional ad units to ad networks  which would increase revenue from ad networks 
the decrease in other revenue during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended july  was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from our international resellers 
direct sales revenue for the year ended july  increased million as compared with the year ended july  the increase was primarily due to increases in revenue of million from customers who did not advertise in the year ended july  and million from customers who increased their advertising levels during the year ended july  as compared with the year ended july   offset in part by a million decrease in revenue from advertisers whose campaigns were not renewed or who chose to advertise at lower levels during the year ended july  the increase in ad networks revenue for the year ended july  as compared to the year ended july  was primarily due to increased revenue from google 
other revenue remained essentially flat for the year ended july  as compared to the year ended july  direct sales revenue for the five months ended december  decreased million as compared with the five months ended december  the decrease was primarily due to decreases of million in revenue from advertisers whose campaigns were not renewed or who chose not to advertise during the five months ended december   offset in part by an increase of million from advertisers who advertised more or who did not participate in campaigns during the five months ended december  the increase in ad networks revenue for the five months ended december  as compared to the five months ended december  was due to increased revenue from google as a result of optimization of our web sites to increase yields from our google programs 
the increase in other for the five months ended december  as compared to the five months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in revenue generated by our united kingdom s reseller and to a lesser extent to revenue from other resellers 
we believe that our audience of technology professionals and technology enthusiasts who rely on our web properties  along with our favorable online visitor demographics  makes us an attractive advertising vehicle 
we expect our media revenue to increase in the future as we continue to develop new products which appeal to advertisers and optimize our web properties to increase monetization of ad network and international traffic 
e commerce revenue year ended five months ended change change change december  july  december  year to fiscal five months fiscal to to unaudited revenue in thousands percentage of total net revenue number of orders shipped average order size in dollars e commerce revenue is derived from the online sale of consumer goods  including shipping  net of any returns and allowances 
the growth in e commerce revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended july  was primarily due to increased consumer awareness of our web site as a result of broader product offerings  increasing in the number of invented at thinkgeek products such as the electronic rock guitar shirt and the tauntaun sleeping bag  online marketing  print catalogs and media coverage of our web site 
this increased awareness of our site attracted a larger customer base  which drove a increase in the number of unique visitors to our web site  resulting in a increase in the number of orders shipped 
the increase in orders shipped was partially offset by a decrease in the average order size during the year ended december  as compared to the prior fiscal year ended july  due to the mix of products with lower selling prices 
the growth in e commerce revenue for the year ended july  as compared to the year ended july  was primarily due to increased consumer awareness of our web site as a result of broader product offerings  an increase in the number of custom developed products such as the wi fi detector shirt and the bit tie  catalog marketing and media coverage of our web site which attracted a larger customer base 
this larger customer base as well as web site enhancements  including improved search capability and customer communication features  drove a increase in the number of unique visitors to our web site 
this increase in unique visitors resulted in a increase in the number of orders shipped during the fiscal year ended july  the average order size increased by in the fiscal year ended july  when compared to the prior fiscal year 
the growth in e commerce revenue during the five months ended december   as compared to the five months ended december   was primarily due to a increase in the number of shipments year over year  offset in part by an decrease in the average value of those shipments 
the increase in the number of shipments was primarily driven by demand for new products  including thinkgeek s newly released products such as the electronic drum kit and the personal soundtrack shirt 
the decrease in average shipment value was due to a combination of lower price points of the mix of products purchased  lower shipping revenue per order as customers took advantage of our free shipping promotions and a general decrease in shipping fees charged to customers 
we expect e commerce revenue to continue to grow as we increase the number of orders received by visitors to our site

our e commerce business has significantly lower gross margins than our media business 
our e commerce revenue increased to of total net revenue for the year ended december   from of net revenue for the year ended july  the decrease in gross margin percentage in the year ended july  as compared to the year ended july  was primarily due to our business unit mix as well as to a decrease in our media gross margin percentage  resulting from the significant increase in media cost of revenue 
gross margin percentage decreased for the five months ended december  as compared with the five months ended december   due to the decrease in our e commerce and media gross margin percentages  which are discussed further in the next section 
cost of revenue gross margin by segment media cost of revenue gross margin year ended five months ended change change change december  july  december  year to fiscal to five months fiscal to in thousands unaudited media cost of revenue media gross margin media gross margin headcount media cost of revenue consists of personnel and related overhead  equipment and bandwidth associated with the operation of our data center  personnel costs and related overhead associated with developing the editorial content of our sites and personnel and related overhead and third party costs associated with delivering revenue producing products 
media cost of revenue includes both costs which do not vary directly with revenue fixed costs  such as equipment  personnel and editorial costs  as well as costs which are more directly affected by revenue variable costs  such as bandwidth for delivering content and ad serving costs 
while our fixed costs will generally not vary directly with revenue  they may increase to the extent that we expand or upgrade the equipment necessary to operate our network or if we add additional sites to our network of web sites 
our variable costs generally vary based on the delivery of web pages  content  the number of advertisements delivered and the size of the advertisement 
to the extent that we are able to increase our revenue without increasing our fixed costs  our gross margins will increase  however  to the extent that we expand our equipment in anticipation of increased activity  we may experience decreased gross margins 
the decrease in media gross margin percentage for the year ended december  as compared to the fiscal year ended july  was primarily due to a decrease in media revenue of million  offset slightly by lower cost of revenue of million 
the decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to decreases in co location costs of million  headcount and related costs of million  and ad serving costs of million  offset in part by an increase in depreciation and amortization of equipment and software of million 
our co location costs decreased primarily due to savings resulting from the closure of our data center in santa clara  california  upon completion of our relocation to the new data center near chicago  illinois 
our headcount and related costs decreased primarily due a reduction in our ad operations group in the early part of and our ad serving costs decrease is primarily due to our site redesign  which eliminated a significant number of advertising impressions from our pages 
our depreciation and amortization costs increased due to equipment and related software purchased for our data center and amortization of internally developed software 
the decrease in media gross margin percentage for the fiscal year ended july  as compared to the fiscal year ended july  was primarily due to the higher cost of revenue of million 
the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to increases in data center co location costs of million  amortization of equipment and software of million  headcount and related overhead costs of million  and ad serving costs of million 
our data center costs increased due to the relocation of our santa clara  california data center to a new larger data center near chicago  illinois 
our depreciation and amortization costs increased due to equipment and related software purchased for our data center and amortization of internally developed software 
headcount and related costs increased due to increased personnel  primarily related to our ad serving operations and the transfer of an executive to network operations 
our ad serving cost increase was primarily due to the implementation and adoption of technology which provides for the automation of customer quotes  approval of the resulting order and transfer of the order to our ad server 
the decrease in media gross margin percentages for the five months ended december   as compared to the five months ended december   was primarily driven by increases in depreciation and amortization expense of million  personnel related expenses of million and co location expenses of million 
depreciation and amortization expense increased due to depreciation of the equipment we purchased for our data center and amortization of internally developed software 
our personnel expenses increased as we added headcount to develop and serve our premium products  which require more effort to produce 
we expect media cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our ad operations to deliver products to our web properties 
to the extent that media revenue does not increase proportionately  our media gross margins may decline 
e commerce cost of revenue gross margin year ended five months ended change change change december  july  december  year to fiscal to five months fiscal to in thousands unaudited e commerce cost of revenue e commerce gross margin e commerce gross margin headcount e commerce cost of revenue consists of product costs  shipping and fulfillment costs and personnel and related overhead associated with the operations and merchandising functions 
e commerce gross margin percentage decreased in year ended december  as compared to year ended july  primarily due to our investment in our merchandising and operations teams 
e commerce cost of revenue in year ended december  increased as compared to year ended july  consistent with increased e commerce revenue levels  however  our operating costs increased as we added additional headcount to enhance our merchandising team and to support our expected revenue growth 
e commerce gross margin percentage decreased in year ended july  as compared to year ended july  due to shipping revenue comprising a higher percent as a result of increases in shipping costs 
we generate a significantly lower gross margin on shipping revenue than product revenue 
e commerce cost of revenue in year ended july  increased as compared to year ended july  consistent with increased e commerce revenue levels  however  increased shipping cost resulted in a slightly lower gross margin percentage 
the increase in e commerce cost of revenue in absolute dollars in year ended july  as compared to year ended july  was primarily due to increased product costs of million  shipping costs of million  fulfillment costs of million  and merchandising costs of million 
increases in product costs were the result of increased e commerce revenue levels  shipping costs were related to the increased volume of orders shipped as well as significant increases in shipping rates resulting from increased fuel prices  and the increase in fulfillment costs were related to increased number of orders processed and an increased range of product offerings 
the increase in e commerce cost of revenue during the five months ended december   as compared to five months ended december  was primarily due to increased product costs  shipping and fulfillment costs and operating costs 
these increases were primarily the result of an increase in the number of orders 
the decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to lower product gross margins resulting from sales of slower moving inventory at discounted margins and other incentives offered and increased operating expenses  primarily due to additional headcount and related costs to provide customer service and to identify and source new products and to a lesser extent to increases in shipping and fulfillment costs as a percentage of the reduced average order size 
we expect e commerce cost of revenue in absolute dollars to increase proportionately with e commerce revenue 
in addition  we expect e commerce overall gross margins will remain relatively constant 
we are also considering changing our third party contract fulfillment and warehouse provider 
if we change providers  we will incur significant costs and expenses 
if we do not generate sufficient revenue or sustain cost savings to offset these costs and expenses  our cost of revenue will increase and our gross margins will decline

year ended five months ended change change change december  july  december  year to fiscal to five months fiscal to in thousands unaudited sales and marketing percentage of total net revenue headcount the increase in absolute dollars spent on sales and marketing in year ended december  as compared to year ended july  was primarily due to increases in headcount and related expenses of million  marketing expenses of million and credit card fees of million 
the increase in headcount and related expense was due to additional personnel in our e commerce and media marketing organizations  offset in part by headcount reductions in our media sales organization  including severance costs of million related to the reduction of media sales and marketing personnel during the fourth quarter of the increase in discretionary marketing expenses was primarily due to increased e commerce marketing expenses of million  resulting from discretionary online and direct mail marketing  approximately million related to our name branding and the promotion of our geeknet brand and increased discretionary media marketing expenses of million  including events and trade show attendance 
the increase in absolute dollars spent on sales and marketing in year ended july  as compared to year ended july  was primarily due to increases in headcount and related expenses of million and marketing expenses of million 
the increase in headcount was due to additional personnel in our media sales and marketing organizations and the increase in headcount related expense was due to stock based compensation and travel expense for training and customer visits 
the increase in discretionary marketing expenses was primarily due to increased e commerce marketing expenses of million  resulting from the printing and mailing of our e commerce catalogs  fees paid to affiliates and consultants  which were offset in part by lower discretionary media marketing expenses of million 
the increase in s m expenses in the five months ended december   as compared to the five months ended december   was primarily due to increases in headcount and related expenses of million  marketing expenses of million and credit card fees of million 
the increase in headcount was primarily due to an increase in sales personnel 
the increase in marketing expenses was due to printing and mailing of our e commerce catalog and other discretionary marketing programs and the increase in credit card fees was due to an increase in our e commerce revenue 
we believe that our sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars will increase in the future as we increase our revenue  expand our marketing organization and marketing programs and expand our international media sales force 
we do not expect that sales and marketing expenses will change significantly as a percentage of revenue 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead expenses for software engineers involved in developing our media and e commerce web sites

no internal use software costs were capitalized for the year ended december  during the years ended july  and july   we capitalized million and million  respectively  of software development costs relating to the development of our sourceforge 
net marketplace platform 
the increase in r d expense in absolute dollars in the year ended december  compared to the year ended july  was due to increases in both our media and e commerce r d expenses 
the increase in media expense was primarily due to increased investment in personnel and related overhead expenses incurred to modernize our web sites and services  and the increase in e commerce expense was due to increased personnel who were hired to update and add additional functionality for our thinkgeek 
com web site 
in we began modernizing our sourceforge 
net and thinkgeek web sites 
the increase in r d expense in absolute dollars in year ended july  compared to year ended july  was primarily due to increases in both our media and e commerce r d expenses 
the increase in media expense was primarily due to increased personnel and related overhead expenses incurred to modernize our web sites and services  and the increase in e commerce expense was due to increased personnel who were hired to update and add additional functionality for our thinkgeek 
com web site 
r d expense increased by million in absolute dollars in the five months ended december   as compared to the five months ended december  media accounted for the majority of the increase including million due to increased headcount related costs 
additionally  during the five months ended december   certain development efforts of million qualified for capitalization as development phase costs related to internally developed software 
our e commerce r d expense increased due to increases in headcount to further develop the web sites and their capabilities 
we expect that r d expenses may decline slightly in absolute dollars and will also decline as a percentage of revenue in the future

our decrease in personnel related expenses were primarily due to decreases in stock based compensation expense of million and severance costs of million  related to the resignation of our former chief executive officer in the prior year 
the decrease in g a expense as a percentage of net revenue was also due to the decrease in g a expenses 
our decrease in legal related expenses was primarily due to the resolution of the okerman legal matter in the prior year 
our decrease in annual meeting expenses and increase in accounting and tax expenses resulted primarily from the change in our fiscal year to december the increase in g a expenses in absolute dollars in year ended july  as compared to year ended july  was primarily related to stock based compensation expense of million and increased severance costs of million  primarily related to the resignation of our former chief executive officer  legal fees of million  including million related to the resolution of the okerman legal matter  recruiting  advisor and board of director fees of million  and higher bad debt expenses of million resulting from increased revenue levels  and g a expenses of million which were allocated to our discontinued software business in  partially offset by a decrease in accounting fees of million 
the increase in g a expense as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to the significant increase in g a expenses 
general and administrative expenses did not change significantly during the five months ended december  as compared to the five months ended december  during the five months ended december   increases in recruiting expenses of million were offset by reductions in bad debt expenses of million and facilities related expenses of million 
the increase in recruiting expenses was due to recruiting fees for our new chief executive officer and the decrease in facilities fees is due to expenses related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters incurred during the five months ended december we do not expect g a expenses to change significantly from levels in absolute dollars  and we also expect g a expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the future 
restructuring costs in october  we relocated our corporate headquarters to mountain view  california 
during fiscal year  which ended on july  under our prior fiscal calendar  we recorded a restructuring charge of million for the remaining facility space and leasehold improvements at our former corporate headquarters located in fremont  california 
in conjunction with the sale of our software business in april  we accrued a restructuring charge of million for the excess facility space used in the operation of our software business  which was included in the gain on disposal of discontinued operations 
in fiscal and  we adopted plans to exit our hardware systems and hardware related software engineering and professional services businesses  as well as exit a sublease agreement and to reduce our general and administrative overhead costs

the decrease in stock based compensation in the year ended december  as compared with the year ended july  is due to approximately million of expense related to the modifications in the terms of stock option and awards granted to our former ceo as well as the impact of a change in our forfeiture rate assumption 
related party transactions we own approximately of the outstanding capital stock of collabnet  inc collabnet 
our holdings in collabnet consist of shares of collabnet s series c preferred stock 
as the company holds less than of the voting stock of collabnet and does not otherwise exercise significant influence over collabnet  this investment is accounted for under the cost method

in march  we determined an impairment indicator existed for this investment and as a result we performed a fair value analysis of this investment 
in determining whether a decline in value of our investment in collabnet had occurred and was other than temporary  we considered available evidence  including the general market conditions  collabnet s financial condition  near term prospects  market comparables and future financing requirements 
the valuation also takes into account collabnet s capital structure  liquidation preferences for its capital and other economic variables  which require management s judgment to evaluate 
based on the results  we determined that the estimated fair value of our investment in collabnet was million and accordingly  we recognized an other than temporary impairment charge of million 
the loss on disposal of asset is due to our deprecation of the marketplace platform from the sourceforge

interest expense for the five months ended december   results from accretion of our accrued restructuring charge  while interest expense for the five months ended december  was primarily due to interest expense on a legal settlement which was paid in january the increase in other income for the five months ended december  was primarily due to the million impact resulting from our fair value accounting for certain of our financial assets and a million gain on the sale of our investment in va linux systems japan  kk va japan 
the effect of our fair value accounting is a result of our recording the fair value of the right to sell our auction rate securities to ubs at par value 
the gain on the sale of our investment is the result of our sale of our investment in va linux japan kk for million in december income taxes year ended five months ended change change change december  july  december  year to fiscal to five months fiscal to in thousands unaudited provision for income taxes income tax provision consists of federal and state income tax expense on taxable income 
our state income tax is based on our taxable income or loss in each jurisdiction and we may not have net operating loss carryforwards available to offset taxable income in certain states 
we provide for state income taxes in the new jersey state jurisdiction based on our e commerce income in that state  and to the extent that our e commerce business unit is profitable  we may record an income tax provision  even though we generate losses on a consolidated basis 
as of december   we had million of federal net operating loss carry forwards available to offset future federal taxable income  which expire at various dates through approximately million of federal net operating losses usage is limited pursuant to section of the internal revenue code due to certain changes in our ownership which occurred between and  and a change in ownership resulting from our june acquisition of andover 
net 
we also have california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future california taxable income  which expire at various dates through we have not recognized any benefit from these net operating loss carry forwards because a valuation allowance has been recorded for the total deferred tax assets as a result of uncertainties regarding realization of the assets based on our limited history of profitability and the uncertainty of future profitability 
liquidity and capital resources year ended five months ended december  july  december  in thousands unaudited net cash provided by used in continuing operations operating activities investing activities financing activities discontinued operations net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents our principal sources of cash as of december  were our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments of million  which excludes restricted cash of million refer to financing activities below for a discussion on restricted cash 
we used million of cash for operating activities  million of cash for an acquisition  million of cash for the repurchase of common stock and million of cash for purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by maturities of marketable securities of million and proceeds from the sale of linux 
com of million resulting in an overall decrease in cash and investments of million during the year ended december our net cash generated from continuing operations during the year ended july  was million 
we also generated cash from net sales of securities of million during the year ended july  and through the collection of accounts receivable from discontinued operations in the amount of million 
these cash proceeds were offset by purchases of property and equipment of million and repurchases of common stock of million resulting in an overall increase in cash and investments of million for the year ended july  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million and we had net purchases of securities of million during the year ended july   resulting in an overall increase in cash and investments of million during the year ended july  this overall increase was primarily due to cash generated from continuing operations of million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options of million  offset in part by capitalized internally developed software of million and purchases of property and equipment of million and cash used in discontinued operations of million 
net cash from operating activities was million for the five months ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income of million  increased by non cash stock based compensation of million and depreciation expenses of million  offset by a non cash gain on sale of our investment in va japan of million and change in fair value of financial assets of million  related to our right to require our investment manager to purchase certain investments 
additionally  changes in operating assets and liabilities had a negligible offsetting effect to operating cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for the five months ended december  was primarily due to net income of million  non cash restructuring charges of million  stock based compensation of million and depreciation expenses of million  resulting from network equipment purchased for our new data center  and a decrease in accounts receivable of million  partially offset by increases in inventory of million and decreases in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of improved collection efforts 
the increase in inventory was due to our e commerce business s higher product sales and efforts to sell inventory during their holiday season and the decreases in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities are primarily related to the reclassification of million of accrued rent related to our fremont  california facility to restructuring reserve 
discontinued operations cash flow from discontinued operations has been reported separately for operating  investing and financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations in our ongoing operations is not expected to materially impact our future cash flow or liquidity due to the relatively modest amounts historically contributed by the discontinued operations 
operating activities year ended december  net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to our net operating loss of million after the effects of non cash charges  including an impairment charge of million  stock based compensation expense of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million  return for allowance of million  a loss on disposal of assets of million  related to the depreciation of the marketplace platform from the sourceforge 
net platform and a gain on our sale of the linux 
com domain name to the linux foundation of million 
additionally  changes in operating assets and liabilities included cash used for accrued restructuring liabilities of million  increases in inventory of million and increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of million  offset partially by cash provided by accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million and an increase in deferred revenue of million 
the increase in inventory due to purchases of inventory by our e commerce business in order to provide adequate inventory levels for anticipated demand  and the increase in prepaid and other assets are primarily related to inventory prepayments to vendors 
year ended july  net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended july  was primarily due to loss from continuing operations of million offset by non cash stock based compensation expense of million  restructuring expenses of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million and loss on disposal of investment of million as well as cash provided by accounts receivable of million  prepaid expenses and other assets of million and accounts payable of million 
this was partially offset by an increase in inventory of million and decreases in accrued restructuring of million and accrued and long term liabilities of million 
the cash provided by accounts receivable is primarily due to better collection efforts and increased revenue in our media business and the cash provided by prepaid expenses is due to reduced accrued interest balances resulting from the change in our investment portfolio to treasury bills and also reflects the reclassification of prepaid sublease rental income to the restructuring reserve 
the cash used for inventory is primarily due to increased inventory levels to support increases in our e commerce revenue and for higher levels of those products with long lead times 
the change in accrued restructuring includes million of non cash increase related to the reclassification of excess of straight line rent expense over the cash payments as well as cash payments on our former corporate headquarters located in fremont  california 
the cash used for accrued and long term liabilities is due to lower accrued liability balances and also reflects the reclassification of million of accrued rent expense to the restructuring reserve 
year ended july  net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended july  was primarily due to income from continuing operations of million  stock based compensation of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  depreciation and amortization of million and an increase in deferred revenue of million 
this was partly offset by cash used for increases in accounts receivable of million  inventory of million and prepaid expenses and other assets of million and decreases in restructuring liabilities of million and other long term liabilities of million 
the cash provided by accounts payable is the result of higher levels of inventory received and higher marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended july  and deferred revenue is primarily due to a program credit on a media agreement entered into in fiscal year ended july  the cash used for accounts receivable is primarily due to higher revenue and slower collection efforts in our media business  inventory is primarily the result of higher inventory levels as we broaden our product range and we maintain higher inventory levels as we expand our inventory sources outside of the united states which require longer lead times  prepaid expenses and other current assets is due to higher levels of prepayments for inventory related to our e commerce business  resulting from our increased purchases of product from suppliers located in countries where deposits or prepayments are customarily required to order product  restructuring liabilities is due to cash payments on facilities included in the restructuring reserve  and other long term liabilities is due to a reduction in deferred rent expense 
five months ended december  net cash from operating activities was million for the five months ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income of million  increased by non cash stock based compensation of million and depreciation expenses of million  offset by a non cash gain on sale of our investment in va linux systems japan  kk of million and change in fair value of financial assets of million  related to our right to require our investment manager to purchase certain investments 
additionally  changes in operating assets and liabilities had a negligible offsetting effect to operating cash flows 
five months ended december  net cash provided by operating activities of million for the five months ended december  was primarily due to net income of million  non cash restructuring charges of million  stock based compensation of million and depreciation expenses of million  resulting from network equipment purchased for our new data center  and a decrease in accounts receivable of million  partially offset by increases in inventory of million and decreases in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of improved collection efforts 
the increase in inventory was due to our e commerce business s higher product sales and efforts to sell inventory during their holiday season and the decreases in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities are primarily related to the reclassification of million of accrued rent related to our fremont  california facility to restructuring reserve 
we expect to utilize cash to fund investments in our business  working capital requirements for our business growth and to pay off our remaining lease obligations for our fremont  california facility 
investing activities our investing activities primarily include purchases of property and equipment and purchases and sales of marketable securities 
cash usage for the year ended december  included million for the acquisition of ohloh and million for the purchase of property and equipment  offset in part by maturities of marketable securities of million 
cash usage related to purchases of property and equipment for the year ended july  of million was primarily due to software and equipment purchased for our new data center of million and internally developed software of million and to a lesser extent additional leasehold improvements for our new corporate facilities in mountain view  california 
cash usage related to purchases of property and equipment for the year ended july  of million  was primarily due to internally developed software related to our sourceforge 
net marketplace platform of million and to a lesser extent additional equipment purchases 
cash usage related to purchases of property and equipment for the five months ended december  was primarily due to purchase of property and equipment of million  for our data center 
we also generated proceeds of million from the sale of our investment in va linux systems japan  kk cash usage related to property and equipment purchases of million for the five months ended december  was primarily due to the purchase of million of equipment  internally developed software of million and to a lesser extent leasehold improvement purchases 
the purchase of equipment was primarily related to equipment purchases for our data center and to a lesser extent to leasehold improvements related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters to mountain view 
we also generated net proceeds of million from the sale of marketable securities investments which were converted to cash and cash equivalents 
financing activities our financing activities have primarily included cash proceeds from the sale of our common stock through employee benefit plans 
our financing activities during the year ended december  were primarily comprised of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock under the repurchase program approved by our board of directors in november  offset in part by proceeds from the sale of our common stock through equity incentive plans 
the stock repurchase program expired in october for the years ended december   july  and july   respectively  exchange rate changes had an immaterial effect on cash and cash equivalents 
we expect that exchange rate changes will have an immaterial effect on cash and cash equivalents in the near future due to our focus on us based business 
as of december  and july   we had an outstanding letter of credit of approximately million  related to the fremont  california facility lease 
the amount related to this letter of credit is recorded in the restricted cash section of the consolidated balance sheet 
our liquidity and capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including our investment in inventory to support the e commerce business  market acceptance of our online products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our online products  the timing and expense associated with expanding our distribution channels  potential acquisitions and other factors 
we expect to devote capital resources to continue our research and development efforts  to invest in our sales  support  marketing and product development organizations  to enhance and introduce marketing programs  to invest in capital projects to continue to support our operations and related support systems and infrastructure  and for other general corporate activities and investments 
a change in our third party contract fulfillment and warehouse provider will require significant capital resources 
we believe that our existing cash balances will be sufficient to fund our operations through the year ending december  under our current business strategy 
auction rate securities and ars right at december   all of our investments were recorded at fair value 
as defined by fair value  a significant portion of our investments were classified as either level or level  however  we classified million of municipal bond investments with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars as level the underlying assets of these auction rate securities are student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
since february  auctions for ars have failed and  consequently  the investments are not currently liquid 
at december   all of our ars were rated aaa by at least one credit rating agency 
we do not expect to need to access these funds in the short term  however  in the event we need to access these funds  they are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs a successful auction  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities mature 
in october  we accepted an offer from ubs  our investment advisor  granting us the right to require ubs to purchase our ars at their par value of million anytime during the two year period beginning june  ars right 
ubs has also established a program which allows us to establish a no net cost line of credit and borrow up to percent of the market value of the ars at interest rates equal to the return we receive on the underlying ars securities 
we valued the ars using a discounted cash flow approach 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model were based on data available as of december  and include estimates of interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit spread related yield and illiquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of the ars 
these assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change 
we valued our ars and the ars right at fair value 
since the ars right is directly related to our ars investments  we elected to recognize the changes in the fair value of the ars and the ars right as a gain or loss in operations 
we valued the ars right using level inputs as the difference between the par value and the fair value of the ars  as adjusted for any bearer risk associated with ubs s financial ability to repurchase the ars beginning june  we currently believe that the bearer risk associated with ubs is insignificant and have not made any adjustment to the fair value of the ars right for bearer risk 
contractual obligations the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments 
the following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands years ending december  total and and gross operating lease obligations sublease income net operating lease obligations purchase obligations total obligations sublease income represents our expectations of payments to be received from our subtenants 
as of december   a portion of our excess facility is sublet through may  the remainder of its lease term and a portion of our corporate facility is sublet through september financial risk management as a primarily us centric company  we face limited exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and we do not engage in hedging activity 
we do not anticipate significant currency gains or losses in the near term 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale or trading 
these securities are not leveraged 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued a new standard which updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance 
the revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting  and eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration 
in addition  the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of  with early adoption permitted provided that the revised guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption 
we are currently assessing the impact of this new accounting update on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb provided further guidance on how to measure the fair value of a liability  an area where practitioners have been seeking further guidance 
it primarily does three things sets forth the types of valuation techniques to be used to value a liability when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability and clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are level fair value measurements 
this standard was adopted in the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued a new standard which requires an analysis to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this statement requires an ongoing reassessment and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining whether an entity is the primary beneficiary 
this standard is effective for we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued a new standard  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
this standard is effective for our calendar year reporting  except for level reconciliation disclosures which are effective for our calendar year reporting 
we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
at december   we had million of municipal bond investments with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars 
the underlying assets of these auction rate securities are student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
since february  auctions for ars have failed and the investments are not currently liquid  however  ubs ag ubs  our investment advisor has agreed to purchase our ars at their par value of million anytime during the two year period beginning june  ars right 
consequently  we have classified these ars as short term investments 
ubs has also established a program which allows us to establish a no net cost line of credit and borrow up to percent of the market value of the ars at interest rates equal to the return we receive on the underlying ars securities 
at december   all of our ars were rated aaa by at least one credit rating agency 
we valued the ars using a discounted cash flow approach 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model were based on data available as of december  and include estimates of interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of the ars 
these assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change 
at december   we had million of investments with a weighted average interest rate of percent 
we have operated primarily in the united states  and virtually all sales have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
the estimated fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and investments approximate carrying value 
we do not currently hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in hedging activities
