overview we design  develop and market a family of innovative technology based learning platforms and related proprietary content for infants to children twelve years old for use at home and in schools around the world 
we have created more than interactive software titles  covering important subjects such as phonics  reading  writing and math 
in addition  we have a broad line of stand alone educational products  or learning toys  that do not require the separate purchase of software and are generally targeted at children from infancy through age five 
our products are available in four languages and are sold globally through retailers  distributors and directly to schools 
our goal is to create educational products that kids love  parents trust and teachers value 
we generate revenue from selling platform hardware  including our tag and tag jr 
reading systems  our classic leapster  leapster and didj educational gaming platforms  and our clickstart my first computer and zippity learning systems  along with a range of learning toys 
we also generate revenue from the sale of a wide range of content for our platforms that we develop based on licensed characters or using leapfrog owned characters 
we introduced the leapfrog learning path  a web based service that helps parents track what their children are learning with our web connected products  in the united states and canada in and in early in the united kingdom 
learning path gives our consumers access to a variety of downloadable content and to online rewards programs that encourage learning 
learning path also makes it easier for our consumers to age up with our products 
parents are able to see the learning and gain personalized insight into their child s learning progress 
many of our products  including the tag reading system  launched in  the leapster handheld gaming system  launched in  the tag junior reading system  launched in  and my pal scout and my pal violet  also launched in  are designed to connect to the learning path 
our products compete most directly in the toy industry in the pre school toy and electronic learning aids categories  both in the united states and in selected international markets 
the educational toy category continues to attract new entrants as well as new innovative products  and competition is significant 
our business is highly seasonal with a significant portion of our revenues occurring in the second half of the year 
given relatively low sales volumes in the first half of the year and the relatively fixed nature of many of our operating expenses  which occur fairly evenly throughout the year  our results of operations are generally stronger in our third and fourth quarters relative to our first and second quarters 
conversely  our cash flow from operations tends to be highest in the first quarter of the year when we collect the majority of our accounts receivable related to the prior year s fourth quarter sales 
cash flow from operations generally tends to be lowest in our third quarter  as accounts receivables collections taper off and we are building inventory in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season 
the reduction in cash flow in the third quarter generally means that our available cash is at its lowest point for the year in the first month of the fourth quarter 
this pattern differed in based on declines in sales in the fourth quarter of as a result of the global economic crisis 
as retailers reacted to sharply declining consumer spending  our sales for the fourth quarter of were significantly below our expectations and constituted a substantially smaller percentage of our annual sales than fourth quarter sales had in previous years 
fourth quarter sales in were of total sales for the year as compared to the same period of in which sales made up only of total net sales for the year  a decline year over year 
in  we returned to our normal seasonal pattern with fourth quarter sales making up of total sales for the year 

table of contents in addition  weak retail consumer spending in the fourth quarter of generated unusually high retail inventory levels  which had an adverse impact on net sales for the first three quarters of given the seasonality of our business  declines in sales in the third and fourth quarters generally have a disproportionate impact on our annual operating results for that year and for cash flows from operations at the beginning of the following year due to higher than anticipated retailer inventory levels 
stronger consumer demand during the fourth quarter of resulted in low retail inventory levels to close although  in light of the current ongoing economic uncertainty  no assurance can be given  sales in the first quarter of should benefit as we anticipate increased shipments to replenish the lean retail inventories 
despite some signs of modest economic recovery  we may still face significant risk associated with reduced consumer spending 
the potential business risk for us from macroeconomic conditions anticipated for is discussed further in part ii 
item a 
risk factors economic declines has have had a material adverse effect on our sales  and a slow recovery could prevent us from achieving our financial goals in and beyond  retailer liquidity problems could harm our liquidity and financial results  and our liquidity may be insufficient to meet the long term or periodic needs of our business 
reducing our cost structure to remain competitive in a historically severe economic environment was a priority in for example  during the second quarter of  we sublet a portion of our headquarter facilities in emeryville  california 
during the fourth quarter of  we consolidated the administrative operations of our subsidiaries in france and the united kingdom 
further  throughout the year we continued to automate and simplify our operational processes  reduced staffing levels  and spent less  and plan to continue spending less  on non targeted advertising 
driving further cost efficiencies in will continue to be a high priority 
we intend to focus our spending resources on building out our core product lines and improving the marketability and scope of our content library 
we invest in research and development of existing and new lines of business that we believe will contribute to our long term growth and profitability 
for example  we continue to invest in developing new hardware platforms and content based on the latest relevant technologies that impact both offline and online play experiences 
we believe delivering innovative and high value experiences that are fun and that facilitate learning in kids who play with our products is the key to our future growth 
our strategic priorities for and beyond are to invest in the core categories of interactive reading  educational gaming  our learning toy line and in our learning path 
our marketing will be aimed at increasing consumer sales in each of these lines  driving content sales to be a greater percentage of our overall sales  and catalyzing new growth in the children s learning category 
we launched new connected products and content in our reading and gaming lines  and we expanded our learning toy line in new learning toy products include our widely reviewed and relatively inexpensive scout line of learning toys  and the zippity learning system  a gaming system featuring full body movement controls  which is our first co branded product with disney 
we organize  operate and assess our business in two primary operating segments united states and international 
historically  we operated a school segment that sold products tailored for the united states educational market directly to schools  teacher supply stores and through catalogs and websites aimed at educators 
during  we significantly reduced our direct marketing to the educational channel  reduced headcount and direct facilities expenses accordingly  and transferred responsibility for this sales channel to the former us consumer operating segment 
this modification is consistent with how the chief operating decision maker reviews performance  allocates resources and manages the business 
accordingly  we have consolidated and reclassified the results of the former us consumer and school segments into the united states segment for the fiscal years ended december   and see note segment reporting in our consolidated financial statements included in this form k for certain detailed information on our segments and their financial results  our customers and our products for the fiscal years ended december   and 
table of contents results of operations revisions for the years ended and subsequent to the issuance of our september  unaudited consolidated financial statements  we determined there was an error in the way our stock plan management and reporting software was calculating stock based compensation expense 
we became aware of the error as a result of an upgrade to a newer version of the software  which calculated stock based compensation expense amounts for prior periods that were different from those calculated using the older version 
specifically  the older software version we had been using calculated stock based compensation expense by incorrectly applying a weighted average forfeiture rate to the vested portion of stock option awards until the grant s final vest date  rather than calculating stock based compensation expense based upon the actual vested portion of the grant date fair value 
as a result  stock based compensation expense was understated in certain periods prior to the grant s final vest date 
consequently  revision of the errors in the calculation and recognition of stock based compensation expense increased operating expenses  and therefore  increased net loss by million  million and million  for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
we have determined that the impact of these errors is not significant to the previously issued annual and interim financial statements as defined by accounting standards codification asc topic  accounting changes and error corrections 
the audited financial statements  related notes  tables and analyses for the years ended december  and have been revised in this form k filing 
in addition  all references to results for the year ended december  have also been revised 
all future filings  including interim financial statements  will be revised appropriately

change vs 
dollars in millions net sales gross margin operating expenses loss from operations net loss per share basic and diluted gross profit as a percentage of net sales percentage point change in gross margin fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales for declined from those recorded in the decline was driven primarily by the high year end retail inventory levels and depressed consumer spending due to the weakened economy  which led to lower shipments for the first three quarters of the year end retail inventory levels impacted all business lines  but had the most profound impact on the gaming business  including both platforms and software related content 
net sales for included a negative impact from changes in currency exchanges rates of one percentage point 
gross margin improved two percentage points in to as a result of a higher proportion of sales of high margin products and reductions in sales returns allowances due lower retail inventory levels and the fact that we had no charges in related to the consumer product safety improvement act as compared to in addition  we reduced our allowance for defective products  as claims have trended lower than expected 
these increases were offset in part by increased use of discounting and promotions in 
table of contents operating expenses decreased in as compared to  primarily due to reduced headcount  reductions in advertising  and lower bad debt expense 
the number of total fulltime employees declined by  or  from december  to december   due to a combination of reductions in force and the migration of certain aspects of our product development cycle to external parties

the weighted average of basic and diluted common shares outstanding remained relatively level 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales for increased by from those recorded in  primarily driven by the launch of several new product platforms including tag  leapster and didj  the positive effect of which was partially offset by declining sales of our older products  some of which were being retired 
net sales for included a positive impact from changes in currency exchanges rates of one percentage point 
net sales related to new platform products and related content introduced in totaled approximately million  or of total net sales 
gross margin percentage improved slightly in as compared to as new products launched in generally had higher margins and we did not experience the same level of asset write offs as in specifically  the large unamortized balances of the fly fusion related assets were written down to reflect declining sales trends in these improvements to gross margin were partially offset by lower sales through the school channel  increased discounting  higher sales returns allowances related to weakening consumer demand and higher than expected retail inventory levels at the end of  and costs associated with a voluntary recall of the didj recharging station 
operating expenses declined in as compared to reflecting reduced headcount related expenses and the absence of costs for legal settlements  offset slightly by an increase in bad debt expense 
over the past three years we have focused on reducing our cost structure through driving efficiencies 
total fulltime employees declined by  or  from december  to december   due to a combination of reductions in force and the migration of certain aspects of our product development cycle to external parties 
legal costs were considerably lower in as included million in patent defense and settlement expenses associated with a patent lawsuit 
bad debt expense increased by million in due to several customer bankruptcies as well as an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts given the weakening retail environment 
our basic and diluted net loss per share improved by in as compared to due primarily to the decrease in our total net loss  as the weighted average of basic and diluted common shares outstanding remained relatively level 
outlook we expect continued  albeit modest  economic improvement in  which should drive increased retail spending and stronger retail sales growth than we experienced in we believe additional factors  such as lean year end retail inventory levels  our ability to leverage our learning path  new product introductions across all categories  and our entry into new distribution channels should accelerate net sales growth 
further  we expect that additional software based content sales and our lower cost structure will result in positive operating income for however  our expectations for sales growth and operating income are subject to many uncertainties  including the timing and strength of any economic recovery and many other factors described below under risk factors in item a of this form k  there can be no assurance that consumer demand for our products will improve in compared to

this improvement was partially offset by higher bank commitment fee expense amortization associated with the renewal of our credit facility in august fiscal year compared to fiscal year interest income declined in as compared to  due both to lower average excess cash balances available for investment and a change in investment vehicles from a combination of money market funds  commercial paper and other similar short term instruments in to only money market funds invested in high quality short term us government obligations in  which have lower yields due to their relatively low risk 
the other  net category consists primarily of impairment losses on our ars  which losses increased in as the general economic uncertainty and adverse credit market conditions deepened  driving lower valuations of these securities 
summary of results by segment for fiscal years ended december   and the net sales  gross margin  total operating expenses and operating loss amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and on an operating segment basis consistent with our internal management reporting structure

the increase in the ratio of platforms to net sales in was driven by the tag  leapster and didj launches  typically  new platform related software sales lag platform adoption for a period after the platform is initially released for sale 
gross margin remained level at year over year reflecting a number of offsetting factors 
the gross margin benefited from sales of new  higher margin products launched during the year  lower asset write offs than those experienced in  specifically the fly fusion assets which were written down to reflect declining sales trends in  and reductions in the allowances for unclaimed reimbursements due to customers under promotional and co operative advertising agreements

the sales declines were broad based 
declines in our european markets were attributable to lower sales of older products  the effects of which were only partially offset by first year sales of tag 
our asian market sales declined significantly in as our new products were not introduced in those markets in we experienced only modest growth in the mexico and canadian markets 
our gross margin percentage remained relatively constant  decreasing one percentage point in although during the second half of there was an increase in sales of higher gross margin products  this improvement 
table of contents was offset by a weighted average decline in the value of the dollar during the fourth quarter of approximately 
the most significant decline in the dollar was against certain asian currencies 
the increase in our loss from operations reflected declining net sales 
income taxes our income taxes benefit provision and our effective tax rates were million  million and million  and  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our pretax losses were million  million and million for the same periods  respectively 
calculation of the effective tax rates for all periods included a non cash valuation allowance recorded against our domestic deferred tax assets 
the income tax benefit was largely related to the release of tax reserves due to expiring statutes of limitation 
the income tax expense in and was primarily attributable to our foreign operations  which were offset partially by a us federal income tax refund 
in we received an income tax refund from the irs in settlement of an audit related to our research and development carry back claims for the years through the total tax benefit attributable to this refund was million  including interest paid by the irs 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
in line with our investment policy  all cash equivalents were invested in money market funds that held only high grade united states government obligations at december  as of december   we held million  stated at fair value  in long term investments in auction rate securities 
the uncertainties in the credit and financial markets since the fourth quarter of have prevented us from fully liquidating our ars holdings as the number of securities submitted for sale in periodic auctions has exceeded the number of purchase orders 
in the fourth quarter of  we were able to tender a portion of our ars holdings with original par value of million 
the fair value of our remaining ars investment has declined by million from its original par value of million 
due to the illiquidity of these investments  we have not included and do not intend  for the foreseeable future  to include them as potential sources of liquidity in our future cash flow projections 
thus  we do not anticipate that future declines in value  if any  will have an adverse impact on our future ability to support operations and meet our obligations as they come due 
because the fair value of million for the auction rate securities investment constitutes only of our total assets at december   we also do not anticipate any material adverse impact on our overall capital position should the fair value of these investments decline to zero 
as of september   our agreements with contract manufacturers were modified such that title and risk of loss now transfer upon delivery of finished goods 
because we no longer hold title to any work in progress inventory  our overall inventory balance is  and will continue to be  lower than it would have been had we not modified our agreements 
we have an asset backed revolving credit facility  which is discussed in more detail below  with a potential borrowing availability of million 
there were no borrowings outstanding on this line of credit at december  our accumulated deficit of million at december  is not expected to impact our future ability to operate  given our anticipated cash flows from operations  our strong cash position and the availability of our credit facility 

table of contents future capital expenditures are planned to be primarily for new product development and purchases related to the upgrading of our information technology capabilities 
we expect that capital expenditures in  including those for capitalized content and website development costs  will be funded with cash flows generated by operations and will remain lower than in prior years 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we believe that cash on hand  cash flow from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will provide adequate funds for our foreseeable working capital needs and planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
our strategies for capital expenditures will be focused on driving sales of our learn to read and educational gaming market platforms  introducing additional connected products  expanding our content library  establishing parents familiarity with the learning path and expanding our online play components 
our ability to fund our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures  as well as our ability to comply with all of the financial covenants of our credit facility  depend on our future operating performance and cash flows  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions  including the limited availability of capital in light of the current economic downturn  and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control

net sales in the fourth quarter of increased over the same period of  with a significant portion of the sales occurring later in the quarter compared to the same period of while net inventory declined by million as a result of the stronger fourth quarter sales and effective production management  net accounts receivable increased by million 
given that a majority of the sales occurred later in the quarter  a larger proportion of sales were not due until as compared to sales at the end of net cash flow used in investing activities decreased by million in driven by reductions in capital expenditures  principally property and equipment and capitalized content  as well as proceeds received from the sale of part of our investment in ars 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net cash flow from operations in improved over by million 
a primary contributor to the improvement in over was the million decrease in our net loss from to other significant operating cash flow changes included an increase in of million in accounts receivable related allowances which included the amounts attributable to the effects of the financial crisis on our 
table of contents business  primarily the allowances for bad debts  sales and product returns  a decrease in inventories of million in  primarily attributable to increased allowances for potential product returns including those affected by the cpsia safety regulations and a million decrease in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue in caused by lower accruals for employee bonuses  legal settlement expenses and general marketing expenses in net cash flow used in investing activities increased by million in as net proceeds from the sales and purchases of investments declined by million  offset by a million decline in capital expenditures 
net cash used by financing activities increased by million as proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans declined significantly due to the deteriorating stock price in which depressed stock purchases 
seasonal patterns of cash provided by or used in operations the table below shows our seasonal patterns of cash flow provided by used in operations by quarter for the fiscal years ended december   and dollars in millions st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter total  net for fiscal year generally  our cash flow from operations tends to be highest in the first quarter of the year when we collect the majority of our accounts receivable booked in the fourth quarter of the prior year 
cash flow used in operations tends to be highest in our third quarter  as collections from prior accounts receivables taper off and we invest heavily in inventory in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season 
cash flow generally turns positive again in the fourth quarter as we start to collect on the current holiday season accounts receivables 
our quarterly cash flows also did not fully conform to our historical pattern 
net sales fell on a year over year basis from through this resulted in a decline in cash collected from accounts receivable from year to year for the three year period  negatively impacting cash flows in the first quarter of each subsequent year 
in  this net sales related cash flow decline was partially offset during the fourth quarter as we tightened our cash management practices in response to the economic crisis  resulting in an increase in accounts payable of approximately million at the end of as compared to the end of thus  cash flow provided by operations was higher in the fourth quarter of than in the first quarter of line of credit and borrowing availability on august   we  certain financial institutions lenders and bank of america  na  as agent for the lenders the agent entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement for a million asset based revolving credit facility loan agreement 
the maturity date of the facility is august   at which time any borrowings under the facility must be repaid 
we may make voluntary prepayments of borrowings at any time 
provided there is no default under the loan agreement and subject to availability of additional credit  we may elect  without the consent of any of the lenders  to increase the size of the credit facility under the loan agreement up to an aggregate of million 
the borrowing availability varies according to the levels of our eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory and cash and investment securities deposited in secured accounts with the administrative agent or other lenders 
availability under this agreement was million  and we had no borrowings outstanding as of december  
table of contents this new credit facility supersedes and replaces our previous million credit facility dated november  which would have otherwise expired in november and was terminated as of august  in connection with signing of the loan agreement 
the loan agreement includes the following terms  which are substantially similar to those of the terminated agreement the borrowing availability varies according to the levels of our accounts receivable  inventory  and cash and investment securities deposited in secured accounts with the agent or other lenders 
subject to the level of this borrowing base  we may make and repay borrowings from time to time until the maturity of the facility 
the interest rate is  at our election  the agent s prime rate or base rate or a libor rate defined in the loan agreement  plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the applicable margin for a loan depends on the average daily availability for the most recent fiscal quarter and the type of loan the loan agreement contains customary events of default  including payment failures  failure to comply with covenants  failure to satisfy other obligations under the credit agreements or related documents  defaults in respect of other indebtedness  bankruptcy  insolvency and inability to pay debts when due  material judgments  change in control provisions and the invalidity of the guaranty or security agreements 
if any event of default under the loan agreement occurs  the agent or the other lenders may terminate their respective commitments  declare immediately due all borrowings under the facility and foreclose on the collateral 
a cross default provision applies if a default occurs on other indebtedness in excess of million and the applicable grace period in respect of the indebtedness has expired  such that the lender of  or trustee for  the defaulted indebtedness has the right to accelerate 
we have granted a security interest in substantially all of our assets to the agent as security for its obligations under the facility 
we are required to maintain a ratio of ebitda to fixed charges  each as defined in the loan agreement  of at least to when the covenant is required to be tested compared to to under the terminated agreement 
as with the terminated agreement  the ratio is measured only if certain borrowing availability thresholds are not met 
under the loan agreement for the new credit facility  the interest rate is  initially  for libor rate loans  over the libor rate or  for base rate loans  over the agent s prime rate 
after six months  the interest rate will vary based on borrowing availability 
contractual obligations and commitments we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
we conduct our corporate operations from leased facilities and rent equipment under operating leases 
generally  these have initial lease periods of three to twelve years and contain provisions for renewal options of five years at market rates 
we account for rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the following table summarizes our outstanding long term contractual obligations at december  contractual obligations at december  payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years operating leases royalty guarantees total 
table of contents at december   we had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under our asset backed line of credit facility with bank of america  na at december   we had million of potential availability on the line 
in addition  we had commitments to purchase inventory totaling approximately million at december  critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap or gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
we believe that certain accounting policies  which we refer to as critical accounting policies  are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the use of significant estimates and the application of significant judgment by our management 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  particularly those related to our critical accounting policies 
the following discussion highlights those policies and the underlying estimates and assumptions  which we consider critical to an understanding of the financial information in this report 
revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and other revenue reserves revenue derived from sales of our technology based learning products and related proprietary content is recognized when products are shipped and title passes to the customer  provided that there is evidence of a commercial arrangement  delivery has occurred  there is a fixed or determinable fee and collection is reasonably assured 
for online content downloads  delivery is considered to occur when the download occurs 
for professional training services  delivery is considered to occur when the training has been performed 
net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances based primarily on volume purchasing levels  estimated returns  allowances for defective products  markdowns and other sales allowances for customer promotions 
a small portion of our revenue related to subscriptions is recognized as revenue over the period of the subscription 
the accounts receivable balance is reduced by an allowance for amounts we believe may become uncollectible 
determining the amounts that may become uncollectible requires judgment  the result of which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported in accounts receivable 
this allowance is an estimate based primarily on our management s evaluation of the customer s financial condition in the context of current economic conditions  past collection history and aging of the accounts receivable balances 
if changes in the economic climate or in the financial condition of any of our customers impair or improve their ability to make payments  adjustments to the allowances may be required 
we provide estimated allowances against accounts receivable and revenue for product returns  defective products  charge backs  promotions and cooperative advertising arrangements with customers in the same period that we record the related revenue 
the allowances are estimated utilizing historical information  maximum known exposures and other available information including current retailer inventory levels  sell through of its retailers and distributors  current trends in retail for its products  changes in customer demand for its products and other related factors 
accounts receivable are reported on the balance sheet net of all provided allowances 
our provision for bad debts in was million as compared to million in fair value of financial instruments fair value is defined by authoritative guidance as the exit price  or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date 
the guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of 
table of contents observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability 
the authoritative guidance establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets  or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable eg  interest rates  yield curves  default rates  etc 
or can be corroborated by observable market data 
level valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable 
the unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use 
our level assets consist of money market funds and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less 
these assets are considered highly liquid and are stated at cost which approximates market value 
our level assets and liabilities consist of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts with maturities of approximately one month used to hedge its exposure to certain foreign currencies including the british pound  canadian dollar  euro  and peso 
our level assets consist of investments in auction rate securities ars 
currently  there is no active market for these securities  therefore  they do not have readily determinable market values 
we have engaged a third party valuation firm to estimate the fair value of the ars investments using a discounted cash flow approach  which is corroborated by a separate and comparable discounted cash flow analysis prepared internally 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model are based on data available as of the last day of the reporting period and include estimates of interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of the ars 
given the current market environment  these assumptions are volatile and subject to change  and therefore could result in significant changes to the estimated fair value of our ars 
in and we recognized losses on our ars of million and million  respectively 
inventory valuation inventories are stated on a first in  first out basis at the lower of cost or market value 
inventory valuation primarily involves our management s estimation of slow moving  obsolete or excess products 
our estimate of the write down for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories is based on our management s review of on hand inventories compared to their estimated future usage  product demand forecast  anticipated product selling prices  the expected product lifecycle  and products planned for discontinuation 
if actual future usage  demand for our products and anticipated product selling prices were less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write downs would be required resulting in a negative impact on our gross margin 
we monitor the estimates of inventory write downs on a quarterly basis 
when considered necessary  we make additional adjustments to reduce inventory to its net realizable value  with corresponding increases to cost of goods sold 
inventories included write downs for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories of million and million at december  and  respectively 
capitalization of content development costs we capitalize certain external costs related to the development of content for our learning products once technological feasibility has been established for the related projects 
our capitalized external costs generally relate to design  artwork  animation  layout  editing  voice  audio and software included in the learning products 
we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized content on a quarterly basis 
capitalized costs for products that are cancelled  abandoned or otherwise deemed impaired are charged to expense in the period of cancellation 
our evaluation in resulted in very few impairments while the evaluation identified capitalized costs related to several platforms that had recently been retired or discontinued 
accordingly  we accelerated the 
table of contents amortization of these costs  resulting in an increase in cost of sales in the united states reporting unit of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
we also capitalize external website development costs  which presently comprise primarily third party costs related to developing applications that are an integral component of certain products we market  as well as some costs incurred to develop or acquire and customize code for web applications  costs to develop html web pages or develop templates 
we evaluate the future recoverability of website costs on a quarterly basis and if an impairment loss is considered to have occurred during the period  the loss is recorded in the statement of operations in the same period 
our evaluations of capitalized content and website costs require us to make complex and subjective judgments  using currently available data as well as projections about the potential impact of possible future events and conditions  which judgments and projections are inherently uncertain 
if future events and conditions do not meet expectations  we make additional adjustments to reduce the expected realizable value of the assets  with corresponding increases to cost of sales 
capitalized content and website costs are both included in capitalized product costs on the balance sheet 
goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment at the end of each fiscal year and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the applicable reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors or operating performance indicators 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities including goodwill to those reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow methodology 
the market approach requires considerable judgment in selecting comparable companies and estimating the multiples of revenues implied by their market values 
the discounted cash flow methodology requires management to exercise judgment in selecting an appropriate discount rate and in making numerous assumptions in order to develop future business and financial forecasts and the related estimates of future net cash flows 
future net cash flows depend primarily on future sales of our products  which are inherently difficult to predict 
this is especially true when a significant portion of our future net sales is expected to be generated by both mature products as well as products introduced in and planned to be introduced in after analyzing our goodwill at december  and  we concluded no impairment charge was required in either period 
at december  and we had million and million of goodwill and other intangible assets  respectively 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
we calculate our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates and laws that we expect will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
in determining our income tax assets and liabilities we make significant estimates and judgments in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we provide valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted requires judgment about factors such as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
our financial statements also include accruals for the estimated amounts of probable future assessments that may result from the examination of federal  state or international tax returns 
our tax accruals  tax provision  deferred tax assets or income tax liabilities may be adjusted if there are changes in circumstances  such as changes in tax law  tax audits or other 
table of contents factors  that cause management to revise its estimates 
the amounts ultimately paid on any future assessments may differ from the amounts accrued and may result in an increase or reduction to the effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
such adjustments could have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized in compensation expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of stock based compensation awards at grant date requires significant judgment and estimates regarding valuation variables such as volatility  expected forfeiture rates and the expected term of the awards 
stock based compensation expense may be significantly affected by changes in our stock price  our actual forfeiture rates and the extent of future grants of equity awards 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected
