item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and uncertainties and elsewhere in this document 
overview we commenced our exploration stage in january with the change in the management of the company 
from january until march  we were strictly a mineral exploration company 
beginning with the management appointments of john swallow and paul dircksen  the addition of randal hardy  our acquisition of a drilling services company  the acquisition of butte highlands  and the acquisition of staccato gold resources ltd  we continue to advance our business plan 
prior to our new business model  the addition of new management  the purchase of timberline drilling formerly known as kettle drilling  and a more active and focused exploration division  the company had no reported revenues and accumulated losses 

table of contents we achieved significant milestones during our acquisition of staccato gold resources ltd 
and its south eureka property in nevada s battle mountain eureka gold trend  which includes the lookout mountain project  added an advanced stage exploration project and other earlier stage exploration opportunities to our portfolio 
we have commenced a significant and focused exploration campaign at south eureka  and we expect to announce an updated gold mineralization estimate in fiscal year our butte highlands joint venture in montana continued to make progress during the fiscal year 
the joint venture completed all surface facilities and advanced the underground ramp to the top of the expected mineralization  and we continue to move forward with the remaining underground mine development and permitting activities 
underground definition drilling began subsequent to our fiscal year end  and we anticipate commencement of gold production in early q our drilling services subsidiary  timberline drilling  was very successful in the united states during  earning approximately million in net income in fy and a solid gross margin of 
timberline drilling also extended its drilling contract with newmont into and added other clients with long term mining projects 
we made the decision late in the year to discontinue operations at our mexican drilling services subsidiary  wwe  and we redeployed wwe s drilling assets to the united states for potential use by timberline drilling 
drilling services timberline drilling provides both surface and underground drilling services  with its largest client being newmont mining 
timberline drilling specializes in underground  hard rock core drilling a niche business that we believe is well positioned as the industry continues to mature and exploration projects are advanced into producing mines 
our underground focus has provided a solid base of operations during times when a large percentage of the above ground and more speculative exploration drilling has been cut back and or delayed due to economic conditions 
in prior fiscal years there was a significant liability on the company s balance sheet related to interest and penalties for late payment of payroll taxes for payrolls during the period from october  through may  this liability was generated during a period of substantial company growth when timberline drilling s previous management team used available funds to pay other liabilities of the subsidiary rather than paying the payroll taxes and resulting penalties and interest 
the company repaid all outstanding payroll taxes owing from these periods during the year ending september   and repaid all related irs penalties and interest during the year ended september  as a result  the irs has released all liens against timberline drilling  and there are no longer any liabilities on the company s balance sheet related to unpaid payroll taxes  penalties  or interest 
nbs p  the company has made timely payments on all payroll taxes since may  during the year ended september   due to declining operational and financial results  we decided to cease the operations of timberline drilling s wholly owned mexican subsidiary  wwe 
wwe s drill rigs and related assets were moved back to the us where they are available for use by timberline drilling 
revenue at timberline drilling increased considerably during the past year as a result of increased drilling activity in the united states 
the increased drilling activity occurred primarily due to renewed availability of exploration and development capital  improvements in the global economy and higher prices for both gold and silver 
our management team has continued to focus its efforts throughout the past year on managing our expenses in relation to our current rates of revenue to assure sustainable profitability from our drilling entity 
while we still believe additional improvements can be made  timberline drilling has now achieved six consecutive quarters of profitability 
for fiscal year  we expect demand for our drilling services to increase compared to the prior year  with a corresponding increase in the utilization of our drilling rigs 
we expect to generate moderate revenue growth with our largest customer  our other customers  and new customers as we continue to develop relationships and demonstrate excellent performance 
we intend to continue to streamline the operations and carefully manage costs in order to generate greater profitability and provide positive cash flow to the parent company 
safety will remain a priority as we expect to continue to operate with no lost time accidents and to reduce the number of incidents 
mineral exploration as noted above  in june   the company acquired staccato gold resources ltd 
and its south eureka property in the nevada s battle mountain eureka gold trend  which includes the lookout mountain project  and is one of the largest undeveloped exploration properties in nevada  encompassing some square miles 
since our acquisition of staccato  we commenced an aggressive  work program on the south eureka property 
the program objective was designed to obtain sufficient data to complete an updated mineralization estimate  conduct metallurgical studies and tests  and detail map the geology of the property to better understand the controls of mineralization and to outline additional exploration drill targets for testing in the information generated by this program is expected to be incorporated into a preliminary economic assessment during the year ended september as of september  timberline is on schedule at lookout mountain  with one timberline drilling core rig and two rc rigs operating on site 
the metallurgical scoping study has been formalized  and geologic mapping is on going 
all drilling and geologic mapping will be completed by december   and metallurgical testing commenced in november at butte highlands  a seven hole core drilling program was completed during the year ending september  the program had two purposes  one was to infill and expand mineralization within the known area of mineralized material  and the second was to test potential for mineralization to the east  outside the area of known mineralization 
three holes were drilled within the known extents of the mineralized 
table of contents area while four holes were drilled outside to the east of the known extents 
although we did not encounter significant ore zone intercepts  strides in understanding the geology and genesis of the butte highlands gold mineralization were achieved 
timberline is being carried to production and is a joint venture partner in the butte highlands joint venture 
underground development continues on the project  with underground definition drilling commencing subsequent to september  for the remainder of and early  work is to continue on up to  feet of underground ramps   feet of underground core and rc drilling  and a  ton bulk sample  all of which is being funded by the company s joint venture partner 
the required application has been submitted for a hard rock operating permit at butte highlands  and work is continuing on the other associated permits required for the operation 
no material permitting obstacles are expected as the project advances toward targeted production 
surface facilities and infrastructure required for development and production are already in place under the company s exploration permit which has been in place since august butte highlands is expecting to produce gold commencing in early q  with the company s share expected to be approximately  ounces of gold per annum over the projected mine life of ten years based upon the preliminary internal operations plan for butte highlands 
all mine plan information is based on company internal analysis such that detailed figures are non compliant 
as part of the current program of work  the company intends to prepare and file a ni report by the end of june  timberline s butte highlands joint venture is the first example of the company s strategy to enter into creative structures that move production responsibility to other parties while allowing exposure to gold production  where financing has been provided by a third party with proven expertise in underground mine development and operation 
this has been achieved with no dilution to timberline shareholders 
as noted  all expenditures relating to the development of the projected underground mine are being paid by timberline s joint venture partner  with a total expected development budget of usd million 
our management and geologists remain committed to providing exploration and potential for discovery to our investors 
looking ahead  it is the opinion of management that our primary commodity focus should be on gold  and to a lesser extent on silver in the precious metals area 
furthermore  we believe that projects similar to lookout mountain and butte highlands are a good fit for the current environment and the unique qualifications of our people  drilling subsidiaries and strategic partners 
results of operations for years ended september  and consolidated results us year ended september revenue gross profit net income loss from continuing operations timberline corporate exploration timberline drilling consolidated net loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of tax consolidated net loss our revenues are derived entirely from our drilling subsidiary 
our revenue increase from the previous year was primarily due to an increase in the number of drill rigs in service during the year 
the improvement in gross profits compared to the prior year is a function of productivity improvements which have led to higher revenues per foot drilled and higher average footage drilled by each operating drill rig  the implementation of processes and controls that have reduced operating costs  and improved retention of skilled labor 
our overall consolidated net loss for the year decreased in comparison to the prior year primarily as a result of a greater than million improvement in net income from timberline drilling and a reduction in salaries  benefits and professional expenses  offset by a nearly million increase in mineral exploration expenses by the company

the income tax benefit during the year ended september  arose as a result of a reduction in deferred income tax liabilities assumed upon the acquisition of staccato gold resources ltd 
exploration expenses increased significantly from the previous year as a result of exploration drilling undertaken in at our butte highlands property  as well as our acquisition of the south eureka lookout mountain property in june non cash expenses decreased significantly in compared to the prior year as a result of a reduced value of stock options vesting during the current year 
timberline drilling us year ended september total revenue less elimination of intersegment revenues revenue gross profit general and administrative expenses interest and other expense  net net income loss timberline drilling s increase in revenue is attributable to a significantly higher utilization rate of our drill rigs  primarily due to our major customer increasing the number of drills required and an increase in exploration drilling 
overall the demand for drilling services appears to have stabilized during the past year 
junior resource and exploration stage companies are gaining access to capital for their drilling programs  and  as a result  the overall demand for drilling services  while not as robust as in and  continues to show signs of improvement 
timberline drilling has secured several new contracts with exploration stage companies 
the improvement in gross profits compared to the prior year is a function of productivity improvements which have led to higher revenues per foot drilled and higher average footage drilled by each operating drill rig  the implementation of processes and control s that have reduced operating costs  and improved retention of skilled labor 
increased year over year general and administrative expenses at timberline drilling reflect an expected increase in overhead costs to support the increased number of operating drill rigs as compared to the previous year 
the general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  also included a  recovery of severance expenses accrued in the prior year 
interest and other expenses decreased considerably in the year ending september  compared to the prior year  as the company incurred irs interest charges on unpaid payroll taxes in the prior year

financial condition and liquidity at september   we had assets of  consisting of cash in the amount of  restricted cash of  accounts receivable in the amount of  materials and supplies inventory valued at  property  mineral rights  and equipment  net of depreciation of  goodwill related to the acquisition of timberline drilling in the amount of  and other assets of disruptions in the current credit and financial markets have had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies 
while access to capital has improved recently  these disruptions could  among other things  make it more difficult for us to obtain  or increase our cost of obtaining  capital and financing for our operations 
our access to additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we expect to rely upon the revenues generated by our contract core drilling services subsidiary 
while the recent economic instability makes it difficult for the company s management to accurately predict revenues from these services into the fiscal year  management expects that if commodity prices for gold and silver remain at or near the levels seen in fiscal that our revenues will increase in step with increased demand for drilling services by both our current customers as well as new customers  while we expect cash flows from our contract core drilling services subsidiary to increase in fiscal if our revenues increase  if cash flows decline or are insufficient to fund our expenditures  our discretionary exploration activities and other operations will either be curtailed significantly or we will be reliant upon equity financings to continue our exploration activities into the future 
the curre nt market conditions could make it difficult or impossible for us to raise necessary funds to meet our capital requirements 
if we are unable to obtain financing through equity investments  we will seek multiple solutions including  but not limited to  asset sales  credit facilities or debenture issuances 
at september  the company has working capital of  compared to working capital of  at september  management expects to continue to maintain or increase the amount of working capital via continued improvements in operating cash flows at the company s drilling subsidiary  monitoring discretionary exploration expenditures  reducing professional and consulting expenses  and potentially obtaining financing through equity investments 
management expects to maintain or improve operating cash flows at the company s drilling subsidiary by increasing the utilization rate of our drills and closely managing payroll expenses  supplies inventory levels  and general and administrative costs 
we plan to continue exploration programs on our material exploration properties  to fund some exploratory activities and drilling on early stage properties  and to seek additional acquisition opportunities 
nbs p  during the year ended september   due to declining operational and financial results  we decided to cease the operations of timberline drilling s wholly owned mexican contract core drilling subsidiary  world wide exploration 
for additional information regarding the operating  investing and financing cash flows associated with our discontinued operations  please refer to note to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
the closure of our mexican operations is not expected to have a material impact on the company s cash flows in future periods 
as a result of our current cash balance  improved performance of our drilling subsidiary and our ability to curtail discretionary exploration expenditures as needed  management believes that it has sufficient working capital to meet the company s ongoing operating expenses for the next months 
additional financing may be required if the company seeks to undertake further property acquisitions or expand its exploration or drilling services operations 

table of contents financing activities in october  warrants to purchase  common shares of the company were exercised by warrant holders at a price of per common share  for aggregate total proceeds of  proceeds from the warrant exercises were used for general working capital and to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities in mining services and exploration

the company sold a total of  units for gross p roceeds of  with the private placement closing on november  proceeds from the private placement were used for general working capital and to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities in mining services and exploration 
on october  the company entered into a convertible note with small mine development smd  a company owned by ron guill  a director of the company 
the convertible note has a principal amount of million and is collateralized by a pledge of all of the stock of timberline drilling  inc  as well as a deed of trust covering the company s butte highlands property in silver bow county  montana the butte highlands property 
the convertible note bears interest at annually  compounded monthly  with interest payments due at maturity on october  the convertible note  including accrued interest  is convertible into common stock by smd at any time prior to payment of the note in full  at a conversion price of per share 
should the company issue any form of equity security other than the company s common stock  smd may also convert all or any portion of the outstanding amount under the convertible term note into the new form of equity security at the issuance price of the new form of equity security 
the convertible note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty 
if the company defaults on the convertible note  smd may declare the convertible note immediately due and payable  and the company must pay smd an origination fee in the amount of  in june  smd agreed to extend the maturity date of the convertible note to on or before april  all interest accrued through june  was paid by the company to smd at that time 
the company also paid a  extension fee to smd in consideration for the extension of the convertible note 
the convertible note was also amended to require interest accrued subsequent to june  to be paid by the company to smd monthly  rather than accruing interest to maturity

in addition  the company granted smd a right to develop the butte highlands property on the same terms as those of any bona fide offer to develop the property from a third party upon days notice from the company of any such offer 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures 
critical accounting policies and estimates see note to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for a complete summary of the significant accounting policies used in the presentation of our financial statements 
as described in note  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are related to asset impairments  asset retirement obligations  and inventory net realizable value 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows asset impairments significant property acquisition payments for active exploration properties are capitalized 
the evaluation of our mineral properties for impairment is based on market conditions for minerals  underlying mineralized material associated with the properties  and future costs that may be required for ultimate realization through mining operations or by sale 
if no mineable ore body is discovered  or market conditions for minerals deteriorate  there is the potential for a material adjustment to the value assigned to mineral properties 
the company reviews the carrying value of equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  the manner in which the equipment is used  and the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors 

table of contents asset retirement obligations the company has an obligation to reclaim its properties after the surface has been disturbed by exploration methods at the site 
as a result we have recorded a liability for the fair value of the reclamation costs we expects to incur in association with our joint venture at the butte highlands gold project 
the company estimated applicable inflation and credit adjusted risk free rates as well as expected reclamation time frames 
to the extent that the estimated reclamation costs change  such changes will impact future reclamation expense recorded 
a liability is recognized for the present value of estimated environmental remediation asset retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the offsetting balance is charged to the related long lived asset 
adjustments are made to the liability for changes resulting from passage of time and changes to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate underlying the obligation 
materials and supplies inventory inventories consist primarily of parts  operating supplies  drill rods and drill bits 
the company values its materials and supplies inventory  with the exception of drill rods  at the lower of average cost or market 
drill rods are valued using their average cost less an allowance for rod usage on a per foot drilled basis 
the company reviews the carrying value of inventory for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that materials and supplies inventory may no longer be of use by the company s drilling operation 
the company also periodically assesses the per foot allowance for drill rod usage by assessing the net carrying value of rod inventory relative to the operating condition of rod inventory held by the company 
allowances are recorded for inventory considered to be in excess or obsolete 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the asc guidance for subsequent events was updated to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
this statement is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  accordingly  the company adopted the updated guidance in its quarter ending june  the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the asc guidance for consolidation accounting was updated to require an analysis to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this statement requires an ongoing reassessment and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining whether an entity is the primary beneficiary 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after nov 
 accordingly  the company will adopt this updated guidance in fiscal year and is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the consolidated financial statements 
in january  the asc guidance for fair value measurements was updated to require additional disclosures related to movements of assets among levels and of the three tier fair value hierarchy 
also  a reconciliation of purchases  sales  issuance  and settlements of anything valued with a level method is required 
disclosure regarding fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities will be required 
the updated guidance was adopted by the company in its quarter ending december   except for disclosures about the activity in level fair value measurements which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
adoption of this updated guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations a substantial portion of the company s core drill purchases are financed through capital leases 
payments for the fiscal year ending september  under these capital leases were  the following fiscal year payments are due under these leases      and  
timberline drilling also owns a fleet of vehicles  trucks and fork lifts  as well as land and a building  for its drilling operations 
other equipment  vehicles and property were financed with notes collateralized by the equipment  vehicles or property 
payments for the fiscal year ending september  under these notes were  the following fiscal year payments are due under these financing arrangements       and  
timberline and its subsidiaries lease office space and storage facilities 
all of these facilities  which we believe are adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future  are leased 
under the current leases  we paid rental payments of  in the fiscal year ending september  the current leases call for the following fiscal year payments     and
