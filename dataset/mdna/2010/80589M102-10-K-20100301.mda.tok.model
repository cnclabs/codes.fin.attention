item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview scana  through its wholly owned regulated subsidiaries  is primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in parts of south carolina and in the purchase  transmission and sale of natural gas in portions of north carolina and south carolina 
through a wholly owned nonregulated subsidiary  scana markets natural gas to retail customers in georgia and to wholesale customers primarily in the southeast 
other wholly owned nonregulated subsidiaries provide fiber optic and other telecommunications services and provide service contracts to homeowners on certain home appliances and heating and air conditioning units 
a service company subsidiary of scana provides administrative  management and other services to scana and its subsidiaries 
the following map indicates areas where the company s significant business segments conduct their activities  as further described in this overview section

of revenues regulated nonregulated of income available to common shareholders regulated nonregulated of assets regulated nonregulated key earnings drivers and outlook during  the southeast continued to suffer from the effects of the recession 
at december  preliminary estimates of seasonally adjusted unemployment for the states in which the company primarily provides service were in georgia  in north carolina and in south carolina 
these rates are significantly higher than rates at december  customer growth rates remained positive  but sluggish  throughout in most regulated business segments 
in addition  the regulated business segments continued to experience declines in customer usage 
our nonregulated natural gas marketer in georgia experienced a slight reduction in retail customers during the year as intense competition and economic distress continued 
the company expects that any economic recovery will be slow in  and cannot determine when or if customer growth and usage trends may return to pre levels 
over the next five years  key earnings drivers for the company will be additions to rate base at south carolina electric gas company sce g  carolina gas transmission corporation cgt and public service company of north carolina  incorporated psnc energy  consisting primarily of capital expenditures for environmental facilities  new generating capacity and system expansion 
other factors that will impact future earnings growth include the regulatory environment  customer growth and usage in each of the regulated utility businesses  earnings in the natural gas marketing business in georgia and the level of growth of operation and maintenance expenses and taxes 
electric operations the electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of sce g  south carolina generating company  inc genco and south carolina fuel company  inc fuel company  and is primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in south carolina 
at december  sce g provided electricity to approximately  customers in an area covering nearly  square miles 
genco owns a coal fired generating station and sells electricity solely to sce g 
fuel company acquires  owns and provides financing for sce g s nuclear fuel  fossil fuel and emission allowance requirements 
operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity  the ability to control costs and rates allowed to be charged to customers 
embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity 
sce g s allowed return on equity is 
demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather  customer growth and the economy 
sce g is able to recover the cost of fuel used in electric generation through retail customers bills  but increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and  therefore  the competitive position of electricity against other energy sources 
in  sce g contracted with westinghouse electric company llc and stone webster  inc for the design and construction of two  megawatt nuclear electric generating units at the site of v 
c 
summer nuclear station summer station 
sce g and south carolina public service authority santee cooper will be joint owners and share operating costs and generation output of the units  with sce g accounting for percent of the cost and output and santee cooper the remaining percent 
assuming timely receipt of federal approvals and construction proceeding as scheduled  the first unit is expected to be completed and in service in  and the second in the successful completion of the project would result in an increase of the company s utility plant in service of approximately over its level 
financing and managing the construction of these plants  together with continuing environmental construction projects  represents a significant challenge to the company 

table of contents in february  the scpsc approved sce g s combined application pursuant to the base load review act the blra seeking a certificate of environmental compatibility and public convenience and necessity and for a base load review order relating to proposed construction and operation by sce g and santee cooper of two new nuclear generating units at summer station 
under the blra  the scpsc conducted a full pre construction prudency review of the proposed units and the engineering  procurement  and construction contract under which they are being built 
the scpsc prudency finding is binding on all future related rate proceedings so long as the construction proceeds in accordance with schedules  estimates and projections  including contingencies  as approved by the scpsc 
as part of its order  the scpsc approved the initial rate increase of million  or  related to recovery of the cost of capital on project expenditures through june   and the revised rates became effective for bills rendered on and after march  in addition  sce g is allowed to file revised rates with the scpsc each year to incorporate the financing cost of any incremental construction work in progress incurred for new nuclear generation 
requested rate adjustments are based on sce g s updated cost of debt and capital structure and on an allowed return on common equity of 
in may  two intervenors filed separate appeals of the order one of which challenged the scpsc s prudency finding with the south carolina supreme court 
a hearing for one appeal is set for march   and the hearing for the other appeal has not been set 
sce g cannot predict how or when the appeals will be resolved 
in september  the scpsc approved sce g s first annual revised rate request under the blra which constituted a million or increase to retail electric rates 
in january  the scpsc approved sce g s request under the blra to approve an updated construction and capital cost schedule for the new units 
the revised schedule does not change the previously announced completion date for the new units or the originally announced cost 
in march  sce g and santee cooper filed an application with the nuclear regulatory commission nrc for a combined construction and operating license col 
this col application for the two new units was reviewed for completeness by the nrc and docketed on july  in september the nrc issued a month review schedule from the docketing date to the issuance of the safety evaluation report which would signify satisfactory completion of their review 
both the environmental and safety reviews by the nrc are in progress and should support a col issuance in late or early this date would support both the project schedule and the substantial completion dates for the two new units in and  respectively 
the company expects that significant legislative or regulatory initiatives regarding energy  will be undertaken  particularly at the federal level 
these initiatives may require the company to build or otherwise acquire generating capacity from energy sources that exclude fossil fuels  nuclear or hydro facilities for example  under a renewable portfolio standard or rps 
new legislation or regulations may also impose stringent requirements on existing power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxides and mercury 
it is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 
the company cannot predict whether such legislation or regulations will be enacted  and if they are  the conditions they would impose on utilities 
the epa has publicly stated its intention to propose new federal regulations affecting the management and disposal of coal combustion products ccp  such as ash  in such regulations could result in the treatment of some ccps as hazardous waste and could impose significant costs to utilities  such as sce g and genco 
while the company cannot predict how extensive the regulations will be  the company believes that any additional costs imposed by such regulations would be recoverable through rates 
gas distribution the gas distribution segment is comprised of the local distribution operations of sce g and psnc energy and is primarily engaged in the purchase  transmission and sale of natural gas to retail customers in portions of north carolina and south carolina 
at december  this segment provided natural gas to approximately  customers in areas covering  square miles 
operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas  the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers 
embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity 
demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather  customer growth  the economy and  for commercial and industrial customers  the availability and price of alternate fuels 
natural gas competes with electricity  propane and heating oil to serve the heating and  to a lesser extent  other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers 
this competition is generally based on price and convenience 
large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel  such as propane or fuel oil 
natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price 
as a result  any significant disparity between supply and demand  either of natural gas or of alternate fuels  and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors  will affect price and impact the company s ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers 
significant supply disruptions occurred in september and october as a result of hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico  resulting in the curtailment during the period of most large commercial and industrial customers with interruptible supply agreements 
while significant supply disruptions have not been experienced since  the price of natural gas remains volatile 
due to the recession  demand for natural gas has decreased overall  resulting in significantly lower prices for this commodity in the long term impact of volatile gas prices and gas supply has not been determined 

table of contents gas transmission cgt operates an open access  transportation only interstate pipeline company regulated by the united states federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
cgt s operating results are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas  the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers 
demand for cgt s services is closely linked to demand for natural gas and is affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth 
cgt provides transportation services to sce g for its gas distribution customers and for certain electric generation needs and to scana energy marketing  inc semi for natural gas marketing 
cgt also provides transportation services to other natural gas utilities  municipalities and county gas authorities and to industrial customers 
retail gas marketing scana energy  a division of semi  comprises the retail gas marketing segment 
this segment markets natural gas to over  customers as of december   and includes regulated division customers described below throughout georgia 
scana energy s total customer base represents an approximately share of the customers in georgia s deregulated natural gas market 
scana energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in the state 
scana energy s competitors include affiliates of other large energy companies with experience in georgia s energy market  as well as several electric membership cooperatives 
scana energy s ability to maintain its market share depends on the prices it charges customers relative to the prices charged by its competitors  its ability to continue to provide high levels of customer service and other factors 
as georgia s regulated provider  scana energy provides service to low income customers and customers unable to obtain or maintain natural gas service from other marketers at rates approved by the georgia public service commission gpsc  and scana energy receives funding from the universal service fund to offset some of the bad debt associated with the low income group

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a part of this risk management process  at any given time  a portion of scana s projected natural gas needs has been purchased or otherwise placed under contract 
since scana energy operates in a competitive market  it may be unable to sustain its current levels of customers and or pricing  thereby reducing expected margins and profitability 
further  there can be no assurance that georgia s gas delivery regulatory framework will remain unchanged as dynamic market conditions evolve 
energy marketing the divisions of semi  excluding scana energy energy marketing  comprise the energy marketing segment 
this segment markets natural gas primarily in the southeast and provides energy related risk management services to customers 
the operating results for energy marketing are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas and the ability to control costs 
demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth

table of contents cash requirements for scana s regulated subsidiaries arise primarily from their operational needs  funding their construction programs and payment of dividends to scana 
the ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment  to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas and to install equipment necessary to comply with environmental regulations  will depend on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms 
regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers 
rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs 
as customer growth and inflation occur and these subsidiaries continue their ongoing construction programs  rate increases will be sought 
the future financial position and results of operations of the regulated subsidiaries will be affected by their ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief 
the company also obtains equity from scana s stock plans 
shares of scana common stock are acquired on behalf of participants in scana s investor plus plan and stock purchase savings plan through original issue shares  rather than on the open market

in december  sce g issued million of first mortgage bonds bearing an annual interest rate of and maturing on december  proceeds from the sale were used to finance capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes 
in november  scana issued million of enhanced junior subordinated notes hybrids bearing an interest rate of and maturing on january   subject to extension to january  because their structure and terms are characteristic of both debt instruments and equity securities  the rating agencies consider securities like the hybrids to be hybrid debt instruments and give some equity credit to the issuers of such securities for purposes of computing leverage ratios 
the hybrids are only subject to redemption at scana s option and may be redeemed at any time  although the redemption prices payable by scana differ depending on the timing of the redemption and the circumstances if any giving rise thereto 
proceeds from the hybrids were used to provide sce g funds to redeem all of its outstanding shares of preferred stock and for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the issuance of the hybrids  scana executed a replacement capital covenant rcc in favor of the holders of certain designated debt referred to as covered debt 
under the terms of the rcc  scana agreed not to redeem or repurchase all or part of the hybrids prior to the termination date of the rcc  unless it uses the proceeds of certain qualifying securities sold to non affiliates within days prior to the redemption or repurchase date 
the proceeds scana receives from such qualifying securities  adjusted by a predetermined factor  must exceed the redemption or repurchase price of the hybrids 
qualifying securities include common stock  and other securities that generally rank equal to or junior to the hybrids and include distribution  deferral and long dated maturity features similar to the hybrids

table of contents environmental matters the company s regulated operations are subject to extensive regulation by various federal and state authorities in the areas of air quality  water quality  control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes 
applicable statutes and rules include the clean air act  as amended caa  the clean air interstate rule cair  the clean water act cwa  the nuclear waste policy act of nuclear waste act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  among others 
compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs  which the company expects to recover through existing ratemaking provisions 
for the three years ended december   the company s capital expenditures for environmental control totaled million 
these expenditures were in addition to environmental expenditures included in other operation and maintenance expenses  which were million during  million during  and million during it is not possible to estimate all future costs related to environmental matters  but forecasts for capitalized environmental expenditures for the company are million for and million for the four year period these expenditures are included in the company s estimated capital expenditures table  are discussed in liquidity and capital resources  and include known costs related to the matters discussed below 
on june   the united states house of representatives narrowly passed energy legislation that would mandate significant reductions in greenhouse gas ghg emissions and require electric utilities to generate an increasing percentage of their power from renewable sources 
the bill would require  among other things  that ghg emissions be reduced to below levels by  and to below levels by companies could meet these standards either through emission reductions or by obtaining emission allowances cap and trade 
the bill also would impose a renewable energy standard res on the total generation of electric utilities beginning at in and increasing to by new nuclear generation would be excluded from the res total generation baseline calculation  and one quarter of the res mandate could be met through energy efficiency measures 
the united states senate is also considering legislation that would address ghg emissions and would establish an res 
the company cannot predict if or when the legislation described above will become law or what requirements would be imposed on the company by such legislation 
the company expects that any costs incurred to comply with such legislation would be recoverable through rates 
at the state level  no significant environmental legislation that would affect the company s operations advanced during the company cannot predict whether such legislation will be introduced or enacted in  or if new regulations or changes to existing regulations at the state or federal level will be implemented in the coming year 
air quality with the pervasive emergence of concern over the issue of global climate change as a significant influence upon the economy  scana  sce g and genco are subject to certain climate related financial risks  including those involving regulatory requirements responsive to ghg emissions  as well as those involving physical impacts which could arise from global climate change 
certain other business and financial risks arising from such climate change could also arise 
the company cannot predict all of the climate related regulatory and physical risks nor the related consequences which might impact the company  and the following discussion should not be considered all inclusive 
from a regulatory perspective  scana  sce g and genco continually monitor and evaluate their current and projected emission levels and strive to comply with all state and federal regulations regarding those emissions 
sce g and genco participate in the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission allowance programs with respect to coal plant emissions and also have constructed additional pollution control equipment at several larger coal fired electric generating plants 
further  sce g has announced plans to construct two new nuclear generating plants which are expected to significantly reduce ghg emission levels once they are completed and dispatched  potentially displacing some of the current coal fired generation sources 
see also the discussion of the court action on the cair below 
even while the rule has been in flux  the company has continued with its scrubber and selective catalytic reactor scr construction projects with the expectation that new rules will be forthcoming 
in  the epa issued the cair which requires the district of columbia and states  including south carolina  to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in order to attain mandated state levels 
cair set emission limits to be met in two phases beginning in and  respectively  for nitrogen oxide and beginning in and  respectively  for sulfur dioxide 
numerous states  environmental organizations  industry groups and individual companies challenged the rule  seeking a change in the method cair used to allocate sulfur dioxide emission allowances 
on december   the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit remanded the rule but did not vacate it 
prior to the court of appeals decision  sce g and genco had determined that additional air quality controls would be needed to meet the cair requirements 
sce g has completed the installation of scr technology at cope station for nitrogen oxide reduction and genco has completed installation of a wet limestone scrubber at williams station for sulfur dioxide reduction 
sce g also is installing a wet limestone scrubber at wateree station 
the company expects to incur capital expenditures totaling approximately million 
table of contents through for these scrubber projects  of which approximately million has already been spent 
the company cannot predict when the epa will issue a revised rule or what impact the rule will have on sce g and genco 
any costs incurred to comply with this rule or other rules issued by the epa in the future are expected to be recoverable through rates 
physical effects associated with climate changes could include the impact of possible changes in weather patterns  such as storm frequency and intensity  and the resultant potential damage to the company s electric system  as well as impacts on customers and on the company s supply chain and many others 
much of the service territory of sce g is subject to the damaging effects of atlantic and gulf coast hurricanes and also to the damaging impact of winter ice storms 
to help mitigate the financial risks arising from these potential occurrences  sce g maintains insurance on certain properties and also collects funds from customers for its storm damage reserve see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as part of its ongoing operations  sce g maintains emergency response and storm preparation plans and teams  and applicable personnel participate in ongoing training and related simulations in advance of such storms  all in order to allow the company to protect its assets and to return its systems to normal reliable operation in a timely fashion following any such event 
in december the epa issued a final finding that atmospheric concentrations of ghg endanger public health and welfare within the meaning of section a of the caa 
the rule  which became effective in january  enables the epa to regulate ghg emissions under the caa 
the epa has committed to issue new rules regulating such emissions by november on september   the epa issued a proposed rule that would require facilities emitting over  tons of ghg a year such as sce g s generating facilities to obtain permits demonstrating that they are using the best practices and technologies to minimize ghg emissions 
the company expects that any costs incurred to comply with ghg emission requirements will be recoverable through rates 
in the epa issued the clean air mercury rule camr which established a mercury emissions cap and trade program for coal fired power plants 
numerous parties challenged the rule  and on february   the united states circuit court for the district of columbia vacated the rule for electric utility steam generating units 
the company expects the epa to issue a new mercury emissions rule but cannot predict when such a rule will be issued or what requirements it will impose 
the epa is conducting an enforcement initiative against the utilities industry related to the new source review provisions and the new source performance standards of the caa 
as part of the initiative  many utilities have received requests for information under section of the caa 
in addition  the united states department of justice doj  on behalf of epa  has taken civil enforcement action against several utilities 
the primary basis for these actions is the assertion by epa that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities at their coal fired power plants constituted major modifications which required the installation of costly bact 
some of the utilities subject to the actions have reached settlement 
to date  sce g and genco have received and responded to section requests for information related to canadys  wateree and williams stations 
the current state of continued doj civil enforcement is the subject of industry wide speculation  and it cannot be determined whether the company will be affected by the initiative in the future 
the company believes that any enforcement action relative to its compliance with the caa would be without merit 
the company further believes that installation of equipment responsive to cair previously discussed will mitigate many of the alleged concerns with new source review nsr 
water quality the clean water act  as amended cwa  provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges 
under the cwa  compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program 
discharge permits have been issued for all  and renewed for all  of sce g s and genco s generating units 
concurrent with renewal of these permits  the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling discharges  has modified the requirements for cooling water intake structures  and has required strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams 
the company is conducting studies and is developing or implementing compliance plans for these initiatives 
congress is expected to consider further amendments to the cwa 
such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones and toxicity based standards 
these provisions  if passed  could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the company  sce g and genco 
the company believes that any additional costs imposed by such regulations would be recoverable through rates 
hazardous and solid wastes the epa has publicly stated its intention to propose new federal regulations affecting the management and disposal of coal combustion products ccp  such as ash  in such regulations could result in the treatment of some ccps as hazardous waste and could impose significant costs to utilities  such as sce g and genco 
while the company cannot predict how extensive the regulations will be  the company believes that any additional costs imposed by such regulations would be recoverable through rates 

table of contents the nuclear waste act required that the united states government accept and permanently dispose of high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel by january  the nuclear waste act also imposed on utilities the primary responsibility for storage of their spent nuclear fuel until the repository is available 
sce g entered into a standard contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel and or high level radioactive waste with the united states department of energy doe in as of december   the federal government has not accepted any spent fuel from summer station or any other nuclear generating facility  and it remains unclear when the repository may become available 
sce g has on site spent nuclear fuel storage capability until at least and expects to be able to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel output for the life of summer station through dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available 
the provisions of cercla authorize the epa to require the clean up of hazardous waste sites 
in addition  the states of south carolina and north carolina have similar laws 
the company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental clean up 
in addition  regulators from the epa and other federal or state agencies periodically notify the company that it may be required to perform or participate in the investigation and remediation of a hazardous waste site 
as site assessments are initiated  estimates are made of the amount of expenditures  if any  deemed necessary to investigate and remediate each site 
these estimates are refined as additional information becomes available  therefore  actual expenditures may differ significantly from the original estimates 
amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and clean up relate solely to regulated operations 
such amounts are recorded in deferred debits and amortized  with recovery provided through rates 
the company has assessed the following matters electric operations sce g has been named  along with others  by the epa as a potentially responsible party prp at the alternate energy resources  inc aer superfund site located in augusta  georgia 
the epa placed the site on the national priorities list in april aer conducted hazardous waste storage and treatment operations from to  when the site was abandoned 
while operational  aer processed fuels from waste oils  treated industrial coolants and oil water emulsions  recycled solvents and blended hazardous waste fuels 
during that time  sce g occasionally used aer for the processing of waste solvents  oily rags and oily wastewater 
the epa and the state of georgia have documented that a release or releases have occurred at the site leading to contamination of groundwater  surface water and soils 
the epa and the state of georgia have conducted a preliminary assessment and site inspection 
the prps funded a remedial investigation and risk assessment which was completed and approved by the epa  and funded a feasibility study that is expected to be completed in the site has not been remediated nor has a clean up cost been estimated 
although a basis for the allocation of clean up costs among the prps is unclear  sce g does not believe that its involvement at this site would result in an allocation of costs that would have a material adverse impact on its results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
any cost allocated to sce g arising from the remediation of this site  net of insurance recovery  is expected to be recoverable through rates 
gas distribution sce g is responsible for four decommissioned manufactured gas plant mgp sites in south carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals 
these sites are in various stages of investigation  remediation and monitoring under work plans approved by the south carolina department of health and environmental control dhec 
sce g anticipates that major remediation activities at these sites will continue until and will cost an additional million 
in addition  the national park service of the department of the interior has made an initial demand to sce g for payment of million for certain costs and damages relating to the mgp site in charleston  south carolina 
sce g expects to recover any cost arising from the remediation of these four sites  net of insurance recovery  through rates 
at december   deferred amounts  net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements  totaled million 
psnc energy is responsible for environmental clean up at five sites in north carolina on which mgp residuals are present or suspected 
psnc energy s actual remediation costs for these sites will depend on a number of factors  such as actual site conditions  third party claims and recoveries from other prps 
psnc energy has recorded a liability and associated regulatory asset of million  the estimated remaining liability at december  psnc energy expects to recover through rates any costs allocable to psnc energy arising from the remediation of these sites 
regulatory matters material retail rate proceedings are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
south carolina electric gas company sce g is subject to the jurisdiction of the sec as to the issuance of certain securities and other matters  the scpsc as to retail electric and gas rates  service  accounting  issuance of securities other than short term borrowings and other matters  and ferc as to issuance of short term borrowings  certain acquisitions and other matters

natural gas distribution companies may request annual adjustments to rates to reflect changes in revenues and expenses and changes in investment 
such annual adjustments are subject to certain qualifying criteria and review by the scpsc 
effective february  the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration issued a final rule establishing integrity management requirements for gas distribution pipeline systems  similar to those for transmission pipelines discussed below 
the rule gives sce g until august  to develop and implement a program for compliance with the rule 
sce g has not determined what impact the rule will have on its operations 
sce g believes that any additional cost incurred to comply with the rule will be recoverable through rates 
public service company of north carolina  incorporated psnc energy is subject to the jurisdiction of the ncuc as to gas rates  issuance of securities other than notes with a maturity of two years or less or renewals of notes with a maturity of six years or less  accounting and other matters 
the pipeline safety improvement act of the pipeline safety act  directed the united states department of transportation dot to establish the integrity management rule for operations of natural gas systems with transmission pipelines located near moderate to high density populations 
of psnc energy s approximately miles of transmission pipeline subject to the pipeline safety act  miles are located within these areas 
through december  psnc energy has assessed percent of the pipeline and is required to complete its assessment of the remainder by december depending on the assessment method used  psnc energy will be required to reinspect these same miles of pipeline approximately every seven years 
psnc energy currently estimates the total cost through december to be million for the initial assessments  not including any subsequent remediation that may be required 
costs totaling million are being recovered through rates over a three year period beginning november  the ncuc has authorized continuation of deferral accounting for certain expenses incurred to comply with dot s pipeline integrity management requirements until resolution of psnc energy s next general rate proceeding 
carolina gas transmission corporation cgt has approximately miles of transmission line that are covered by the integrity management rule of the pipeline safety act 
cgt currently estimates the total cost to be million for the initial assessments and any subsequent remediation required through december critical accounting policies and estimates following are descriptions of the company s accounting policies and estimates which are most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations 
utility regulation scana s regulated utilities record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods in accordance with accounting guidance for rate regulated utilities 
in the future  as a result of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment  the company may no longer meet the criteria of accounting for rate regulated utilities  and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  liquidity or financial position of the company s and sce g s electric distribution and gas distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s regulatory assets and liabilities  including those associated with the company s environmental assessment program 
the company s generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market 
if market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs  the company could be required to write down its investment in those assets 
the company cannot predict whether any write downs will be necessary and  if they are  the extent to which they would adversely affect the company s results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded 
as of december   the company s net investments in fossil hydro and nuclear generation assets were approximately billion and billion  respectively 
revenue recognition and unbilled revenues revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers 
because customers of the company s utilities and retail gas operations are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters  the company records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period 
such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last 
table of contents reading of their meters 
such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class  the effects of different rate schedules  changes in weather and  where applicable  the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures 
the accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs 
accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of million at december  and million at december   compared to total revenues of billion and billion for the years and  respectively 
nuclear decommissioning accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future 
among the factors that could change sce g s accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology  changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements  and changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows 
changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact the company s financial position and cash flows although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral  because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers 
sce g s two thirds share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for summer station  including both the cost of decommissioning plant components that are and are not subject to radioactive contamination  totals million  stated in dollars 
santee cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in summer station 
the cost estimate assumes that the site would be maintained over a period of years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that would permit release for unrestricted use 
under sce g s method of funding decommissioning costs  amounts collected through rates are invested in insurance policies on the lives of certain company personnel 
sce g transfers to an external trust fund the amounts collected through electric rates  insurance proceeds and interest thereon  less expenses 
the trusteed asset balance reflects the net cash surrender value of the insurance policies and cash held by the trust 
management intends for the fund  including earnings thereon  to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits the company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and changes in funded status as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  or as a regulatory asset as required by accounting guidance 
the company s plan is adequately funded under current regulations 
accounting guidance requires the use of several assumptions  the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting pension cost or income recorded 
among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and expected returns on assets 
net pension cost of million recorded in reflects the use of a discount rate  derived using a cash flow matching technique  and an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets 
the company believes that these assumptions were  and that the resulting pension cost amount was  reasonable 
for purposes of comparison  using a discount rate of in would have increased the company s pension cost by million 
had the assumed long term rate of return on assets been  the company s pension cost for would have increased by million 
the following information with respect to pension assets and returns thereon should also be noted 
the company determines the fair value of a majority of its pension assets utilizing market quotes or derives them from modeling techniques that incorporate market data 
only a small portion of assets are valued using less transparent so called level methods 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumptions  the company evaluates historical performance  targeted allocation amounts and expected payment terms 
as of the beginning of  the plan s historical   and year cumulative performance showed actual returns of   and  respectively 
the expected long term rate of return of was based on a target asset allocation of with equity managers and with fixed income managers 
management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate 
for  the expected rate of return is also 
as noted in results of operations above  due to turmoil in the financial markets and the resultant declines in plan asset values in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded significant amounts of pension cost in compared to the pension income recorded in and previously 
however  in february  the company was granted accounting orders by the scpsc which allow it to mitigate a significant portion of this increased pension expense by deferring as a regulatory asset the amount of pension expense above the level of pension income which is included in current rates for both of the company s south carolina regulated businesses 
these costs will be deferred until future rate filings  at which time the accumulated deferred costs will be addressed prospectively 

table of contents the pension trust is adequately funded under current regulations  and no contributions have been required since management does not anticipate the need to make pension contributions until after the company accounts for the cost of its postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans in a similar manner to that used for its defined benefit pension plan 
this plan is unfunded  so no assumptions related to rate of return on assets impact the net expense recorded  however  the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense 
the company used a discount rate of  derived using a cash flow matching technique  and recorded a net cost of million for had the selected discount rate been  the expense for would have been million higher 
because the plan provisions include caps on company per capita costs  healthcare cost inflation rate assumptions do not materially impact the net expense recorded 
asset retirement obligations the company accrues for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from their acquisition  construction  development and normal operation in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
the obligations are recognized at fair value in the period in which they are incurred  and associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as a part of the carrying amount of the related long lived assets 
because such obligations relate primarily to the company s regulated utility operations  their recording has no significant impact on results of operations 
as of december   the company has recorded an asset retirement obligation aro of million for nuclear plant decommissioning as discussed above and an aro of million for other conditional obligations related to generation  transmission and distribution properties  including gas pipelines 
all of the amounts recorded in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance are based upon estimates which are subject to varying degrees of imprecision  particularly since such payments will be made many years in the future 
changes in these estimates will be recorded over time  however  these changes in estimates are not expected to materially impact results of operations so long as the regulatory framework for the company s utilities remains in place 
other matters off balance sheet transactions although scana invests in securities and business ventures  it does not hold significant investments in unconsolidated special purpose entities 
scana does not engage in off balance sheet financing or similar transactions  although it is party to incidental operating leases in the normal course of business  generally for office space  furniture  equipment and rail cars
