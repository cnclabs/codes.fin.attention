we are globally positioned in terms of manufacturing operations 
in the united states  our manufacturing operations are located in michigan  georgia  iowa and wisconsin 
in europe  we have a manufacturing presence in the united kingdom  our largest marketplace outside of the united states 
in asia  we have manufacturing operations in ningbo  china 
we manufacture our products using a system of lean manufacturing techniques collectively referred to as the herman miller performance system hmps 
we strive to maintain efficiencies and cost savings by minimizing the amount of inventory on hand 
accordingly  production is order driven with direct materials and components purchased as needed to meet de mand 
the standard lead time for the majority of our products is to days 
these factors result in a high rate of inventory turns and typically cause our inventory levels to appear relatively low compared to our sales volume 
a key element of our manufacturing strategy is to limit fixed production costs by sourcing component parts from strategic suppliers 
this strategy has allowed us to increase the variable nature of our cost structure while retaining proprietary control over those production processes that we believe provide us a competitive advantage 
as a result of this strategy  our manufacturing operations are largely assembly based 
our business consists of various operating segments as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
these operating segments are determined on the basis of how we internally report and evaluate financial information used to make operating decisions and are organized by the various markets we serve 
for external reporting purposes  we aggregate these operating segments as follows 
north american furniture solutions includes the business associated with the design  manufacture  and sale of furniture products for office  learning and healthcare environments throughout the united states  canada  and mexico 
non north american furniture solutions includes the business associated with the design  manufacture  and sale of furniture products primarily for work related settings outside north america 
other includes our north american residential furniture business as well as other business activities such as convia  unallocated corporate expenses  and restructuring costs 
core strengths we rely on the following core strengths in delivering workplace solutions to our customers 
brand our b rand is recognized by customers as a pioneer in design and sustainability  and as an advocate that supports their needs and interests 
within our industry  herman miller is acknowledged as one of the leading brands that inspire architects and designers to create their best commercial design solutions 
leveraging our brand equity across our lines of business to extend our reach to customers and consumers is an important element of our business strategy 
problem solving design and innovation we are committed to developing research based functionality and aesthetically innovative new products and have a history of doing so 
we believe our skills and experience in matching problem solving design with the workplace needs of our customers provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
an important component of our business strategy is to actively pursue a program of new product research  design  and development 
we accomplish this through the use of an internal research  engineering  and design staff as well as third party design resources generally compensated on a royalty basis 
operational excellence we were among the first in our industry to embrace the concepts of lean manufacturing 
hmps provides the foundation for all of our manufacturing operations 
we are committed to continuously improving both product quality and production and operational efficiency 
we have extended this lean process work to our non manufacturing processes as well as externally to our manufacturing supply chain and distribution channel 
we believe this work holds great promise for further gains in reliability  quality and efficiency 
building and leading networks we value relationships in all areas of our business 
we consider our networks of innovative designers  owned and independent dealers  and suppliers to be among our mos t important competitive factors and vital to the long term success of our business 
channels of distribution our products and services are offered to most of our customers under standard trade credit terms between and days and are sold through the following distribution channels 
independent contract furniture dealers and licensees most of our product sales are made to a network of independently owned and operated contract furniture dealerships doing business in many countries around the world 
these dealers purchase our products and distribute them to end customers 
we recognize revenue on product sales through this channel once our products are shipped and title passes to the dealer 
many of these dealers also offer furniture related services  including product installation 
owned contract furniture dealers at may   we owned contract furniture dealerships  some of which have operations in multiple locations 
the financial results of these owned dealers are included in our consolidated financial stateme nts 
product sales to these dealerships are eliminated as inter company transactions from our consolidated financial results 
we recognize revenue on these sales once products are shipped to the end customer and installation is substantially complete 
we believe independent ownership of contract furniture dealers is generally the best model for a financially strong distribution network 
with this in mind  our strategy is to continue to pursue opportunities to transition our owned dealerships to independent owners 
where possible  our goal is to involve local managers in these ownership transitions 
direct customer sales we sometimes sell products and services directly to end customers without an intermediary eg sales to the us federal government 
in most of these instances  we contract separately with a dealership or third party installation company to provide sales related services 
we recognize revenue on these sales once products are shipped and installation is substantially complete 
independent retailers certain products are sold to end customers through independent retail operations 
revenue is recognized on these sales once products are shipped and title passes to the independent retailer 
challenges ahead like all businesses  we are faced with a host of challenges and risks 
we believe our core strengths and values  which provide the foundation for our strategic direction  have us well prepared to respond to the inevitable challenges we will face in the fut ure 
while we are confident in our direction  we acknowledge the risks specific to our business and industry 
refer to item a of our annual report on form k for discussion of certain of these risk factors 
future avenues of growth we believe we are well positioned to successfully pursue our mission in spite of the risks and challenges we face 
that is  we will design and develop furniture and related services and technologies that reflect sustainable business practices that improve your environment and help create a better world around you 
in pursuing our mission  we have identified the following as key avenues for our fut ure growth 
primary markets capture additional market share within our primary markets by offering superior solutions to customers who value space as a strategic tool 
adjacent markets further apply our core skills in space environments such as healthcare  higher education  and residential 
developing economies expand our geographic reach in areas of the world with significant growth potential 
new markets develop or acquire new products and technologies that serve new markets 
industry analysis the business and institutional furniture manufacturer s association bifma is the trade association for the us domestic office furniture industry 
we monitor the trade statist ics reported by bifma and consider them an indicator of industry wide sales and order performance 
bifma publishes statistical data for the contract segment and the office supply segment within the us furniture market 
the us contract segment is primarily with large to mid size corporations installed via a network of dealers 
the office supply segment is primarily to smaller customers via wholesalers and retailers 
we primarily participate  and are a leader in  the contract segment 
it is important to note that our diversification strategy lessens our dependence on the us office furniture market 
we also analyze bifma statistical information as a benchmark comparison against the performance of our domestic us business and also to that of our competitors 
the t iming of large project based business may affect comparisons to this data in any one period 
finally  bifma regularly provides its members with industry forecast information  which we use internally as one of several considerations in our short and long range planning process 
discussion of business conditions our fiscal years ended may  and may  each included weeks of operations 
fiscal was a year marked by economic challenge and strategic achievement 
for th e second year in a row sales decreased by percent and we were called upon to make tough choices to balance current profitability against future investments 
from an economic perspective  the macro drivers of demand in the contract office furniture industry have remained relatively soft with lagging office construction rates and reduced employment levels 
however  after finishing the year with two consecutive quarters of year over year order growth  it appears that our business is benefiting from some momentum in the broader economy 
apart from the overall economic challenges  we have made great progress this year toward our strategic goals 
despite lower sales relative to last year  we have remained solidly profitable  achieving an operating earnings of percent of sales for the full year 
we took action to de leverage our balance sheet in the first quarter through the early retirement of million of long term debt and then in the third quarter by partially funding our pension obligations 
as part of our continuing efforts to reduce fixed operating expenses  our operations team worked diligently toward the implementation of two factory consolidation projects  both of which were successfully concluded during the fourth quarter 
even in this challenging environment we have continued our focus on operational excellence with our manufacturing operations maintaining a reliability score above percent throughout the year 
at this year s neocon  the contract furniture industry s largest tradeshow  our new healthcare showroom was named the large showroom winner  and  for the fourth time in five years  we received the office f urniture dealers alliance ofda gold award as the manufacturer of the year 
during the year  we worked hard to deliver superior products and services to our dealer network 
despite the economic downturn  the development of new products has remained a critical element of our business strategy 
at this year s neocon we introduced new products 
among the most significant achievements at this year s show was a new healthcare product called compass tm  which won a gold award in the healthcare furniture category and the launch of the thrive tm portfolio of ergonomic products  which includes the technology support category s silver award winning flo tm monitor arm 
in launching thrive tm we demonstrated that we can and will move quickly to find new areas to serve our traditional customers and dealers 
we also hosted an invitation only event to preview a new chair family we believe will set a new reference point for comfort  beauty and value 
during the neocon show we announced another milestone for our company being the first in our industry and one of the firs t in the world to fuel of our facilities with renewable energy 
this past year we made significant progress toward our goal of having zero impact on the environment by the year while we still have progress to make  we believe the finish line is in sight 
as in our own business  the severity of the downturn over the past two years has forced our independent dealer network to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies 
as a rule  the financial health of the network remained remarkably strong all year 
during the fourth quarter one exception to this rule prompted action on our part 
we assumed ownership control of an independent dealer  the living edge group  with locations throughout australia  in order to protect the continuity of distribution in that region 
we have moved aggressively to restructure operations and are pursuing a strategy aimed at returning the dealership to profitability and independent ownership 
during our first fiscal quarter of  we completed the acquisition of nemschoff  a healthcare furniture manufacturer in sheboygan  wisconsin 
we immediately began the process of integrating its products and processes into our existing healthcare business 
this acquisition  along with the fiscal acquisition of brandrud  greatly expands our healthcare lineup and our ability to bring complete solutions to the marketplace 
during the fourth quarter we acquired uk based colebrook bosson saunders cbs a leading designer and distributor of ergonomic work accessories 
this acquisition enhances the scale of our existing accessories business and provides a compelling lineup of solutions to our dealers 
the produc ts offered by cbs are now included under the thrive tm portfolio of ergonomic products and services 
as we look forward  with business conditions seemingly improving  there s a growing sense of optimism within the company 
our continued investments in product and business development throughout the downturn have enhanced both the depth and diversity of our market offering  leaving us well equipped to grow in each of our markets 
and it s all backed by the innovative spirit of our people and a brand that we believe is second to none in our industry 
looking forward  the general economic outlook for our industry in the us is expected to improve in fiscal for calendar  bifma expects positive percent and percent growth for orders and sales  respectively 
this projected improvement is based on a forecasted improvement in the us economy  and assumptions that higher employment will prevail in sectors most likely to consume office furniture and that vacancy rates will decline as unemployment rates fall 
financial results the following is a comparison of our annual results of operations and year over year percentage changes for the periods indicated 
dollars in millions fiscal chg from fiscal chg from fiscal net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses operating earnings net other expenses earnings before income taxes income tax expense net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest net earnings attributable to controlling interest the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the components of the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 
fiscal year ended may  may  n bsp  may  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general  and administrative expenses restructuring design and re search expenses total operating expenses operating earnings net other expenses earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings attributable to controlling interest net sales  orders  and backlog fiscal compared to fiscal for the fiscal year ended may   consolidated net sales declined percent to  million from  million for the fiscal year ended may  this year over year decline was driven by the global economic environment and was experienced across nearly all operating and geographic units 
while the us dollar strengthened against many major currencies during fiscal  it weakened against others  notably the canadian dollar 
the overall impact of foreign currency changes for the fiscal year was to increase net sales by approximately million 
consolidated net trade orders for fiscal totaled  million compared to  million in fiscal  a decrease of percent 
order rates began the year at a steady pace with orders averaging between approximately million and million per week through the first two quarters 
these order rates  and other economic inputs  gave a solid signal that the business had hit bottom and was stabilized 
moving into the second half of the year  the third quarter  which historically has the weakest order rate of the year  orders dipped down to an average weekly rate of approximately million per week 
although low  this order rate represented a slight increase in order rates from the prior year 
the fourth quarter order rates averaged approximately million per week  which represented our highest order rate in months 
the overall impact of foreign currency changes for the fiscal year was to increase net orders by approximately million to million 
our backlog of unfilled orders at the end of fiscal totaled million  a percent increase from the million backlog at the end of fiscal bifma reported an estimated year over year decline in us office furniture shipments of approximately percent for the twelve month period ended may by comparison  the net sales decline for our domestic us business was approximately percent 
we believe that while comparisons to bifma are important  we continue to pursue a strategy of revenue diversification that makes us less reliant on the drivers that impact bifma 
net sales  orders  and backlog fiscal compared to fiscal for the fiscal year ended may   consolidated net sales declined percent to  million from  million in fiscal this year over year decline was driven by the global economic environment and was experienced across nearly all operating and geographic units 
the strengthening of the us dollar during fiscal against most major foreign currencies reduced our top line by approximately million 
consolidated net trade orders for fiscal totaled  million 
this is comparable to net trade orders of  million in fiscal  and represents a decrease of percent 
starting with the financial market volatility in early fiscal  in part related to the instability in the banking industry  we ex perienced a sudden and dramatic fall in order rates through most of the third quarter of fiscal order rates stabilized through the fourth quarter of fiscal  albeit at much lower level than fiscal the strong dollar reduced orders by approximately million compared with fiscal our backlog of unfilled orders at the end of fiscal totaled million  a percent decline from million at the end of fiscal bifma reported an estimated year over year decline in us office furniture shipments of approximately percent for the twelve month period ended may by comparison  the net sales decline for our domestic us business was approximately percent 
we believe that while comparisons to bifma are important  we continue to pursue a strategy of revenue diversification that makes us less reliant on the drivers that impact bifma 
discussion of operating segments fiscal compared to fiscal net sales within the north american furniture solutions north america segment were  million in fiscal  a million or percent decrease from fiscal net sales of  million 
we again experienced a decline throughout our north american business operations in fiscal  except for healthcare which benefited from the acquisition of nemschoff in the first quarter 
nemschoff sales were million during fiscal or percent of net sales 
within this segment  we again ex perienced better than average sales from education  government and healthcare customers 
operating earnings for the segment in fiscal were million  or percent of net sales 
this compares to segment earnings of million or percent in fiscal with net sales in the segment down percent  having operating earnings of percent of sales shows the ability to generate strong operating performance despite a significant decline in volume 
this performance is largely due to the variable cost business model  which has allowed costs to be shed as net sales declined 
net sales from the non north ameri can furniture solutions non north america segment were million in fiscal  a million  or percent  decrease from fiscal net sales of million 
there were regions that experienced year over year sales growth  including india  china and brazil 
the areas hardest hit during the year were the middle east and north latin america which were down and percent from prior year  respectively 
operating losses within the non north american segment totaled million for the year or negative percent of net sales 
this compares to operating earnings of million or percent of net sales in fiscal  a decrease of basis points 
the operating loss in fiscal was significant ly affected by an independent dealer in australia that went into receivership and resulted in bad debt expense of approximately million 
net sales within the other segment category were million in fiscal an increase of million  or percent  compared to fiscal net sales of million 
the increase in net sales is the result of strong sales by our north american home business 
it should be noted that while the majority of corporate costs are allocated to the operating segments  certain costs that are generally considered the result of isolated business decisions are not subject to allocation 
restructuring and asset impairment expenses are some of these costs  and have been allocated entirely to the other category in fiscal restructuring and asset impairment expenses totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal and are discussed further in note of the consolidated financial statements 
operating losses within the other segment category totaled million for the year or negative percent of net sales 
this compares to a loss of million or negative percent of net sales in the prior year  an improvement of  basis points 
the significant driver of operating losses in both years were restructuring expenses  though it should be noted that in the current year there were also million of asset impairment charges related to the convia business that contributed to the operating loss 
the us dollar was up and down against the british pound and the euro during fiscal  and weakened throughout the year against the canadian dollar 
t he changes in currency exchange rates from the prior year affected the us dollar value of net sales only in the north american operating segment 
the non north american segment ended the year with essentially no impact from currency on year over year net sales 
we estimate these changes effectively increased our fiscal net sales within the north american furniture solutions segment by approximately million  driven entirely by the us dollar canadian dollar impact  with the mexican peso having a slight negative impact 
it is important to note that period to period changes in currency exchange rates have a directionally similar impact on our international cost structures 
operating earnings within our non north american segment increased an estimated million in fiscal the estimated impact on operating earnings of our north american business segment due to currency changes  was an increase of approximately million 
discussion of operating segments fiscal compared to fiscal net sales within the north american furniture solutions segment decreased from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal this represented a year over year decrease of million or percent 
we experienced a decline throughout our north american business operations  however  there were customer types within this segment that performed better than the overall average  primarily education  government and healthcare customers 
operating earnings for the segment in fiscal were million  or percent of net sales 
this compared to segment earnings of million or percent in fiscal with a net sales decline of percent for the segment  there were both dollar and percent of sales decreases to operating earnings in the north american furniture solutions segment 
this segment s ability to generate strong operating performance despite a significant decline in volume was largely due to our variable business model 
net sales from the non north american furniture solutions segment declined million or percent from fiscal the decline was compounded by the strengthening of the us dollar against most foreign currencies 
n early every region within the segment posted decreases in year over year net sales  however  there were pockets of resiliency including the middle east  south america  and australia 
total net sales for the segment were million  versus million in fiscal the regions which were the hardest hit by the economy were the uk which was down  and japan  down 
operating earnings within the non north american segment totaled million for the year or percent of net sales 
this compares to million or percent of net sales in fiscal  a decrease of basis points 
despite the decline in operating income  our low fixed cost model generated positive income with rapid declines in net sales 
net sales within the other segment category were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was the result of net sales declining within the north american home business  primarily due to the challenges associated with the us economic environment 
this overall decrease was somewhat offset by sales to a new retail customer 
operating losses within our other segment category totaled million for the year or a negative percent of net sales 
this compares to operating income of million or percent of net sales in fiscal  a decrease of  basis points 
restructuring expense allocated to the other segment was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the us dollar strengthened against most major currencies throughout fiscal the changes in currency exchange rates from fiscal affected the us dollar value of net sales within both primary operating segments 
we estimated that these changes effectively decreased our fiscal net sales within the north american furniture solutions segment by approximately million  driven largely by the us dollar  canadian dollar and the mexican peso average exchange rate 
currency exchange rate fluctuations within our non north american furniture solutions segment decreased net sales in fiscal by approximately million 
this was primarily driven by movements in the us dollar british pound sterling 
it is important to note that period to period changes in currency exchange rates have a directionally similar impact on our international cost structures 
operating earnings within the non north american segment increased an estimated million in fiscal due to the aforementioned changes in currency exchange rates relative to the fiscal level 
the estimated impact on operating earnings of our north american business segment was a decrease of approximately million 
gross margin fiscal compared to fiscal our fiscal gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent which is a increase of basis points from the fiscal level 
lower direct material costs due to a reduction in commodity prices along with reduced compen sation and benefits from a reduced work schedule  offset deeper discounting and loss of leverage from lower volume 
details relative to each component of gross margin follow 
direct material costs as a percentage of sales in the current year decreased basis points 
compared to the prior year  raw material prices were lower in the first half of the year and then gradually increased throughout the second half 
the overall impact in the fiscal year was positive 
direct labor costs were higher by basis points as a percentage of sales  though lower in dollars by million  from fiscal levels 
this percentage increase was driven by higher benefit expenses and deeper discounting though it was partially offset by increased operational efficiencies 
overhead costs decreased by million from fiscal  though as a percentage of sales these costs increased basis points 
the percentage increase resulted from lost leverage from lower volume and the impact from deeper discounting in fiscal  though this was partially offset by our ability to realize cost reductions associated with restructuring actions that have taken place over the last months 
freight expenses  as a percentage of sales  were modestly higher by basis points compared to fiscal levels 
in dollars these costs were lower by million 
while fuel costs did rise throughout the year  the largest contributing factor to the increase as a percentage of sales was the loss of volume which created more less than full loads 
gross margin fiscal compared to fiscal our fiscal gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent  a decline of basis points from the fiscal level 
higher direct material costs from vendors coupled with significantly lower volumes contributed to this decreased gross margin performance on a year over year basis 
direct material costs as a percentage of sales in fiscal increased basis points 
the impact was front end loaded as raw material prices increased dramatically in the first half of the fiscal year  stabilized in the third quarter  and then declined substantially by the end of the year ending at approximately the same level they began 
direct labor costs were higher by basis points as a percentage of sales from fiscal levels 
while the costs were slightly higher  this change in performance reflected a quick response to decreasing net sales and an increased efficiency which was somewhat offset by underlying increases in medical benefits 
overhead costs decreased in fiscal by million from fiscal our ability to react quickly to the sales decline  coupled with the variable n ature of our business model  allowed for an improvement of basis points from fiscal the decrease in costs was a result of the restructuring actions that took place during the year and related primarily to headcount 
freight expenses  as a percentage of sales  were modestly lower compared to levels 
contributing to the reduction in freight expenses was a significant decrease in diesel fuel prices in the united states  as we moved through the year 
restructuring fiscal throughout fiscal  we continued to take actio ns to decrease our cost structure 
in the first quarter we announced a plan to consolidate manufacturing operations by closing the brandrud manufacturing facility in auburn  washington and consolidating it with the acquired nemschoff manufacturing facilities 
we had previously announced the decision to consolidate our integrated metal technologies imt subsidiary in spring lake  michigan with other existing manufacturing facilities 
our operations team worked diligently throughout the year to complete both consolidation projects in the fourth quarter 
the total expense of these plant consolidations in the fiscal year totaled approximately million 
we expect to realize incremental annual savings from these consolidation actions of approximately million to million from the current year expense level 
these savings will be realized primarily in cost of sales  from reductions in rent expense  depreciation and utilities  as well as savings of approximately million in selling  general  and administ rative expenses 
we realized approximately million of savings in the current year 
in the fourth quarter we took further action to reduce our salaried workforce  primarily in north america  with the reduction of approximately employees 
this action resulted in expenses of approximately million and will largely be offset by a percent wage increase for employees impacted by the current year wage reduction action 
included in the fourth quarter restructuring expenses is an impairment of long lived assets totaling million that were related to our convia line of business 
these assets related to products that we determined had no future revenue stream to the company 
the restructuring accrual balance of million is included in  accrued liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on restructuring 
restructuring fiscal in fiscal  we announced a restructuring program designed to align our cost structure with the economic conditions 
these actions resulted in the elimination of approximately  permanent and temporary positions across our operations 
these reductions were permanent for our salaried workforce  while our direct labor positions were reduced until business levels return 
those positions that were permanently eliminated represented a variety of functional areas  and the individuals affected were offered one time termination benefits  including severance and outplacement services 
in addition to the reduction in the workforce we announced plans to shut down our imt facility in spring lake  michigan 
only the expenses related to the curtailment and special termination benefits of the pension plan were recognized in fiscal pre tax restructuring expenses for the aforementioned actions totaled million in fiscal  which are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
the related cash payments were million in fiscal and the balance of the restructuring accrual at may  was million  which was reflected in the consolidated balance sheet within accrued liabilities 
operating expense fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses in fiscal were million  or percent of net sales  which compares to million  or percent of net sales in fiscal we experienced a year over year decrease in operating expense dollars of million  and a basis point increase to operating expenses as a percentage of sales 
restructuring and impairment expenses  which included an impairment charge for convia assets of million  were million in fiscal  which was a decrease of million from the million of restructuring expense in fiscal please see the discussion on restructuring expense above for additional detail 
the operating expenses from nemschoff during fiscal year were million  which were partially offset by the positive impact on operating expense resulting from reducing the estimated liability related to contingent payments associated with the nemschoff acquisition of million 
the year over year dollar decline in total expenses of million was the result of an million decrease in restructuring and impairment expenses and a continued decrease in employee compensation and benefit costs 
these decreases in compensation and benefit costs are a result of a combination of current and prior year restructuring as well as the full year effect of the suspension of the k match and the percent reduction in salary expense that resulted from shutting down facilities on every other friday 
year over year changes in currency exchange rates had a slightly inflationary effect of approximately million on operating expenses associated with our international operations 
design and research costs included in total operating expenses for fiscal was million  or percent of sales  compared to fiscal expenses of million  or percent of sales 
this decrease in dollars of million was an increase of basis points as a percent of sales and was primarily driven by the timing of various projects being brought to market as well as a continuing evaluation of projects and priorities 
we have continued to carefully balance the overall need to control costs with the critical need to continue i nvesting in our strategic priorities 
these expenses include royalty payments to the designers of our products totaling million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
operating expense fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses in fiscal were million  or percent of net sales  which compares to million  or percent of net sales in fiscal although there was a year over year decrease of million  we experienced a basis point increase to operating expenses as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal a charge of million for restructuring expenses as discussed above is included in fiscal there was a restructuring charge of million in fiscal the year over year dollar decline in expenses  excluding restructuring expense  was million or 
this is primarily due to a decrease in employee compensation and benefit costs as a result of the restructuring actions previously described  as well as a reduction in incentive compensation 
year over year changes in currency exchange rates had a deflationary impact on operating expenses associated with our international operations  as measured in us dollars 
we estimate these changes decreased our consolidated operating expenses in fiscal by approximately million relative to fiscal design and research expenses included in total operating expenses were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these expenses include royalty payments to the designers of our products 
we consider such royalty payments  which totaled million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  to be variable costs of the products being sold 
see further discussion on d esign and research expenses in note of the consolidated financial statements 
operating earnings in fiscal operating earnings were million  a percent decrease from fiscal operating earnings of million 
the fiscal earnings represented a percent decrease from fiscal operating earnings o f million 
operating earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal years  and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the decrease in operating earnings in fiscal in both dollars and as a percent of sales is almost entirely due to the million  or percent  decrease in net sales 
operating earnings in fiscal decreased to percent of net sales  a basis point decrease from the percent reported in the prior year 
the increase in restructuring expense led to basis points of the decline while the remainder was largely a result of the decline in volume 
other expenses and income net other expenses totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal expense compared to fiscal was primarily the result of decreased interest expense associated with the first quarter repurchase of million of outstanding debt securities 
the increase in expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was principally driven by additional interest expense of million in fiscal associated with additional senior subordinated notes 
additionally  net foreign currency tr ansaction losses recorded in fiscal totaled million versus a million gain in fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate was percent in fiscal versus percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal the effective rate in fiscal was below the statutory rate of percent  primarily due to the release of tax reserves that were no longer needed due to the closure of an irs audit of the company s tax returns through fiscal and the domestic us manufacturing tax incentive 
the effective rate in fiscal was below the statutory rate of percent  primarily due to the domestic us manufacturing tax incent ive and the realization of foreign tax credits 
the effective rate in fiscal was below the statutory rate primarily due to the domestic us manufacturing tax incentive 
we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal to be between and percent 
for further information regarding income taxes  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
net earnings attributable to controlling interest  earnings per share in fiscal we generated million of net earnings attributable to controlling interest 
this compares to net earnings attributable to controlling interest in fiscal and fiscal of million and million  respectively 
in fiscal diluted earnings per share were while diluted earnings per share in fiscal were and in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the table below presents certain key cash flow and capital highlights for the fiscal years indicated 
fiscal year ended in millions cash and cash equivalents  end of period short term investments  end of period cash generated from operating activities cash used for investing activities ca sh used for financing activities pension and post retirement benefit plan contributions capital expenditures stock repurchased and retired interest bearing debt  end of period available unsecured credit facility  end of period amounts shown include the fair market value of the company s interest rate swap arrangement s 
the net fair value of this these arrangement s was were million at may   million at may   and million at may  amounts shown are net of outstanding letters of credit  which are applied against the company s unsecured credit facility  and excludes the million accordion feature disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
during the first quarter of fiscal we renegotiated the unsecured revolving credit facility 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company issued new senior unsecured private placement notes and replaced its unsecured revolving credit facility 
refer to notes and of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
amount shown for fiscal includes a million contribution made in the company s common stock 
cash flow operating activities cash generated from operating activities in fiscal totaled million compared to million generated in the prior year 
this represents an increase of million compared to fiscal changes in working capital balances resulted in a million source of cash in the current fiscal year compared to a million use of cash in the prior year 
cash from operations also included proceeds of million from company owned life insurance policies in fiscal the source of cash related to working capital balances in fiscal is primarily driven from a decrease in trade receivables of million  a decrease in prepaids of million and an increase in trade payables of million 
these favorable changes were offset by an increased investment in inventory of million and a decrease in other accruals 
the other accruals decreased primarily due to restructuring payments of million during fiscal the use of cash related to working capital balances in fiscal is primarily driven from decreased current liabilities of million over fiscal the reduction in liabilities is primarily related to reductions in accounts payable related to inventory  and accruals related to regular and incentive compensation 
the use of cash is partially offset by volume related declines in accounts receivables of million and inventories of million 
accounts receivable declined from fiscal  though it should be noted  this decline is not as substantial as the quarterly decline in sales 
however  this lag is not reflective of deterioration of the accounts receivable aging  but rather the timing of the sales within the fourth quarter and the customer type 
certain direct customers and geographic customers tend to have a longer pay cycle 
a relatively large percentage of the north american accounts receivable increase pertains to our mexican subsidiary w hich has the longest cash collection cycle in the north american segment 
the source of cash related to working capital balances in fiscal is primarily driven from increased current liabilities of million over fiscal  and to a lesser extent  lower inventory of million from prior year levels 
the increase in current liabilities is comprised of million in tax related accruals  million of increased trade accounts payable and million of other accruals 
these sources of cash are offset partially by increases in volume related accounts receivable of million due to increased sales inside and outside north america 
collections of accounts receivable remained strong throughout the year  and we believe our recorded accounts receivable valuation allowances at the end of fiscal are adequate to cover the risk of potential bad debts 
allowances for non collectible accounts receivable  as a percent of gross accounts receivable  totaled percent  percent  and percent at the end of fiscal years   and  respectively 
during fiscal million in cash contributions were made to our employee pension and post retirement benefit plans 
cash contributions during fiscal years and made to our employee pension and post retirement be nefit plans totaled million and million  respectively 
for further information regarding the company s pension and post retirement benefit plans  including information relative to the funded status of these plans  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
cash flow investing activities capital expenditures totaled million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
outstanding commitments for future capital purchases at the end of fiscal were approximately million 
we expect capital spending in fiscal to be between million and million 
included in the fiscal investing activities  is a net cash outflow of million related to our acquisitions of nemschoff  cbs  and two furniture dealerships during fiscal also included within fiscal investing activities is a note receivable for million related to our acquisition of nemschoff 
included in our fiscal investing activities  is a net cash outflow of million related to the completion of our acquisition of brandrud  and million related to our acquisition of certain elements of ruskin industries 
in fiscal  our investing activities included a net cash outflow of million related to the acquisition of brandrud 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further information related to these acquisitions 
our net marketable securities transactions for fiscal yielded a million source of cash 
this compares to a million source of cash in fiscal in fiscal we repaid loans held against the value of company owned life insurance policies for million 
in fisc al  we were advanced million of cash against the value of company owned life insurance policies 
these activities are reflected as cash payments and proceeds  respectively within the investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
cash flow financing activities fiscal year ended in millions  except share and per share data shares acquired cost of shares acquired shares issued average price per share issued cash dividends paid on january   the company entere d into two agreements to purchase shares of its common stock from morgan stanley co 
inc for an aggregate purchase price of million  plus fees  under an accelerated share repurchase asr program 
the total number of shares repurchased under the asr was  at an average price of per share 
includes  shares issued in connection with the nemschoff acquisition and  shares issued as a contribution to the company s pension plans 
during the first quarter of fiscal we renegotiated the syndicated revolving line of credit  reducing our a vailability from million to million  while giving us additional covenant flexibility 
this facility expires in june and outstanding borrowings bear interest at rates based on the prime rate  federal funds rate  libor  or negotiated rates as outlined in the agreement 
interest is payable periodically throughout the period a borrowing is outstanding 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we also completed the repurchase of million of the registered debt securities 
in addition to improving our covenant metrics this action also reduces our future interest expense by approximately million per quarter 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we announced a reduction in the cash dividend effective for the first quarter of fiscal payment 
this chan ge reduced the cash dividend to per share versus a total quarterly cash dividend of per share that was paid through the third quarter of fiscal in fiscal we completed a debt financing transaction involving the issuance of million in senior unsecured private placement notes 
notes totaling million are due in january  and bear interest at a fixed annual coupon rate of percent 
the remaining million of these notes are due in january and bear interest at a fixed annual coupon rate of percent 
we used the million proceeds from the notes for an asr of our common stock 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our long term debt 
in fiscal  we also paid off million of debt on behalf of brandrud  our most recent acquisition 
as part of our decision to conserve cash we suspended significant share repurchases beginning in fiscal in fiscal we repurchased shares totaling million 
the amount remaining under our share repurchase authorization at the end of fiscal totaled million 
interest bearing debt at the end of fiscal of million decreased from million at the end of fiscal  as compared to million at the end of fiscal the decrease in fiscal is a result of o ur early retirement of million of our senior notes 
the only usage against our unsecured revolving credit facility at the end of fiscal years and represented outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million and million  respectively 
the provisions of our private placement notes and unsecured credit facility require that we adhere to certain covenant restrictions and maintain certain performance ratios 
we were in compliance with all such restrictions and performance ratios during fiscal i n fiscal  we received million related to the issuance of shares in connection with stock based benefit plans 
this compares to receiving million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal we did not repatriate any undistributed foreign earnings as compared to million in fiscal we believe cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and our borrowing capacity will provide adequate liquidity to fund near term and future business operations and capital needs  subject to financing availability in the marketplace 
co ntingencies the company leases a facility in the uk under an agreement that expires in june under the terms of the lease  the company is required to perform the maintenance and repairs necessary to address the general dilapidation of the facility over the lease term 
the ultimate cost of this provision to the company is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the future use of the facility by the lessor and whether the company chooses and is permitted to renew the lease term 
the company has estimated the cost of these maintenance and repairs to be between and million  depending on the outcome of future plans and negotiations 
based on existing circumstances  it is estimated that these costs will most likely approximate million 
as a result  this amount has been recorded as a liabilit y reflected under the caption other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of may  based on circumstances existing in fiscal  the amount recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of may  was million 
the company has a lease obligation in the uk until may for a facility that it has exited 
current market rates for comparable office space are lower than the rental payments owed under the lease agreement  as such  the company would remain liable to pay the difference if it were subleased 
as of may  and may  the future cost of this arrangement was estimated to be million and million  respectively 
accordingly this amount is reflected within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of these dates 
the company is involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
it is the company s opinion that the outcome of such proceedings and litigation currently pending will not materially affect the company s operations  cash flows  and financial condition

contractual obligations contractual obligations associated with our ongoing business and financing activities will result in cash payments in future periods 
the following table summarizes the amounts and estimated timing of these future cash payments

estimated future interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations are based on interest rates as of may  actual cash outflows may differ significantly due to changes in underlying interest rates and timing of principal payments 
purchase obligations consist of non cancelable purchase orders and commitments for goods  services  and capital assets 
pension plan funding commitments are known for a month period for those plans that are funded  unfunded pension and post retirement plan funding amounts are equal to the estima ted benefit payments 
as of may   the total accumulated benefit obligation for our domestic and international employee pension benefit plans was million 
represents the recorded dividend payable as of may  future dividend payments are not consider ed contractual obligations until declared 
other contractual obligations primarily represent long term commitments related to deferred and supplemental employee compensation benefits  and other post employment benefits 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees we provide certain guarantees to third parties under various arrangements in the form of product warranties  loan guarantees  standby letters of credit  lease guarantees  performance bonds  and indemnification provisions 
these arrangements are accounted for and disclosed in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic  guarantees as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
variable interest entities on occasion  we provide financial support to certain independent dealers in the form of term loans  lines of credit  and loan guarantees 
at may  and may   we were not considered the primary beneficiary of any such dealer relationships as defined by asc topic  consolidation therefore  no entities were included as vies as of these dates 
the risks and rewards associated with our interests in these dealerships are primarily limited to our outstanding loans and guarantee amounts 
as of may  and may   our maximum exposure to potential losses related to outstanding loans to these dealerships totaled million and million  respectively 
information on our exposure related to any outstanding loan guarantees provided to such entities is included in note of the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our goal is to report financial results clearly and understandably 
we follow us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements  which require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
we continually review our accounting policies and financial information disclosures 
these policies and disclosures are reviewed at least annually with the audit committee of the board of directors 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements 
revenue recognition as described in the ldq uo  executive overview  the majority of our products and services are sold through one of four channels independent contract furniture dealers and licensees  owned contract furniture dealers  direct to end customers  and independent retailers 
we recognize revenue on sales to independent dealers  licensees  and retailers once the product is shipped and title passes to the buyer 
when we sell product directly to the end customer or to owned dealers  we recognize revenue once the product and services are delivered and installation thereof is substantially complete 
amounts recorded as net sales generally include any freight charged to customers  with the related freight expenses recognized within cost of sales 
items such as discounts off list price  rebates  and other sale related marketing program expenses are recorded as reductions to net sales 
we record accruals for rebates and other marketing programs  which require us to make estimates about future customer buying patterns and market conditions 
customer sales that reach or fail to reach certain levels can affect the amount of such estimates  and actual results could differ from our estimates receivable allowances we base our allowances for receivables on known customer exposures  historical credit experience  and the specific identification of other potential problems  including the current economic climate 
these methods are applied to all major receivables  including trade  lease  and notes receivable 
in addition  we follow a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the age of outstanding accounts receivable 
actual collections can differ from our historical experience  and if economic or business conditions deteriorate significantly  adjustments to these reserves may be required 
the accounts receivable allowance totaled million and million at may  and may   respectively 
as a percentage of gross accounts receivable  these allowances totaled percent and percent  respectively 
the year over year decrease in the allowance percentage is primarily due to the stabilization of economic conditions and continued financial health of our customers 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of may  and may   were million and million  respectively 
the increase in these balances is primarily the result of the first quarter acquisition of nemschoff and the fourth quarter acquisition of cbs 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further detail on acquisitions 
we account for our goodwill and indefinite lived assets in accordance w ith the asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
under this accounting guidance  we are required to perform an annual test on our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to determine if the asset values are impaired 
our impairment testing model is based partly on the present value of projected cash flows and the resulting residual value as well as a market based approach that considers recent market capitalization values of companies who participate in the contract office furniture industry 
in completing the test under this approach  we assume that one of the drivers of the value of a business today is the cash flows it will generate in the future 
we also assume that such future cash flows can be reasonably estimated 
while these projected cash flows reflect our best estimate of future reporting unit performance  actual cash flows could differ significantly 
we completed the required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of fiscal and concluded that our net goodwill asset values and indefinite lived assets were not impaired 
for goodwill  we employed a market based approach in selecting the discount rates used in our analysis 
by this  we mean the discount rates selected represent market rates of return equal to what we believe a reasonable investor would expect to achieve on investments of similar size to our reporting units 
we believe the discount rates selected in our testing are conservative in that  in all cases  they exceed the estimated weighted average cost of capital for our business as a whole 
the results of the impairment test are sensitive to changes in discount rates  though the testing performed in fiscal indicates that even a significant increase in the discount rate would not have changed our conclusion 
for indefinite lived assets a relief of royalty method was utilized  which indicated the assets were not impaired 
long lived assets we evaluate other long lived assets and acquired business units for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment risk may be present 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on market conditions  operational performance  and estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the asset to its estimated fair value 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company recorded an impairment charge of million that was related to our convia line of business 
these assets related to products that we determined had no future revenue stream to the company 
the impairment charge was comprised of million of expense related to an intangible asset and million of expense in relation to fixed assets  respectively 
warranty reserve we stand behind our products and keep our promises to customers 
from time to time  quality issues arise resulting in the need to incur costs to correct problems with products or services 
we have established warranty reserves for the various costs associated with these guarantees 
general warranty reserves are based on historical claims experience and periodically adjusted for business levels 
specific reserves are established once an issue is identified 
the valuation of such reserves is based on the estimated costs to correct the problem 
actual costs may vary and may result in an adjustment to these reserves 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories at the majority of our manufacturing operations are valued using the last in  first out lifo method  whereas inventories of certain other subsidiaries are valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
we establish reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  based on prevailing circumstances and judgment for consideration of current events  such as economic conditions  that may affect inventory 
the reserve required to record inventory at lower of cost or market may be adjusted in response to changing conditions 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the company adopted the uncertain tax position provisions within asc topic  income taxes  during the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the adoption  the company recorded an increase in liabilities for income tax accruals associated with tax benefits claimed on tax returns but not recognized for financial statements purposes unrecognized tax benefits 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s uncertain tax positions 
we have net operating loss nol carryforwards available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income 
we also have foreign tax credits available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future tax due 
future ta x benefits for nol carryforwards and foreign tax credits are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we base this determination on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax planning strategies available to us will enable us to utilize the nol carryforwards and or foreign tax credits 
when information becomes available that raises doubts about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
self insurance reserves with the assistance of indep endent actuaries  we establish reserves for workers compensation and general liability exposures 
the reserves are established based on expected future claims for incurred losses 
we also establish reserves for health  prescription drugs  and dental benefit exposures based on historical claims information along with certain assumptions about future trends 
the methods and assumptions used to determine the liabilities are applied consistently  although actual claims experience can vary 
we also maintain insurance coverage for certain risk exposures through traditional premium based insurance policies 
pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits depends on certain actuarial assumptions 
among the most significant of these assu mptions is the discount rate  interest crediting rate  and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we determine these assumptions as follows 
discount rate this assumption is established at the end of the fiscal year based on high quality corporate bond yields 
we uti lize the services of an independent actuarial firm to analyze and recommend an appropriate rate 
for our domestic pension and other post retirement benefit plans  the actuary uses a cash flow matching technique  which compares the estimated future cash flows of the plan to a published discount curve showing the relationship between interest rates and duration for hypothetical zero coupon fixed income investments 
we set the discount rate for our international pension plan based on the yield level of a commonly used corporate bond index in that jurisdiction 
because the average duration of the bonds underlying this index is less than that of our international pension plan liabilities  the index yield is used as a reference point 
the final discount rate  which takes into consideration the index yield and the difference in comparative durations  is based on a recommendation from our independent actuarial consultant 
interest crediting rate we use this assumption in accounting for our primary domestic pension plan  which is a cash balance type plan 
the rate  which represents the annual rate of interest applied to each plan participant s account balance  is established at an assumed level  or spread  below the discount rate 
we base this methodology on the historical spread between the year us treasury and high quality corporate bond yields 
this relationship is examined annually to determine whether the methodology is still appropriate 
expected long term rate of return we base this assumption on our long term assumed rates of return for equities and fixed income securities  weighted by the allocation of the invested assets of the pension plan 
we consider risk factors specific to the various classes of investments and advice from independent actuaries in establishing this rate 
changes in the investment allocation of plan assets would impact this assumption 
a shift to a higher relative percentage of fixed income securities  for example  would result in a lower assumed rate 
while this assumption represents our long term market retu rn expectation  actual asset returns can and do differ from year to year 
such differences give rise to actuarial gains and losses 
in years where actual market returns are lower than the assumed rate  an actuarial loss is generated 
conversely  an actuarial gain results when actual market returns exceed the assumed rate in a given year 
as of may   and may   the net actuarial loss associated with our employee pension and post retirement benefit plans totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the majority of this unrecognized l oss was associated with lower than expected discount rates for fiscal and lower than expected plan asset returns in fiscal changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the expense or obligations related to our pension plans 
we cannot accurately predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and  therefore  cannot reasonably estimate whether adjustments to our expense or obligation in subsequent years will be significant 
both the may  pension funded status and expense are affected by year end discount rate and expected return on assets assumptions 
any change to these assumptions will be specific to the time periods noted and may not be additive  so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown 
the effect of the indicated increase decrease in discount rates and expected return on assets is shown below in millions assumption percent change expense may  obligation us international us international discount rate expected return on assets for purposes of determining annual net pension expense  we use a calculated method for determining the market related value of plan assets 
under this method  we recognize the cha nge in fair value of plan assets systematically over a five year period 
accordingly  a portion of our net actuarial loss is deferred 
the remaining portion of the net actuarial loss is subject to amortization expense each year 
the amortization period used in determining this expense is the estimated remaining working life of active pension plan participants 
we currently estimate this period to be approximately years 
as of may   the deferred net actuarial loss ie the portion of the total net actuarial loss not subject to amortization was approximately million 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions used for employee benefit plans 
stock based compensation we view stock based compensation as a key component of total compensation for certain of our employees  non emp loyee directors and officers 
we account for these programs  which include grants of restricted stock  restricted stock units  performance share units  employee stock purchases  and stock options  in accordance with asc topic under this guidance we recognize compensation expense related to each of these share based arrangements 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model in estimating the fair value of stock options issued in connection with our compensation program 
this pricing model requires the use of several input assumptions 
among the most significant of these assumptions are the expected volatility of our common stock price  and the expected timing of future stock option exercises 
expected volatility this represents a measure  expressed as a percentage  of the expected fluctuation in the market price of our common stock 
as a point of reference  a high volatility percentage would assume a wider expected range of market returns for a particular security 
all other assumptions held constant  this would yield a higher stock option valuation than a calculation using a lower measure of volatility 
in measuring the fair value of stock options issued during fiscal year  we utilized an expected volatility of percent 
expected term of options this assumption represents the expected length of time between the grant date of a stock option and the date at which it is exercised option life 
we assumed an average expected term of years in calculating the fair values of the majority of stock options issued during fiscal refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our stock based compensation plans 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we encounter matters that raise the potential for contingent liabilities 
in evaluating these matters for accounting treatment and disclosure  we are re quired to apply judgment in order to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred 
we are also required to measure  if possible  the dollar value of such liabilities in determining whether or not recognition in our financial statements is required 
this process involves the use of estimates which may differ from actual outcomes 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to contingencies 
new accounting standards refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for information related to new accounting standards 
forward looking statements certain statements in this filing are not historical facts but are forward looking statements as defined under section a of the securities act of  as amended  and sectio n e of the securities exchange act  as amended 
such statements are based on management s belief  assumptions  current expectations  estimates and projections about the office furniture industry  the economy and the company itself 
words like anticipates  believes  confident  estimates  expects  forecast  likely  plans  projects  and should  and variations of such words and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these statements do not guarantee future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict with regard to timing  expense  likelihood  and degree of occurrence 
these risks include  without limitation  employment and general economic conditions in the us and in our international markets  the increase in white collar employment  the willingness of customers to undertake capital expenditures  t he types of products purchased by customers  the possibility of order cancellations or deferrals by customers  competitive pricing pressures  the availability and pricing of direct materials  our reliance on a limited number of suppliers  currency fluctuations  the ability to increase prices to absorb the additional costs of direct materials  the financial strength of our dealers  the financial strength of our customers  the mix of our products purchased by customers  our ability to attract and retain key executives and other qualified employees  our ability to continue to make product innovations  the strength of the intellectual property relating to our products  the success of newly introduced products  our ability to serve all of our markets  possible acquisitions  divestitures or alliances  the outcome of pending litigation or governmental audits or investigations  and other risks identified in this form k and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
therefore  actual results an d outcomes may materially differ from what we express or forecast

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manufactures  markets  and sells its products throughout the world and  as a result  is subject to changing economic conditions  which could reduce the demand for its products 
direct material costs the company is exposed to risks arising from price changes for certain direct materials and assembly components used in its operations 
the largest such costs incurred by the company are for steel  plastics  textiles  wood particleboard  and aluminum components 
commodity prices decreased during the first three quarters and moderately increased during the fourth quarter of fiscal the net impact of price changes during fiscal was an decrease to our costs of million to million over fiscal commodity prices were volatile during fiscal  resulting in sharp increases in costs for the first half of the year 
as the year progressed  prices receded back to approximately the same level that they began the year at 
the net impact of price changes during fiscal was an increase to our costs of million to million 
commodity prices were fairly flat during most of fiscal  resulting in increased costs of million to million  with most of this increase occurring in the fourth quarter 
steel and fuel price fluctuations have a direct impact on our input costs for many products 
throughout fiscal both factors rose moderately during the year 
during fiscal both factors increased sharply  followed by a steady decline in the second half of the year 
during fiscal the impact of steel price increases was fairly flat due to price contracts with suppliers 
the company believes market prices for comm odities in the near term may move higher and acknowledges that over time increases on its key direct materials and assembly components are likely 
consequently  it views the prospect of such increases as an outlook risk to the business 
foreign exchange risk the company primarily manufactures its products in the united states  united kingdom  and china 
it also sources completed products and product components from outside the united states 
the company s completed products are sold in numerous countries around the world 
sales in foreign countries as well as certain expenses related to those sales are transacted in currencies other than the company s reporting currency  the us dollar 
accordingly  production costs and profit margins related to these sales are affected by the currency exchange relationship between the countries where the sales take place and the countries where the products are sourced or manufactured 
these currency exchange relationships can also affect the company s competitive positions within these markets 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
the principal foreign currencies in which the company conducts its business are the british pound sterling  euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  mexican peso  and chinese renminbi 
as of may   the company had outstanding  nine forward currency instruments designed to offset either net asset or net liability exposure denominated in non functional currencies 
one forward contract was placed in order to offset million euro denominated net asset exposure and three forward contracts were placed in order to offset million us dollar denominated net asset exposure 
four forward contracts were placed to offset a million us dollar denominated net liability exposure and one forward contract was placed to offset a million british pound sterling denominated net liability exposure 
as of may   the company had outstanding  nine forward currency instruments designed to offset either net asset or net liability exposure that is denominated in non functional currencies 
three forward contracts were placed in order to offset million euro denominated net asset exposure and three forward contracts were placed in order to offset million us dollar denominated net asset exposure 
two forward contracts were placed to offset a million us dollar denominated net liability exposure 
one forward contract was placed to offset a million british pound sterling denominated net liability exposure 
at the end of fiscal  three contracts were placed to offset million euro for net asset exposure and two contracts for million us dollars were placed to offset net liability exposure 
in all three years  the instruments were marked to market at the end of the period  with changes in fair value reflected in net earnings 
the fair value of the forward currency instruments was negligible for fiscal the fair value of the forward currency instruments was million for both fiscal years and  respectively 
for fiscal year  a net gain of million related to remeasuring all foreign currency transactions into the appropriate functional currency was included in net earnings 
for fiscal year  a net loss of million impacted net earnings 
for fiscal year  a net gain of million impacted net earnings 
additionally  the cumulative effect of translating the balance sheet and income statement accounts from the functional currency into the united states dollar increased the accumulated comprehensive loss component of total shareholders equity by million and million as of the end of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
conversely  the effect reduced the accumulated comprehensive loss component of total shareholders equity by million for fiscal interest rate risk the company maintains fixed rate debt for which changes in interest rates generally affect fair market value but not earnings or cash flows 
as of the end of fiscal years   and the company held one interest rate swap agreement that effectively converts million of fixed rate debt securities to a variable rate 
this debt is subject to changes in interest rates  which  if significant  could have a material impact on the company s financial results 
the interest rate swap derivative instruments are held and used by the company as a tool for managing interest rate risk 
they are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the counterparties to these swap instruments are large financial insti tutions that the company believes are of high quality creditworthiness 
while the company may be exposed to potential losses due to the credit risk of non performance by these counterparties  such losses are not anticipated 
the combined fair market value and net asset amount of the effective interest rate swap instruments was million  million  and million at may   may   and may   respectively 
the impact of these swap instruments on total interest expense was a reduction to interest expense of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal all cash flows related to the company s interest rate swap instruments are denominated in us dollars 
for further information  refer to notes a nd of the consolidated financial statements 
as of may   the weighted average interest rate on the company s variable rate debt was approximately percent 
based on the level of variable rate debt outstanding as of that date  a one percentage point increase in the weighted average interest rate would increase the company s annual pre tax interest expense by approximately million 
expected cash flows notional amounts over the next five years and thereafter related to debt instruments are as follows
