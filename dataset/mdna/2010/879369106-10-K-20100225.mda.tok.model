item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure that  in the event of a significant deterioration of our operating results  we will be able to satisfy those ratios 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our senior debt facilities 
if we fail to maintain compliance with these covenants and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders under the senior debt facilities  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior debt facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the facilities 
if the lenders under the senior debt facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings and we are not able to obtain financing to enable repayment  we likely would have to liquidate significant assets  which nevertheless may not be sufficient to repay our borrowings 
we are subject to risks associated with our non us operations 
although no material concentration of our manufacturing operations exists in any single country  we have significant manufacturing operations outside the united states  including operations conducted through entities that are not wholly owned 
as of  and for the year ended  december   approximately of our total fixed assets and of our total net revenues were attributable to products directly distributed from our operations outside the us our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us  including exchange controls  currency restrictions and fluctuations in currency values  trade protection measures  import or export requirements  subsidies or increased access to capital for firms who are currently or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we have operations  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  restrictions and taxes related to the repatriation of foreign earnings  differing labor regulations  differing protection of intellectual property  unsettled political and economic conditions and possible terrorist attacks against american interests 
these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business  results of operations and financial condition generally 
foreign currency exchange rate  commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 
we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
we expect revenue from products manufactured in  and sold into  non us markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue 
our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in non us currencies to non us dollars  our reporting currency 
when the us dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries where we sell or manufacture our products  such as the euro  our us dollar reported revenue and income will fluctuate 
although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows denominated in non functional currency in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations  changes in the relative values of currencies may  in some instances  have a significant effect on our results of operations 
many of our products have significant steel and plastic resin content 
we also use quantities of other commodities  including copper and zinc 
although we monitor our exposure to these commodity price increases as an integral part of our overall risk management program  volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services 
we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect our results 
as a company with significant operations outside of the us  we are subject to taxation in numerous countries  states and other jurisdictions 
as a result  our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries  states and other jurisdictions in which we operate 
in preparing our financial statements  we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of the countries  states and other jurisdictions in which we operate 
our effective tax rate  however  may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors  including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country  changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws 
any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations  which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  unfavorable results of tax audits and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate  among other things  could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
an interruption in our manufacturing operations may adversely affect our business 
many of our key products across all three of our business segments are manufactured at single locations  with limited alternate facilities 
if an event occurs that results in damage to one or more of our facilities  it may not be possible to timely manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or at all 
in addition  with respect to our medical segment  due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products  we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials 
a reduction or interruption in manufacturing  or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components that are acceptable to us  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
further adverse developments in general domestic and global economic conditions combined with a continuation of volatile global credit markets could adversely impact our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions  including recession or economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets 
the credit and capital markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption over the past year  leading to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending 
these recessionary conditions have caused customers to reduce  modify  delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services 
while recent indicators suggest modest improvement in the united states and global economy  we cannot predict the timing or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more normalized spending behaviors 
if the recessionary conditions continue or worsen  our customers may terminate existing purchase orders or reduce the volume of products or services they purchase from us in the future 
adverse economic and financial market conditions may also cause our suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments to us or may cause suppliers to make changes in the credit terms they extend to us  such as shortening the required payment period for outstanding accounts receivable or reducing the maximum amount of trade credit available to us 
these types of actions by our suppliers could significantly affect our liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and financial market conditions  we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes  and our business could be negatively affected 
in addition  the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet have increased significantly in recent years  primarily as a result of the acquisition of arrow international in adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
our technology is important to our success  and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 
because many of our products rely on proprietary technology  we believe that the development and protection of our intellectual property rights is important  though not essential  to the future success of our business 
in addition to relying on our patents  trademarks and copyrights  we rely on confidentiality agreements with employees and other measures to protect our know how and trade secrets 
despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights  unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology 
the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of this technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us moreover  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the know how and trade secrets or develop better technology than ours or that current and former employees  contractors and other parties will not breach confidentiality agreements  misappropriate proprietary information and copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights 
our inability to protect our proprietary technology could result in competitive harm that could adversely affect our business 
we depend upon relationships with physicians and other health care professionals 
the research and development of some of our products is dependent on our maintaining strong working relationships with physicians and other health care professionals 
we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding our products and the development of our products 
physicians assist us as researchers  product consultants  inventors and as public speakers 
if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and receive the benefits of their knowledge  advice and input  our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of services 
approximately of our net revenues are generated by operations for which a significant part of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements in foreign jurisdictions 
it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future 
strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business

item legal proceedings on october   the company s subsidiary  arrow international  inc arrow  received a corporate warning letter from the us food and drug administration fda 
the letter cited three site specific warning letters issued by the fda in and subsequent inspections performed from june to february at arrow s facilities in the united states 
the letter expressed concerns with arrow s quality systems  including complaint handling  corrective and preventive action  process and design validation  inspection and training procedures 
it also advised that arrow s corporate wide program to evaluate  correct and prevent quality system issues has been deficient 
limitations on pre market approvals and certificates for foreign governments had previously been imposed on arrow based on prior inspections and the corporate warning letter did not impose additional sanctions that are expected to have a material financial impact on the company 
in connection with its acquisition of arrow  completed on october   the company developed an integration plan that included the commitment of significant resources to correct these previously identified regulatory issues and further improve overall quality systems 
senior management officials from the company have met with fda representatives  and a comprehensive written corrective action plan was presented to fda in late at the end of  the fda began its reinspections of the arrow facilities covered by the corporate warning letter 
these inspections have been substantially completed  and the fda has issued certain written observations to arrow as a result of those inspections 
we are currently in the process of responding to those observations and communicating with the fda regarding resolution of all outstanding issues 
while the company continues to believe it has substantially remediated these issues through the corrective actions taken to date  there can be no assurances that these issues have been resolved to the satisfaction of the fda 
if the company s remedial actions are not satisfactory to the fda  the company may have to devote additional financial and human resources to its efforts  and the fda may take further regulatory actions against the company 
in addition  we are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business 
these lawsuits and claims include actions involving product liability  intellectual property  employment and environmental matters 
based on information currently available  advice of counsel  established reserves and other resources  we do not believe that any such actions are likely to be  individually or in the aggregate  material to our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
however  in the event of unexpected further developments  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters  or other similar matters  if unfavorable  may be materially adverse to our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity

free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure 
we use this financial measure for internal managerial purposes  when publicly providing guidance on possible future results  and to evaluate period to period comparisons 
this financial measure is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures 
management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors because it facilitates an assessment of funds available to satisfy current and future obligations  pay dividends and fund acquisitions 
free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the company has certain non discretionary obligations  such as debt service  that are not deducted from the measure 
management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure 
the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the nearest gaap measure as required under the securities and exchange commission rules

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview teleflex strives to maintain a portfolio of businesses that provide consistency of performance  improved profitability and sustainable growth 
we are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth through our internal growth initiatives  which include the development of new products  expansion of market share  moving existing products into new geographies  and through selected acquisitions which enhance or expedite our development initiatives and our ability to grow market share 
over the past several years  we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio through acquisitions  principally in our medical segment  and divestitures in both our aerospace and commercial segments 
these portfolio actions resulted in a significant expansion of our medical segment operations and a significant reduction in our aerospace and commercial segment operations 
as a result  our medical segment now accounts for over of our revenues from continuing operations and over of our segment operating profit 
the following bullet points summarize our more significant acquisitions and divestitures  which occurred in and the results for the acquired businesses are included in the respective segments 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding our significant acquisitions and divestitures 
medical segment october acquired arrow international  inc  a leading global supplier of catheter based medical technology products used for vascular access and cardiac care  for approximately billion 
april acquired substantially all of the assets of hdj company  inc  providers of engineering and manufacturing services to medical device manufacturers  for approximately million 
commercial segment september divested business units that design and manufacture heavy duty truck and locomotive auxiliary power units  truck and bus climate control systems  and components and systems for the use of alternative fuels in industrial vehicles and passenger cars with annual revenues of approximately million  for approximately million in cash 
december divested business units that design and manufacture automotive and industrial driver controls  motion systems and fluid handling systems the gms businesses with revenues of over million  for million in cash 
april acquired substantially all of the assets of southern wire corporation  a wholesale distributor of wire rope cables and related hardware  for approximately million 
aerospace segment march divested our interest in airfoil technologies international singapore pte 
ltd 
ati singapore  which provides engine repair technologies and services primarily for critical components of flight turbines  including fan blades  compressors and airfoils  with annual revenues of approximately million  for approximately million in cash 
november acquired nordisk aviation products a s  a global leader in developing  manufacturing  and servicing containers and pallets for air cargo  for approximately million 
june divested teleflex aerospace manufacturing group tamg  a precision machined components business with revenues of approximately million  for approximately million in cash 
we incurred significant indebtedness to fund a portion of the consideration for our october acquisition of arrow 
as of december   our outstanding indebtedness was approximately billion  down from billion as of december   primarily due to the use of million of the proceeds from the sale of the ati businesses to repay and reduce indebtedness 
for additional information regarding our indebtedness  please see liquidity and capital resources below and note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
global economic conditions the global recessionary conditions that prevailed throughout have had an adverse impact on market activities including  among other things  failure of financial institutions  falling asset values  diminished liquidity  and reduced demand for products and services 
at teleflex  these economic developments principally affected our aerospace and commercial segments during  and  in response  we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities 
although  on a consolidated basis  the economic conditions did not have a significant adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during  the continuation of the broad economic trends could adversely affect our operations in the future  as described below 
the potential effect of these factors on our current and future liquidity is discussed below under liquidity and capital resources in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
medical our medical segment serves a diverse base of hospitals and healthcare providers in more than countries 
healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country  and the impact of the global economic downturn was primarily felt in our us and asian markets during european healthcare markets were less affected due to the predominantly public funding mechanisms in those systems 
hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions  a weaker payor mix  and a reduction in elective procedures 
hospitals consequently took actions to reduce their costs  including limiting their capital spending  and distributors in the supply chain reduced inventory levels during the impact of these actions were most pronounced in capital goods markets  which affected our surgical instrument and cardiac assist businesses  and in the orthopedic sector which impacted our orthopedic oem business 
approximately percent of our medical revenues come from disposable products used in critical care and surgical applications  and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix decline further as a result of continuing high unemployment rates and subsequent loss of insurance coverage by consumers 
although the impact of the global recession outside the united states has been less pronounced to date  funding for foreign healthcare institutions could be affected in the future as governments make further spending adjustments and enact versions of healthcare reform to lower overall healthcare costs 
during  the public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe  most notably greece  spain  portugal and italy  have experienced reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions which has resulted in a slow down in payments to us 
we believe this situation will be with us until these countries are able to find alternative funding sources to their respective public healthcare sectors 
in  sales into the public hospital systems in these countries were approximately of our total sales 
distributors in certain asian markets were negatively impacted by credit availability and large swings in currency values early in but returned to more normal order patterns later in the year 
significant fundamental changes are currently being proposed to the healthcare system in the us the us house of representatives and senate passed versions of health care reform legislation late in the bills in their current form contain provisions that i mandate health insurance coverage  ii introduce various insurance market reforms and iii seek to finance the cost of health care reform by reductions in medicare and medicaid reimbursement and the levy of a variety of payroll taxes and fees on individuals and employers  including the imposition of fees on medical device manufacturers  such as teleflex 
the potential impact of these reforms remains uncertain 
the addition of significant numbers of currently uninsured patients into the healthcare system could spur additional volume demand for our products 
however  reductions in medicare and medicaid reimbursement could negatively affect pricing 
we continue to study the evolution of the house and senate bills  but until legislation is passed in final form  we will be unable to ascertain the anticipated impact on teleflex 
aerospace sudden and significant increases in fuel costs in mid resulted in reductions in capacity for passenger and cargo traffic  and accelerated retirement of older  less fuel efficient aircraft 
these trends were exacerbated by the economic crisis in even though fuel prices have decreased from these record levels 
the sharp drop in fuel costs toward the end of was a positive development for airlines  as it offset somewhat the recession related drop in revenues for both passenger and cargo traffic 
although lower traffic makes it more difficult to sell cargo containment equipment due to reduced demand  new aircraft production and weight and greenhouse gas reduction objectives create some opportunities in these markets 
despite the fact that our installed base of equipment continues to grow  short term lower overall aircraft utilization will reduce demand for spare parts and repair services in all three of our aerospace businesses 
nevertheless  we are well positioned on certain new airbus and boeing airframes and deliveries of cargo handling systems are expected to continue at previously expected levels overall  albeit on a slightly longer time horizon than what we initially anticipated 
commercial the markets served by our commercial segment are largely affected by the general state of the economy and by consumer confidence 
factors such as housing starts  home values  fuel costs  environmental and other regulatory matters all affect the market outlook for the businesses in this segment 
very high fuel prices in began a trend of declining demand in the recreational marine market and the global recession that followed caused this trend to continue in in spite of moderating fuel costs 
although we experienced continued softness in the markets for new boats  aftermarket sales of replacement parts grew in the second half of our rigging services business was adversely impacted by sharp drops in construction activity and in oil and gas exploration in we expect that growth will be a challenge in our commercial segment until there is a return to global economic growth and improvement in consumer confidence 
results of operations discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a purchased company for up to twelve months beyond the date of acquisition 
activity beyond the initial twelve months is considered core growth 
core growth excludes the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from year to year and the comparable activity of divested companies within the most recent twelve month period 
the following comparisons exclude the impact of the operations of the ati businesses  power systems  tamg  and the gms businesses which have been presented in our consolidated financial results as discontinued operations see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k and discontinued operations in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion of discontinued operations 
revenues dollars in millions net revenues net revenues decreased approximately to billion in from billion in reduced revenues from core business caused of the decline while foreign currency movements caused the other of the decline 
as a result of core growth in the fourth quarter in the medical segment  core revenue in that segment was flat in compared to  but core revenue declined in the aerospace and commercial segments and  respectively in compared to weak global economic conditions have negatively impacted markets served by our aerospace and commercial segments throughout net revenues increased approximately to billion in from billion in businesses acquired in accounted for almost all of this increase in revenues  as foreign currency translation contributed to revenue growth  while revenues from core business were essentially unchanged compared to core revenue growth in the medical and aerospace segments was offset by a decline in core revenues in the commercial segment  which was primarily due to a significant decrease in sales of recreational marine products 
gross profit dollars in millions gross profit percentage of sales gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in with all three segments experiencing increases in gross profit as a percentage of revenues 
the principal factors that impact the overall increase were a higher percentage of medical revenues of total revenues in compared to in  a million fair value adjustment to inventory in the first quarter of related to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition  which did not recur in  synergies from the arrow acquisition and manufacturing cost reductions implemented in each of our three segments  partly offset by higher pension expense in because of the decline in the value of our pension assets at the end of as a result of losses experienced in the global equity markets 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in this trend was driven by increases in the medical and aerospace segments as the gross profit percentage in the commercial segment was unchanged from improved margins in the medical segment were largely due to the inclusion of higher margin arrow critical care product lines for the full year in compared to only the fourth quarter in and volume related manufacturing efficiencies in the medical oem product line 
improved margins in the aerospace segment were principally due to a shift in sales favoring engine repair services and away from sales of lower margin replacement parts in the engine repairs business 
selling  engineering and administrative dollars in millions selling  engineering and administrative percentage of sales selling  engineering and administrative expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were in compared to in the increase in the amount as a percentage of revenues is due to the year on year decline in revenues 
the reduction in the dollar value of these costs was principally the result of cost reduction initiatives throughout the company  including restructuring and integration activities in connection with the arrow acquisition and the commercial segment restructuring program  and lower spending on remediation of fda regulatory issues 
these factors resulted in an aggregate reduction in expenses of approximately million 
selling  engineering and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were in compared to in  principally due to approximately million higher amortization expense related to the arrow acquisition and approximately million higher expenses in the medical segment related to the remediation of fda regulatory issues 
goodwill impairment and in process r d charge dollars in millions goodwill impairment in process r d charge in  we performed an interim review of goodwill for our cargo container reporting unit during the second quarter as a result of the difficult market conditions confronting the cargo container reporting unit and the significant deterioration in its operating performance  which accelerated in the second quarter of upon conclusion of this review  we determined that goodwill in the cargo container operations was impaired  and we recorded an impairment charge of million in the second quarter of in  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge related to a write down to the agreed selling price of one of our variable interest entities in the commercial segment 
the million write off of in process research and development costs in is related to in process r d projects acquired in the arrow acquisition which we determined had no alternative future use in their current state 
interest income and expense dollars in millions interest expense average interest rate on debt during the year interest income interest expense decreased in due to an approximate million reduction in debt during the year  principally reflecting the million of debt repaid in the first quarter of from the proceeds of the sale of the ati business 
interest expense increased significantly in compared to principally as a result of the full year impact of the debt incurred in connection with the arrow acquisition in october interest income decreased in compared to primarily due to lower amounts of invested funds combined with lower average interest rates 
taxes on income from continuing operations effective income tax rate the effective tax rate in was compared to in taxes on income from continuing operations in were million compared to million in the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to i a decrease in deferred state tax liabilities driven by changes to applicable state tax laws and ii a reduction in the current year for reserves for uncertain tax positions as audits and settlements were closed  and fewer new reserves were established than in the prior year 
the effective tax rate in was compared to in taxes on income from continuing operations of million in include discrete income tax charges incurred in connection with the arrow acquisition 
specifically  in connection with funding the acquisition of arrow  the company i repatriated approximately million of cash from foreign subsidiaries which had previously been deemed to be permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions  and ii changed its position with respect to certain additional previously untaxed foreign earnings to treat these earnings as no longer permanently reinvested 
these items resulted in a discrete income tax charge in of approximately million 
the company did not incur similar charges in or restructuring and other impairment charges dollars in millions commercial restructuring program arrow integration program restructuring programs restructuring and divestiture program impairment charges total in december  we began certain restructuring initiatives that affect the commercial segment 
these initiatives involved the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at three of our facilities in europe and north america 
we implemented these initiatives as a means to address an expected continuation of weakness in the marine and industrial markets 
these costs amounted to approximately million during as of december   we have completed the commercial segment restructuring program 
we expect to have realized annual pre tax savings of between million in as a result of actions taken in connection with this program 
in connection with the acquisition of arrow during  we formulated a plan related to the integration of arrow and our other medical businesses 
the integration plan focused on the closure of arrow corporate functions and the consolidation of manufacturing  sales  marketing  and distribution functions in north america  europe and asia 
costs related to actions that affect employees and facilities of arrow have been included in the allocation of the purchase price of arrow 
costs related to actions that affect employees and facilities of teleflex are charged to earnings and included in restructuring and impairment charges within the consolidated statement of operations 
these costs amounted to approximately million during as of december   we estimate that the aggregate of future restructuring and impairment charges that we will incur in connection with the arrow integration plan are approximately million in of this amount  million relates to employee termination costs  million relates to contract termination costs associated with the termination of leases and certain distribution agreements and million relates to other restructuring costs 
we also have incurred restructuring related costs in the medical segment which do not qualify for classification as restructuring costs 
in these costs amounted to million and are reported in the medical segment s operating results in materials  labor and other product costs and in selling  engineering and administrative expenses 
we expect to have realized annual pre tax savings of between million by the end of when these integration and restructuring actions are complete 
in june  we began certain restructuring initiatives that affected all three of our operating segments 
these initiatives involved the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at several of our facilities in europe and north america 
we took these initiatives as a means to improving operating performance and to better leverage our existing resources and these activities are now complete 
for additional information regarding our restructuring programs  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
during the second quarter of  we recorded million in impairment charges with respect to an intangible asset in our commercial segment 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a million impairment charge related to our investment in a california real estate venture 
in  we contributed property and other assets that had been part of one of our former manufacturing sites to the real estate venture 
during the third quarter of  based on continued deterioration in the california real estate market  we concluded that our investment was not recoverable and recorded the impairment charge to fully write off our investment in this venture 
impairment charges in included million related to five of our minority held investments precipitated by the deteriorating economic conditions in the fourth quarter of  million related to an intangible asset in the commercial segment that was identified during the annual impairment testing process  and a million reduction in the carrying value of a building held for sale 
in  we determined that two minority held investments and a building held for sale were impaired and recorded an aggregate charge of million

net sales for  and by product group for the medical segment are comprised of the following year ended december increase decrease vs vs dollars in millions critical care surgical care cardiac care oem other net revenues disposable medical products for critical care the decrease in critical care product sales during compared to was entirely due to currency fluctuations as core revenue in this product group increased approximately in higher sales of vascular access  urology and anesthesia products of approximately million were partially offset by approximately million lower sales of respiratory products  principally as a result of distributor de stocking in north america in early surgical instruments and medical devices surgical product sales declined approximately in compared to foreign currency movements negatively impacted sales by approximately  and lower sales in the instrumentation product line in europe and north america led the decline in core revenue 
we believe this decline in sales resulted from hospitals limiting their capital budgets for these products and distributors reducing inventory in the supply chain 
cardiac care devices the decrease in sales of cardiac care products in compared to is mainly due to currency movements  hospital capital budget constraints and a voluntary product recall during the first quarter of devices for original equipment manufacturers oem sales of devices to oems decreased primarily as a result of approximately million lower sales of orthopedic instrumentation as higher sales of specialty sutures and other devices of approximately million was offset by the impact of currency movements 
a reduction in new product launches by oem customers and overall weakness in oem orthopedic markets due to hospital budgetary constraints and postponement of certain elective surgical procedures have had a negative impact on demand for our orthopedic instrumentation products 
operating profit in the medical segment increased in to million  from million in the negative impact on operating profit from a stronger us dollar during the first three quarters of was more than offset by approximately million of lower manufacturing and selling  general and administrative costs during as a result of cost reduction initiatives  including restructuring and integration activities in connection with the arrow acquisition  and approximately million lower expenses related to the remediation of fda regulatory issues 
also  a million expense for fair value adjustment to inventory in the first quarter of related to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition  which did not recur in  had a favorable impact on the comparison of operating profit to the prior year 
during the first quarter  we undertook a voluntary recall of our custom iv tubing product 
estimated costs to be incurred for the recall are in a range of approximately million to million  pretax 
of that amount  million relates to units sold or produced in and is included in materials  labor and other product costs in the consolidated statement of income 
comparison of and medical segment net revenues grew in to  million  from  million in the acquisition of arrow accounted for of this increase in revenues 
of the remaining increase in net revenues  was due to foreign currency fluctuations and was due to core revenue growth 
medical segment core revenue growth in reflects higher sales volume for critical care and surgical products in europe and asia latin america of approximately million and million  respectively  and a million increase in sales of specialty medical devices to oems  partially offset by million lower sales volumes for critical care and surgical products in north america 
operating profit in the medical segment increased in to million  from million in  principally due to the addition of higher margin arrow critical care product lines 
other factors that contributed to the higher operating profit were improved cost and operational efficiencies in north america  higher volumes in europe and asia latin america  lower fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition million in versus million in and the favorable impact from the stronger euro 
the impact of these factors was partially offset by the impact of approximately million higher amortization expense related to the arrow acquisition and million in higher costs incurred in in connection with a plan to remediate fda regulatory issues 
aerospace comparison of and aerospace segment net revenues declined in to million  from million in core revenue reductions accounted for nearly all of the decline in revenue 
weakness in the commercial aviation sector throughout resulted in reduced sales to commercial airlines and freight carriers of wide body cargo spare components and repairs  cargo containers and actuators 
this market weakness has also reduced the number of aftermarket cargo system conversions  resulting in lower sales of multi deck wide body cargo handling systems  which offset the impact of higher sales of single deck wide body systems on passenger aircraft 
segment operating profit decreased in to million  from million in this decline was principally due to the sharply lower sales volumes across all product lines  including the unfavorable mix in of lower margin single deck system sales compared with a mix in that was weighted more toward aftermarket multi deck system conversions and spares and repairs 
the impact from lower sales volumes was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives that resulted in operating cost reductions of approximately million during comparison of and aerospace segment net revenues grew in to million  from million in the expansion of the cargo containers product line due to the acquisition of nordisk aviation products accounted for of this increase 
the increase in core growth is primarily attributable to increased sales of narrow body cargo loading systems and wide body and narrow body cargo spare components and repairs 
segment operating profit increased in to million  from million in the increase was principally due to the impact of the nordisk acquisition and favorable product mix of repair versus replacement in the engine repair services business as a result of technology investments we have made 
consolidation of operations and phasing out of lower margin product lines in the engine repair services business during also had a positive impact on operating profit in commercial comparison of and commercial segment net revenues declined approximately in to million  from million in core revenue reductions accounted for of the decline  which was principally the result of a decrease in demand for rigging services  and a decline in sales of marine products to oem manufacturers for the recreational boat market  partially offset by approximately million of higher sales of the modern burner unit to the us military 
in  segment operating profit decreased to million compared to million in this decrease was principally due to the lower sales volumes of rigging products and marine products to oem manufacturers for the recreational boat market and sale of higher cost inventory in the rigging services business  which more than offset the impact from the elimination of approximately million of operating costs in and higher sales of the modern burner unit to the us military 
comparison of and commercial segment net revenues declined approximately in to million  from million in core revenue declined as a result of a decline in sales of marine products for the recreational boat market offset by a increase in sales of rigging services products 
extreme volatility in fuel costs  accompanied by deterioration in the general state of the global economy in the second half of adversely impacted the markets served by our marine products 
in  segment operating profit decreased to million compared to million in this decrease was principally due to a lower operating profit in the marine business resulting from lower sales in and unfavorable currency impact of approximately million partially offset by an increase in the rigging services business due to an acquisition during discontinued operations during the third quarter of  we completed the sale of our power systems operations to fuel systems solutions  inc for million and realized a loss of million  net of tax 
during the second quarter  we recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million to adjust the carrying value of these operations to their estimated fair value 
in the third quarter of  we reported the power systems operations  including the goodwill impairment charge  in discontinued operations 
on march   we completed the sale of our percent ownership interest in ati singapore to ge pacific private limited for million in cash 
ati singapore  which provides engine repair products and services for critical components of flight turbines  was part of a joint venture between general electric company ge and us 
in december  we completed the transfer of our ownership interest in the remaining ati business together with ati singapore  the ati businesses to ge for a nominal amount 
at the end of  we completed the sale of our gms businesses to kongsberg automotive holding asa for million in cash 
in the second quarter of  we refined our estimates for the post closing adjustments based on the provisions of the purchase agreement with kongsberg automotive holdings on the sale of the gms businesses 
also during  we recorded a charge for the settlement of a contingency related to the sale of the gms businesses 
these activities resulted in a decrease in the gain on sale of the gms businesses and are reported in discontinued operations as a loss of million  net of taxes of million 
on june   we completed the sale of a precision machined components business in our aerospace segment for approximately million in cash 
the company has reported results of operations  cash flows and gains losses on the disposition of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further information regarding divestiture activity and accounting for discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows 
in addition to operating cash flows  other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures  acquisitions  pension funding  dividends  common stock repurchases  adequacy of available bank lines of credit  and access to other capital markets 
the global recessionary conditions that persisted throughout affected the operating results of our various businesses as described above in results of operations 
nevertheless  we currently do not foresee any difficulties in meeting our cash requirements or accessing credit as needed in the next twelve months 
to date  we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers  and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund additional operating needs 
however  in light of current economic conditions  there is an increased risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity 
if current market conditions deteriorate further  we may experience delays in customer payments and reductions in our customers purchases from us  which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
the precipitous deterioration in the securities markets that occurred during and the subsequent moderate recovery in these markets during has impacted the market value of the assets included in our defined benefit pension plans 
as a result of these market conditions  the market value of assets in our domestic pension funds declined in value by approximately million  or  during and recovered approximately million  or  in these events did not have a significant impact on our pension funding requirements in  nor do we expect a significant impact on funding requirements  because amounts funded to the plans in prior years exceeded the minimum amounts required in those years 
the volatility in the securities markets has not significantly affected the liquidity of our pension plans or counterparty exposure 
a majority of our domestic pension plans are invested in mutual funds registered with the sec under the investment company act of underlying holdings of the mutual funds are primarily invested in publicly traded equity and fixed income securities 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a cost effective basis 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences  however  those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations 
we have and will continue to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to the us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 
during we repatriated approximately million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries and we expect to access approximately million of cash from foreign subsidiaries in to help fund debt service and other cash requirements 
substantially all of our debt service requirements are united states based and we depend on foreign sources of cash to fund a portion of these requirements 
during we repaid approximately million of debt from the proceeds of the sale of businesses and from cash generated from operations 
as a result  we have no scheduled principal payments under our senior credit facility until september our next scheduled senior note principal payment is in july for million 
we anticipate our domestic interest payments for will be approximately million 
to the extent we cannot  or choose not to  repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries in time to meet quarterly debt service or other requirements our revolving credit facility can be utilized as a source of liquidity until such cash can be repatriated in a cost effective manner 
we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and additional sales of accounts receivable under our securitization program will enable us to fund our operating requirements  capital expenditures and debt obligations 
a summary of our cash flows for the last three years is as follows year ended december  dollars in millions cash flows from continuing operations provided by used in operating activities financing activities investing activities cash flows provided by discontinued operations effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flow from operating activities lower tax payments of approximately million  lower interest payments of approximately million and approximately million greater reduction in working capital were the primary contributors to the higher cash flow from operations in compared to changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in an aggregate decrease in cash from operations of approximately million during which was comprised of a reduction in taxes of approximately million offset by the impact from a reduction of working capital of approximately million 
the reduction in taxes includes million of taxes paid in connection with businesses divested in the reduction in working capital results principally from i lower accounts receivable  primarily in the commercial and aerospace segments generally  reflecting lower sales  partly offset by higher receivables in the medical segment due to a slow down in payments from public hospitals in italy  spain  portugal and greece where funding has been under pressure due to weak economic conditions  ii lower inventory due largely to efforts in both the aerospace and commercial segments in response to weak demand during  generally  coupled with deliveries of cargo handling systems in the aerospace segment whose delivery schedules had been delayed from into  partly offset by iii lower accounts payable and accrued expenses largely due to reduced spending on inventory in the aerospace and commercial segments coupled with payments of termination benefits and contract termination costs in restructuring and integration reserves 
higher tax payments of approximately million net of refunds of approximately million and higher interest payments of approximately million were the principal factors in the year on year decrease in cash flows from operating activities in compared to the largest factor contributing to the higher tax payments is approximately million of taxes paid in connection with businesses divested in changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in an aggregate decrease in cash from operations of approximately million during which is principally attributable to the million of tax payments mentioned previously 
the cash flow impact from changes in other operating assets and liabilities offset one another  an inventory increase of approximately million  increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  decrease in accounts receivable of million  and a decrease in other operating assets of million 
the ramp up in production of cargo handling systems to meet the delivery schedules communicated earlier in the year from aircraft manufacturers and the late in the year delay of those delivery schedules into was the principal million cause of the year on year increase in inventory 
nearly all of the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses is due to a year on year increase in accounts payable in the medical segment that results from changes in payment patterns to suppliers of the arrow operations during where early payment discounts were forgone in favor of longer payment terms 
the million decrease in accounts receivable reflects focused collection efforts in all segments and is in spite of higher sales during the fourth quarter of compared to the same period of a year ago  and a heavier mix of sales in our cargo handling systems business to aircraft manufacturers in which carry longer payment terms compared to the aftermarket side of that business 
during we repatriated approximately million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries 
cash flow from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations in consisted primarily of proceeds from the sales of the ati businesses and power systems operations  partly offset by capital expenditures of million 
our cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations in consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million  deferred payments of million with respect to acquired businesses  which primarily pertained to our acquisitions of nordisk million and southern wire million  and proceeds of million from the sale of assets and investments  principally million related to post closing adjustments in connection with the sale of the gms business  million derived from the sale of investments in non consolidated affiliates and million from the sale of a building held for sale 
cash flow from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations in consisted primarily of million repayment of long term debt and payment of dividends of million  partly offset by borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility 
our cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations in consisted primarily of million repayment of long term debt  million repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and payment of dividends of million  partly offset by borrowings under our revolving credit facility of million 
financing arrangements the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio dollars in thousands net debt includes current borrowings long term borrowings total debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt total capital includes net debt shareholders equity total capital percent of net debt to total capital in connection with our acquisition of arrow  in october  we entered into a credit agreement  which we refer to as our senior credit agreement  that provides for a five year term loan facility of billion and a five year revolving line of credit facility of million  both of which carried initial interest rates of libor plus a spread of basis points 
the spread is subject to adjustment based upon our consolidated leverage ratio generally  consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda  each as defined in the senior credit agreement 
at december   the spread over libor was basis points 
we executed an interest rate swap for million of the term loan from a floating month libor rate to a fixed rate of 
the notional value of the interest rate swap amortizes down to million at maturity in our obligations under the senior credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our material wholly owned domestic subsidiaries  and are secured by a pledge of the shares of certain of our subsidiaries 
also in connection with our acquisition of arrow  in october  we issued million in new senior notes  which we refer to as the notes  and amended certain terms of our outstanding notes issued in july  which we refer to as the notes  and october  which we refer to as the notes 
we collectively refer to the notes and the notes as the amended notes 
in addition  we repaid million of outstanding notes issued on november  and december   which we collectively refer to as the retired notes 
the retired notes consisted of the senior notes due november  and the series b senior notes due december  the notes and the amended notes  referred to collectively as the senior notes  rank pari passu in right of repayment with our obligations under our senior credit agreement and are secured and guaranteed in the same manner as the senior credit agreement 
the senior notes have mandatory prepayment requirements upon the sale of certain assets and may be accelerated upon certain events of default  in each case  on the same basis as our senior credit agreement 
the interest rates payable on the amended notes were also modified in connection with the foregoing transactions 
effective as of october  the notes bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at the following rates i in respect of the series tranche a senior notes due  ii in respect of the series tranche b senior notes due  and iii in respect of the series tranche c senior notes due  and the notes bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at the rate of per annum 
interest rates on the amended notes are subject to reduction based on positive performance relative to certain financial ratios 
during  we repaid the notes and attained a basis point reduction on the notes 
fixed rate borrowings  excluding the effect of derivative instruments  comprised of total borrowings at december  fixed rate borrowings  including the effect of derivative instruments  comprised of total borrowings at december  less than of our total borrowings of  million are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro 
our senior credit agreement and the senior note agreements contain covenants that  among other things  limit or restrict our ability  and the ability of our subsidiaries  to incur debt  create liens  consolidate  merge or dispose of certain assets  make certain investments  engage in acquisitions  pay dividends on  repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements 
these agreements also require us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than and a consolidated interest coverage ratio generally  consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense  each as defined in the senior credit agreement of not less than as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters calculated pursuant to the definitions and methodology set forth in the senior credit agreement 
at december  our consolidated leverage ratio was and our interest coverage ratio was  both of which are in compliance with the limits mentioned in the preceding sentence 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding and approximately million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our million revolving credit facility 
this facility is used principally for seasonal working capital needs 
the availability of loans under this facility is dependent upon our ability to maintain our financial condition and our continued compliance with the covenants contained in the senior credit agreement and senior note agreements 
moreover  additional borrowings would be prohibited if a material adverse effect as defined in the senior credit agreement were to occur 
notwithstanding these restrictions  we believe that this revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital needs 
at our current level of ebitda as defined in the senior credit agreement for the year ended december   we would have been permitted million of additional debt beyond the levels outstanding at december  notwithstanding the borrowing capacity described above  additional capacity would be available if borrowed funds were used to acquire a business or businesses through the purchase of assets or controlling equity interests so long as the aforementioned leverage and interest coverage ratios are met after calculating ebitda on a proforma basis to give effect to the acquisition 
as of december   we were in compliance with all other terms of the senior credit agreement and the senior notes  and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements  including the leverage and interest coverage ratios  throughout for additional information regarding our indebtedness  please see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
in addition  at december   the company had an accounts receivable securitization program under which it sells a security interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to million to a commercial paper conduit 
this facility is utilized from time to time for increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements 
the credit market volatility during did not have a material impact on the availability of the accounts receivable securitization program 
for additional information regarding this facility  please refer to off balance sheet arrangements included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
stock repurchase programs on june   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of outstanding company common stock 
repurchases of company stock under the board authorization may be made from time to time in the open market and may include privately negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory considerations 
the stock repurchase program has no expiration date and the company s ability to execute on the program will depend on  among other factors  cash requirements for acquisitions  cash generation from operations  debt repayment obligations  market conditions and regulatory requirements 
in addition  the company s senior loan agreements limit the aggregate amount of share repurchases and other restricted payments the company may make to million per year in the event the company s consolidated leverage ratio exceeds to accordingly  these provisions may limit the company s ability to repurchase shares under this board authorization 
through december   no shares have been purchased under this board authorization 
contractual obligations contractual obligations at december  are as follows payments due by period less more than than total year years years years dollars in thousands total borrowings interest obligations operating lease obligations minimum purchase obligations other postretirement benefits total contractual obligations interest obligations include the company s obligations under the interest rate swap 
interest payments on floating rate debt are based on the interest rate in effect on december  purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions 
these obligations relate primarily to material purchase requirements 
we have recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made 
in  cash contributions to all defined benefit pension plans were million  and we estimate the amount of cash contributions will be in the range of million to million in due to the potential impact of future plan investment performance  changes in interest rates and other economic and demographic assumptions and changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions  we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions that may be required to fund our defined benefit plans for periods beyond see notes and  respectively to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information 
off balance sheet arrangements we have residual value guarantees under operating leases for certain equipment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is approximately million 
we use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain access to credit markets with favorable interest rates and reduce financing costs 
as currently structured  accounts receivable of certain domestic subsidiaries are sold on a non recourse basis to a special purpose entity spe  which is a bankruptcy remote consolidated subsidiary of teleflex 
accordingly  the assets of the spe are not available to satisfy the obligations of teleflex or any of its other subsidiaries 
the spe then sells undivided interests in those receivables to an asset backed commercial paper conduit 
the conduit issues notes secured by those interests and other assets to third party investors 
to the extent that cash consideration is received for the sale of undivided interests in the receivables by the spe to the conduit  it is accounted for as a sale as we have relinquished control of the receivables 
accordingly  undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the commercial paper conduit under these transactions are excluded from accounts receivable  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the interests for which cash consideration is not received from the conduit are retained by the spe and remain in accounts receivable  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
however  as noted below  the accounting for accounts receivables sold will change beginning in the first quarter of the interests in receivables sold and the interest in receivables retained by the spe are carried at face value  which is due to the short term nature of our accounts receivable 
the spe has received cash consideration of million and million for the interests in the accounts receivable it has sold to the commercial paper conduit at december  and december   respectively 
no gain or loss is recorded upon sale as fee charges from the commercial paper conduit are based upon a floating yield rate and the period the undivided interests remain outstanding 
fee charges from the commercial paper conduit are accrued at the end of each month 
if we default under the accounts receivable securitization program  the commercial paper conduit is entitled to receive collections on receivables owned by the spe in satisfaction of the amount of cash consideration paid to the spe by the commercial paper conduit 
information regarding the outstanding balances related to the spe s interests in accounts receivables sold or retained as of december  is as follows dollars in millions interests in receivables sold outstanding interests in receivables retained  net of allowance for doubtful accounts deducted from accounts receivable  net in the consolidated balance sheets 
the delinquency ratio for the qualifying receivables represented of the total qualifying receivables as of december  the following table summarizes the activity related to our interests in accounts receivable sold for the years ended december  and december  december  december  dollars in millions proceeds from the sale of interest in accounts receivable repayments to conduit fees and charges recorded in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
other fee charges related to the sale of receivables to the commercial paper conduit for the year ended december  were not material 
we continue to service the receivables after they are sold to the conduit pursuant to servicing agreements with the spe 
no servicing asset is recorded at the time of sale because we do not receive any servicing fees from third parties or other income related to the servicing of the receivables 
we do not record any servicing liability at the time of the sale as the receivables collection period is relatively short and the costs of servicing the receivables sold over the servicing period are insignificant 
servicing costs are recognized as incurred over the servicing period 
in the first quarter of  we will adopt an amendment to accounting standards codification asc topic  transfers and servicing that affects the accounting for transfers of financial assets 
outstanding accounts receivable that we previously treated as sold and removed from the balance sheet will be included in accounts receivable  net on our balance sheet and the amounts outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization program will be accounted for as a secured borrowing and reflected as short term debt on our balance sheet which as of december  is million for both 
in addition  while there has been no change in the arrangement under our securitization program  the adoption of this amendment will reduce cash flow from operations by approximately million and result in a corresponding increase in cash flow from financing activities 
see also note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates  which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts in the ordinary course of business  we grant non interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms 
in an effort to reduce our credit risk  we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships  ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers receivables  and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer s outstanding receivable balance 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts receivable based on our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable  considering the period an account is outstanding  the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services 
the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  and million at december  which was of gross accounts receivable at those respective dates 
in light of the disruptions in global credit markets that occurred in the fourth quarter of and continued through we have taken this heightened risk of customer payment default into account when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  by engaging in a more robust customer by customer risk assessment 
although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results  management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience 
however  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur  additional allowances may be required 
inventory utilization inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
accordingly  we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of our inventories for the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence  damage or other issues affecting marketability equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates  ii estimates of future demand  iii competitive pricing pressures  iv new product introductions  v product expiration dates  and vi component and packaging obsolescence 
the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
in assessing historical usage  we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 
our excess and obsolete inventory reserve was million at december  and million at december  which was and of gross inventories  at those respective dates 
accounting for long lived assets and investments the ability to realize long lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including undiscounted cash flow projections 
the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment 
any impairment loss  if indicated  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets by reporting segment at december  are as follows medical aerospace commercial total dollars in thousands goodwill intangible assets indefinite lived finite lived goodwill and intangible assets number of reporting units acquired intangible assets may represent indefinite lived assets eg  certain trademarks or brands  determinable lived intangibles eg  certain trademarks or brands  customer relationships  patents and technologies or residual goodwill 
of these  only the costs of determinable lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life 
the value of the indefinite lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized  but is tested at least annually for impairment 
our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangibles 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles assets  primarily trademarks and brand names  are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter  using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date  or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value 
assumptions used in the company s impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 
goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level 
for purposes of this assessment  the company s reporting units are generally its businesses one level below the respective operating segment 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
in performing the first step  the company calculated fair values of the various reporting units using equal weighting of two methods  one which estimates the discounted cash flows dcf of each of the reporting units based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar assets in actual transactions the market approach 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  there is no impairment 
if the reporting unit carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment 
the more significant judgments and assumptions made to determine the fair value of our reporting units were the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales  operating income  industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units  the expected long term growth rates for each of our reporting units which approximate the expected long term growth rate of the global economy and of the respective industries in which the reporting units operate  discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs  relevant comparable company selection  and calculation of comparable company multiples 
there were no changes to the underlying methods used in the current year as compared to the prior year valuations of our reporting units 
the dcf analysis utilized in the fourth quarter impairment test was performed over a ten year time horizon for each reporting unit where the compound growth rates during this period range from approximately to for revenue and from approximately to for operating income 
discount rates were for reporting units in the medical segment and for reporting units in the aerospace and commercial segments 
a perpetual growth rate of was assumed for all reporting units 
in arriving at our estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit  we considered the results of both the dcf and the market comparable methods and concluded the fair value to be the average of the results yielded by the two methods for each reporting unit 
then  the current market capitalization of the company was reconciled to the sum of the estimated fair values of the individual reporting units  plus a control premium  to ensure the fair value conclusions were reasonable in light of current market capitalization 
the control premium implied by our analysis was approximately  which was deemed to be within a reasonable range of observed average industry control premiums 
no impairment in the carrying value of any of our reporting units was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above 
the fair values of our reporting units whose assets include goodwill  other than the north america reporting unit within the medical segment  exceed their respective carrying values by to 
for the medical north america reporting unit  the fair value is approximately higher than its carrying value and at approximately million the goodwill attributed to the medical north america reporting unit is approximately of our total goodwill 
our expected future growth rates are based on our estimates of future sales  operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year which  together  more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle 
as a result of this analysis  the compound annual growth rate of sales and cash flows over the projected ten year period in the medical north america reporting unit is estimated to be and  respectively 
under the income approach  significant changes in assumptions would be required for this reporting unit to fail the step one test 
for example  an increase of over one and a quarter percent in the discount rate or a decrease of over percent in the compound annual growth rate of operating income would be required 
intangible assets intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill 
intangible assets obtained through acquisitions are comprised mainly of technology  customer relationships  and trade names 
the fair value of acquired technology and trade names is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method  which values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset 
under this method  an owner of an intangible asset determines the arms length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party 
the royalty  which is based on a reasonable rate applied against forecasted sales  is tax effected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset 
the fair value of acquired customer relationships is estimated by the use of an income approach known as the excess earnings method 
the excess earnings method measures economic benefit indirectly by calculating residual profit attributable to an asset after appropriate returns are paid to complementary or contributory assets 
the residual profit is tax effected and discounted to present value at an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the estimated income stream 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
management tests indefinite lived intangible assets on at least an annual basis  or more frequently if necessary 
in connection with the analysis  management tests for impairment by comparing the carrying value of intangible assets to their estimated fair values 
since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets  we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value 
common among such approaches is the relief from royalty methodology described above  under which management estimates the direct cash flows associated with the intangible asset 
management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate  discount rate  and residual growth rate to estimate the forecasted cash flows associated with the asset 
discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the impairment test of indefinite lived assets during the fourth quarter of are comparable to the rates utilized in the impairment test of goodwill by segment 
compound annual growth rates in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade names in the medical segment ranged from to and a royalty rate of was assumed 
the compound annual growth rate in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade names in the commercial segment was and a royalty rate of was assumed 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated as a result of the respective intangible assets 
assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar trademarks or technologies are being licensed in the marketplace 
no impairment in the carrying value of any of our trade names was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above  nor would impairment be evident had the fair value of each company s indefinite lived assets been hypothetically lower than presently estimated by as of september  we are not required to perform an annual impairment test for long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets eg  customer relationships  instead  long lived assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event 
triggering events include the likely ie  more likely than not disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets 
significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and re assessing the reasonableness of the remaining useful lives of finite lived assets by  among other things  validating customer attrition rates 
acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of arrow international  the company recorded a million charge to operations during for in process research and development ipr d assets acquired that the company determined had no alternative future use in their current state 
this amount represents the estimated value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to in process projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of the date of the acquisition 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products 
the value assigned to the acquired in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projections used to value the acquired in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects were based on our estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from such projects 
the rate of percent utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value was based on estimated cost of capital calculations and the implied rate of return from the company s acquisition model plus a risk premium 
due to the nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the developmental projects  appropriate risk adjusted discount rates were used for the in process research and development projects 
the discount rates are based on the stage of completion and uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology projects 
the purchased in process technology of arrow relates to research and development projects in the central venus access catheters  peripherally inserted catheters and specialty care catheters product families 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement healthcare 
several statistical and other factors which are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans 
these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates  expected rates of return on plan assets  compensation increases  turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates 
we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
the weighted average assumptions for us and foreign plans used in determining net benefit cost were as follows pension other benefits discount rate rate of return initial healthcare trend rate ultimate healthcare trend rate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
the following table shows the sensitivity to changes in the weighted average assumptions assumed discount expected return rate on plan assets assumed healthcare basis basis basis trend rate point point point increase decrease change increase decrease dollars in millions net periodic pension and postretirement healthcare expense projected benefit obligation product warranty liability we warrant to the original purchaser of certain of our products that we will  at our option  repair or replace  without charge  such products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect 
warranty periods vary by product 
we have recourse provisions for certain products that would enable recovery from third parties for amounts paid under the warranty 
we accrue for product warranties when  based on available information  it is probable that customers will make claims under warranties relating to products that have been sold  and a reasonable estimate of the costs based on historical claims experience relative to sales can be made 
our estimated product warranty liability was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
share based compensation we estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods 
share based compensation expense is measured using a multiple point black scholes option pricing model that takes into account highly subjective and complex assumptions 
the expected life of options granted is derived from the vesting period of the award  as well as historical exercise behavior  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
expected volatilities are based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock  which we believe is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option 
accounting for income taxes our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties  make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates 
we conduct a broad range of operations around the world  subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions  resulting at times in tax audits  disputes and potential litigation  the outcome of which is uncertain 
management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates  which the company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled 
the likelihood of a material change in the company s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks  final us and foreign tax settlements  and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions 
while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities and such adjustments could be material 
we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we evaluate all positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events  including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized 
based on this assessment  we evaluate the need for  and amount of  valuation allowances to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future  adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million and million at december  and december   respectively  relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets  primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 
we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax asset 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions under asc topic income taxes  which requires that a valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance decrease in was primarily attributable to the sale of entities associated with power systems operations  utilization of certain foreign net operating losses and movement in unrealized gain loss in relation to pension valuation 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold  as defined under the income taxes topic  which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
in the normal course of business  the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
specifically  we are currently in the midst of examinations by the us and german taxing authorities with respect to our income tax returns for those countries for various tax years 
the ultimate outcomes of the examinations of these returns could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities  which could impact our financial results

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain financial risks  specifically fluctuations in market interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and  to a lesser extent  commodity prices 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks 
all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes 
we are also exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances 
an interest rate swap is used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk 
the table below is an analysis of the amortization and related interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
variable interest rates shown below are weighted average rates of the debt portfolio based on december  rates 
for the swap  the notional amount and the related interest rate is shown by year of maturity 
the fair value  net of tax  of the interest rate swap as of december  was a loss of million reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
year of maturity thereafter total dollars in thousands fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate amount subject to swaps variable to fixed average rate to be received months usd libor average rate to be paid the notional value of the interest rate swap was million at inception and amortizes down to a notional value of million at maturity in as of december   the notional value of the interest rate swap was million 
the all in cost of the million swapped debt is plus the applicable spread over libor  which at december  was basis points 
a change in variable interest rates would adversely or positively impact our expected net earnings by approximately million  for the year ended december  foreign currency risk we are exposed to fluctuations in market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries 
we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures 
these are primarily contracts to buy or sell a foreign currency against the us dollar 
the fair value of the open forward contracts as of december  was a gain of million 
the following table presents our open forward currency contracts as of december   which mature in forward contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the stated currencies in thousands 
the total notional amount for all contracts translates to approximately million 
forward currency contracts buy sell japanese yen united states dollars south african rand euros mexican peso czech koruna swedish krona malaysian ringgits canadian dollars singapore dollars a strengthening of in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies would  on a combined basis  adversely impact the translation of our non us subsidiary net earnings and transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries by approximately million  for the year ended december
