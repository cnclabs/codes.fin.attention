item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the net loss available to common stockholders for sandy spring bancorp  inc and subsidiaries the company for the year ended december   totaled million per diluted common share  as compared to net income available to common stockholders of million per diluted common share for the prior year 
these results reflect the following events a decrease in net interest income due primarily to a lack of loan demand that caused the company to invest funds generated by its successful deposit acquisition program into lower yielding investment securities as compared to our lending products 
net interest income for the year was also adversely affected by the growth in average non performing loans 
these factors resulted in a net interest margin decrease to in from in an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses to million in from million in due mainly to higher charge offs  increases in internal risk rating downgrades and specific reserves on a higher level of non performing loans primarily in the residential real estate development portfolio 
a decrease of in non interest income compared to the prior year due to declines in service charges on deposit accounts  fees on sales of investment products and insurance agency commissions 
these decreases were somewhat offset by increases in gains on sales of mortgage loans and other non interest income 
an increase of in non interest expenses compared to the prior year due primarily to increases in fdic insurance premiums  salaries and benefits expenses and other non interest expenses 
excluding a one time special assessment by the fdic in and a goodwill impairment charge and a pre tax pension credit in  non interest expenses increased over the national and regional economies continued to reflect recessionary pressures and a soft real estate market  in addition to some market volatility 
these forces exerted extraordinary pressures on virtually all facets of bank performance 
credit issues presented the primary challenges during the past year 
the bank s management team addressed these issues aggressively through the addition of experienced staff and developing more sophisticated reporting tools in order to enhance its ability to identify problem credits at an early stage 
as the year drew to a close  the bank s emphasis shifted from identification of problem credits to resolution of these credits  which reflects the natural evolution of such a process 
the net interest margin declined to in compared to in as market rates remained at historically low levels throughout the year 
deposits increased  over the prior year due primarily to the introduction of a new deposit product in an effort to grow market share and improve liquidity 
much of this deposit growth was deployed into investment securities  which grew by over the prior year  as the loan portfolio declined due to soft demand and the application of strict underwriting standards employed by the company 
as a result of these trends  the net interest margin declined compared to the prior year due to the decline in the loan portfolio  the increase in non performing loans and the relatively lower rates earned on a much larger investment portfolio 
due to the growth in investment securities mentioned previously together with a restructuring of its borrowing lines with the federal home loan bank of atlanta and the federal reserve in the prior year  the company maintained a strong level of liquidity during the past year 
the company continued to experience a higher level of credit risk than in prior years 
the company saw non performing assets increase to million in from million in primarily due to conditions in its residential real estate development portfolio 
non performing loans in the commercial real estate and residential mortgage portfolios increased as well but to a lesser extent 
the company has added experienced staff and developed more sophisticated reporting tools in order to aggressively manage such problem credits as it has moved from identifying such problem credits to the logical next phase of sale and resolution of such credits 
lastly  but as important  is capital adequacy 
despite the challenges discussed above  the company has remained above all well capitalized regulatory requirement levels 
the company has maintained the preferred stock sold in under the us treasury s capital purchase program to retain an added margin of capital 
comparing december  balances to december   total assets increased to billion 
loan balances decreased by compared to the prior year primarily due to decreases of in residential mortgage and construction loans and in commercial loans 
these declines were a result of soft loan demand due to economic conditions  stringent underwriting standards implemented by the company and a higher level of loan charge offs 
customer funding sources  which include deposits plus other short term borrowings from core customers  increased over this growth was accomplished largely due to the company s implementation of a strategy to grow its market share of deposits by capitalizing on opportunities resulting from acquisitions of local banks in its market by other banks 
as the centerpiece of this deposit gathering effort  the company introduced its new money market deposit product  which was very competitively priced to develop new multi product customer relationships as a base to fund long term growth within the company s market 
as a result of low loan demand  funds generated through deposit growth were used to purchase investment securities  which increased 
during the same period  stockholders equity decreased to million or of total assets 
net interest income decreased by million  or  mainly due to a basis point decline in the yield on interest earning assets which exceeded a decrease of basis points in the cost of interest bearing liabilities and the impact of the growth in non performing assets 
the net interest margin decreased from for the year to for the year non interest income decreased by to million compared to the prior year 
this increase was due primarily to a decrease of million in service charges on deposit accounts 
in addition  fees on sales of investment products and insurance agency commissions both decreased million compared to the prior year 
these decreases were somewhat offset by increases of million in gains on sales of mortgages and million in other non interest income 
non interest income totaled of total revenue  which is composed of net interest income and non interest income 
non interest expenses increased million or over the prior year 
this increase in expenses was due primarily to an increase of million in fdic insurance premiums  which included a one time special assessment in of million 
in addition  salaries and benefits expenses increased million or over the prior year due primarily to a million pre tax pension credit in these increases were partially offset by a pre tax impairment charge of million to write down the remaining value of goodwill in the company s leasing subsidiary  the equipment leasing company in non performing assets increased substantially to million at december  compared to million at december  this increase was due primarily to the effect of current market conditions on the company s residential real estate development portfolio 
non performing assets represented of total assets at year end  versus at year end the ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases was in  compared to in critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements may reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently rely to a greater extent on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary for assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value 
a decline in the assets required to be recorded at fair values will warrant an impairment write down or valuation allowance to be established 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when readily available 
the following accounting policies  read in conjunction with the applicable portions of note significant accounting polices of the consolidated financial statements  comprise those policies that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results allowance for loan and lease losses  goodwill impairment  accounting for income taxes  fair value measurements  including assessment of other than temporary impairment  defined benefit pension plan 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in the loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting the requirement that a loss be accrued when it is probable that the loss has occurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated and the requirement that losses be accrued when it is probable that the company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the loan s or lease s contractual terms 
management believes that the allowance is adequate 
however  its determination requires significant judgment  and estimates of probable losses in the loan and lease portfolio can vary significantly from the amounts actually observed 
while management uses available information to recognize probable losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in the loans and leases comprising the portfolio and changes in the financial condition of borrowers  such as may result from changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  and independent consultants engaged by the company  periodically review the loan and lease portfolio and the allowance 
such review may result in additional provisions based on their judgments of information available at the time of each examination 
the company s allowance for loan and lease losses has two basic components a general reserve reflecting historical losses by loan category  as adjusted by several factors whose effects are not reflected in historical loss ratios  and specific allowances for separately identified loans 
each of these components  and the systematic allowance methodology used to establish them  are described in detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  the amount of the allowance is reviewed monthly by the credit risk committee of the board of directors and formally approved quarterly by that same committee of the board 
the general reserve portion of the allowance that is based upon historical loss factors  as adjusted  establishes allowances for the major loan categories based upon adjusted historical loss experience over the prior eight quarters  weighted so that losses realized in the most recent quarters have the greatest effect 
the use of these historical loss factors is intended to reduce the differences between estimated losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and actual losses 
the factors used to adjust the historical loss ratios address changes in the risk characteristics of the company s loan and lease portfolio that are related to trends in delinquencies and other non performing loans  changes in the risk level of the loan portfolio related to large loans  changes in the categories of loans comprising the loan portfolio  concentrations of loans to specific industry segments  changes in economic conditions on both a local and national level  changes in the company s credit administration and loan and lease portfolio management processes  and quality of the company s credit risk identification processes 
this component comprised of the total allowance at december  and at december  the specific allowance is used primarily to establish allowances for risk rated credits on an individual basis  and accounted for of the total allowance at december  and at december  the actual occurrence and severity of losses involving risk rated credits can differ substantially from estimates  and some risk rated credits may not be identified 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of the fair value of liabilities assumed over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
impairment testing requires that the fair value of each of the company s reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of its net assets  including goodwill 
the company s reporting units were identified based upon an analysis of each of its individual operating segments 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the company to use a high degree of subjectivity 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than book value  an expense may be required on the company s books to write down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value 
the company tests for impairment of goodwill as of october of each year  and again at any quarter end if any triggering events occur during a quarter that may affect goodwill 
examples of such events include  but are not limited to adverse action by a regulator or a loss of key personnel 
for this testing the company typically works together with a third party valuation firm to perform a step one test for potential goodwill impairment 
the company and the valuation firm determined that a combination of the income approach and the market approach were most appropriate in testing whether a step two test for impairment was necessary 
at september  it was determined that there was no evidence of impairment of goodwill or intangibles 
throughout  the company was trading below its book value consistent with its peer group 
however during the fourth quarter the market value of the company s stock declined significantly below its tangible book value at december  management considered this decrease to be a triggering event indicating the possibility of impairment in the community banking and other segments at december  the company engaged a third party valuation specialist to assist management in the determination of the fair value of the community banking segment as estimated using an income approach discounted future benefits method along with a market approach guideline public company method 
two additional methodologies based on market approaches were also performed which focused on the stock price of the company 
significant assumptions used in the above methods include an estimated control premium based on management s estimate of the cost savings that would be available to an acquirer 
a discount rate equal to price to book ratio of price to trailing twelve months income of  and price to assets of 
all methods were subjected to sensitivity analysis which included application of differing weightings of the respective methods to obtain a range of fair values for the community banking segment 
based on the lowest fair value within the range management determined that the community banking segment failed step of the two step impairment analysis and needed to perform additional valuation analysis to determine whether the goodwill attributed to the community banking segment was impaired and  if so  the amount of the impairment 
in performing the step analysis  the company determines the fair value of its assets and liabilities and deducts this amount from the fair value of the community banking segement as determined in step to imply a fair value of its goodwill in an acquisition 
the company utilized prices from recent comparable transactions in the mid atlantic region to value the company s core deposit intangibles and market quotes to value the investment portfolio 
an outside third party valuation specialist estimated the fair value of the loan portfolio using a discounted cash flow approach 
significant assumptions used in the loan portfolio valuation involved the stratification of the loan portfolio into pools based on their respective credit risk characteristics  the individual pool yields were compared to market yields in conjunction with their remaining months to maturity and prepayments speeds  and a credit loss factor was incorporated into the cash flows 
management performed a detailed review of all projections and their underlying assumptions 
the key assumptions used in the company s analysis involved the level of credit quality and thus the credit risk existing within each pool of the loan portfolio 
factors that could negatively affect the company s key assumptions involve the adverse performance of the national and regional economies in excess of the levels projected in the valuation models 
should the current regional economic recovery stall or reverse it could have a significant effect on the company s recovery from its recent performance trends 
the company determined at the conclusion of its step analysis that the fair value of the goodwill in the community banking segment exceeded its carrying value of million by million or  and that no impairment of goodwill existed at december  in addition  the market price of the company s stock has increased significantly since december  the stock is currently trading in the range 
as a result of its impairment assessment in  the company determined that the equipment leasing company was impaired and determined that the goodwill had no remaining value at december  accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of million in all other remaining goodwill and intangibles associated with other segments of the company not previously discussed above were reviewed at december  and  respectively  for any indications of impairment 
based on the review  no impairment was noted for the years ended december  and  related to the investment management and insurance segments 
accounting for income taxes the company accounts for income taxes by recording deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
management exercises significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities 
the judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws 
if actual results differ from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating the amount and timing of tax recognized  there can be no assurance that additional expenses will not be required in future periods 
the company s accounting policy follows the prescribed authoritative guidance that a minimal probability threshold of a tax position must be met before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
the company recognized  when applicable  interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in other non interest expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
assessment of uncertain tax positions requires careful consideration of the technical merits of a position based on management s analysis of tax regulations and interpretations 
significant judgment may be involved in applying the applicable reporting and accounting requirements 
management expects that the company s adherence to the required accounting guidance may result in increased volatility in quarterly and annual effective income tax rates because of the requirement that any change in judgment or measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period be recognized as a discrete event in the period in which it occurs 
factors that could impact management s judgment include changes in income  tax laws and regulations  and tax planning strategies 
fair value the company  in accordance with applicable accounting standards  measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are investment securities available for sale  residential mortgages held for sale and commercial loan interest rate swap agreements 
in addition  the company has elected  at its option  to measure mortgage loans held for sale at fair value 
loans with respect to which it is probable that the company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms are considered impaired loans and are measured on a nonrecurring basis 
the company conducts a review each quarter for all investment securities which reflect possible impairment to determine whether unrealized losses are temporary 
valuations for the investment portfolio are determined using quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  such valuation is based on pricing models  quotes for similar investment securities  and  where necessary  an income valuation approach based on the present value of expected cash flows 
in addition  the company considers the financial condition of the issuer  the receipt of principal and interest according to the contractual terms and the intent and ability of the company to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
the above accounting policies with respect to fair value are discussed in further detail in note fair value to the consolidated financial statements 
defined benefit pension plan the company has a qualified  noncontributory  defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees 
on november   the plan was frozen for new and existing entrants after december  all benefit accruals for employees were frozen as of december  based on past service 
thus  future salary increases and additional years of service will no longer affect the defined benefit provided by the plan although additional vesting may continue to occur 
several factors affect the net periodic benefit cost of the plan  including the size and characteristics of the plan population  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions 
pension cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plan and other factors including salary  age  years of employment  and the terms of the plan 
as a result of the plan freeze  the characteristics of the plan population should not have a materially different effect in future years 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations 
the discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the plan to a yield curve based on long term  high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date  which is december of each year 
the discount rate is adjusted each year on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on a number of factors that include expectations of market performance and the target asset allocation adopted in the plan investment policy 
should actual asset returns deviate from the projected returns  this can affect the benefit plan expense recognized in the financial statements

net interest income the largest source of the company s operating revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income for was million  representing a decrease of million or from comparing to  net interest income increased to million 
for purposes of this discussion and analysis  the interest earned on tax exempt investment securities has been adjusted to an amount comparable to interest subject to normal income taxes

the decrease in tax equivalent net interest margin in resulted from increases in non accrual loans coupled with a decrease in interest income due to declining rates on earning assets due mainly to a significant increase in lower yielding investment securities 
these lower yields were not offset entirely by declining interest rates on deposits due to prevailing market conditions

average non taxable securities declined in by compared to average total securities comprised of average earning assets in  compared to in and in this growth in investment securities in was due mainly to the growth in deposits resulting from the company s strategy to grow market share and the decline in loans due to soft loan demand  higher charge offs and strict underwriting standards at the company 
the decrease in investment securities in was due primarily to the need to fund loans as a result of the lack of substantial deposit growth during much of the year

in  interest expense decreased due to a basis point decline compared to in the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings which more than offset the increase in average interest bearing deposits 
deposit and borrowing activity during was driven primarily by extremely challenging market conditions due to the overall state of the national and regional economy 
the company dealt with an intensely competitive market for deposits by launching its operation take share deposit campaign which was intended to grow deposit market share as a result of opportunities presented by several bank acquisitions in its local markets 
the centerpiece of this campaign was the company s new premier money market deposit account which included extremely competitive rates 
most of this growth in deposits was deployed into investment securities to provide the necessary liquidity should loan demand increase in the future 
interest rate performance the net interest margin decreased by basis points in compared to  as compared to a decrease in net interest spread of basis points in compared to the difference between these two indicators of interest rate performance is attributable primarily to a significant increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits

in october  sandy spring bank  as a member of visa usa inc visa usa  received shares of restricted stock in visa  inc visa as a result of its participation in the global restructuring of visa usa  visa canada association  and visa international service association in preparation for an initial public offering 
in november  visa announced that it had reached a settlement with american express related to an antitrust lawsuit 
sandy spring bank and other visa usa member banks were obligated to share in potential losses resulting from this and certain other litigation 
in consideration of the announced american express settlement  sandy spring bank s proportionate membership share of visa usa  and accounting guidance provided by the sec  the company recorded a liability and corresponding expense in the fourth quarter of of million with respect to the american express and certain other litigation with visa usa the company has not reflected in its financial statements any value for its membership interest in visa as a result of the visa reorganization 
the anticipated ipo was completed during the first quarter of  and as a result  a portion of the company s shares in visa were redeemed for a total of million reported as a gain on securities sold 
in addition  in the first quarter of  the company reversed the liability of million mentioned above due to the fact that visa had funded an escrow account with an amount deemed sufficient to fund any potential losses resulting from the litigation at that time 
in october  visa announced that it had agreed to settle litigation with discover financial services which involved a payment from the escrow account mentioned above for approximately billion  which exceeded the amount that visa had originally funded in the escrow account for this purpose 
the class b shareholders  such as the company  bore this cost via a reduction in their number of shares received as a result of the public offering

operating expense performance management views the efficiency ratio as an important measure of expense performance and cost management 
the ratio expresses the level of non interest expenses as a percentage of total revenue net interest income plus total non interest income 
this is a gaap financial measure 
lower ratios indicate improved productivity 
non gaap financial measure the company has for many years used a traditional efficiency ratio that is a non gaap financial measure of operating expense control and efficiency of operations 
management believes that its traditional ratio better focuses attention on the operating performance of the company over time than does a gaap ratio  and is highly useful in comparing period to period operating performance of the company s core business operations 
it is used by management as part of its assessment of its performance in managing non interest expenses 
however  this measure is supplemental  and is not a substitute for an analysis of performance based on gaap measures 
the reader is cautioned that the non gaap efficiency ratio used by the company may not be comparable to gaap or non gaap efficiency ratios reported by other financial institutions 
in general  the efficiency ratio is non interest expenses as a percentage of net interest income plus non interest income 
non interest expenses used in the calculation of the non gaap efficiency ratio exclude goodwill impairment losses  the amortization of intangibles  and non recurring expenses 
income for the non gaap ratio includes the favorable effect of tax exempt income see table  and excludes securities gains and losses  which vary widely from period to period without appreciably affecting operating expenses  and non recurring gains 
the measure is different from the gaap efficiency ratio  which also is presented in this report 
the gaap measure is calculated using non interest expense and income amounts as shown on the face of the consolidated statements of income 
the gaap and non gaap efficiency ratios are reconciled in table as shown in table  both efficiency ratios increased in this increase was mainly the result of higher non interest expenses in compared to coupled with the decrease in net interest income in table gaap and non gaap efficiency ratios year ended december  dollars in thousands gaap efficiency ratio non interest expenses net interest income plus non interest income efficiency ratio gaap non gaap efficiency ratio non interest expenses less non gaap adjustment amortization of intangible assets goodwill impairment loss plus non gaap adjustment pension prior service credit non interest expenses as adjusted net interest income plus non interest income plus non gaap adjustment tax equivalent income less non gaap adjustments securities gains losses net interest income plus non interest income as adjusted efficiency ratio non gaap income taxes the company had an income tax benefit of million in  compared with an income tax expense of million in and million in the resulting effective tax rates were for  for  and for the change in the effective tax rate for compared to was due to the loss incurred in  primarily related to the provision for loan and lease losses  coupled with tax advantaged income from investment securities and bank owned life insurance policies

permanent residential mortgages  most of which are family  remained virtually even with the prior year at million 
commercial loans and leases decreased by million or  to billion at december  this decrease was due primarily to loan charge offs during the year  weak loan demand resulting from weak market conditions in the regional and national economies and the application of strict underwriting standards by the company 
included in this category are commercial real estate loans  commercial construction loans  equipment leases and other commercial loans 
the company s commercial real estate loans consist of owner occupied properties where an established banking relationship exists or  to a lesser extent  involve investment properties for warehouse  retail  and office space with a history of occupancy and cash flow 
commercial mortgages rose million or during  to million at year end 
commercial construction loans decreased million or during the year  to million at december  the unprecedented economic conditions had a significant effect on builders and developers over the past year which mainly affected the company s acquisition  development and construction loan portfolio 
in response  the company adopted more conservative underwriting guidelines  which together with soft demand and increased loan charge offs caused the decline in commercial construction loans 
other commercial loans decreased million or during to million at year end 
this decrease was also due primarily the lower level of loan demand and more conservative underwriting 
the company s equipment leasing business provides leases for essential commercial equipment used by small to medium sized businesses 
equipment leasing is conducted through vendor relations and direct solicitation to end users located primarily in states along the east coast from new jersey to florida 
the typical lease is small ticket by industry standards  averaging less than thousand  with individual leases generally not exceeding thousand 
the leasing portfolio decreased million or in  to million at year end due in large part to market conditions and their effect on small and medium sized businesses 
consumer lending continues to be important to the company s full service  community banking business 
this category of loans includes primarily home equity loans and lines of credit 
the consumer loan portfolio decreased or million  to million at december  this decline was driven largely by a decrease of million or in installment loans during to million at year end

table which follows shows that most of the above mentioned funds were invested in us agency securities  us agency mortgage backed securities and us agency collateralized mortgage obligations 
this investment strategy has resulted in a portfolio with minimal risk and relatively short durations and thus will provide needed liquidity should loan demand increase in the coming year 
the portfolio is monitored on a continuing basis with consideration given to interest rate trends and the structure of the yield curve and with constant due diligence of economic projections and analysis 
at december  the company owned a total of million in securities backed by single issuer trust preferred securities issued by banks 
the fair value of million of such securities was determined from available market quotations 
the company also owns collateralized debt securities  which total million  with a fair value of million  which are backed by pooled trust preferred securities issued by banks  thrifts  and insurance companies 
these particular securities have exhibited limited activity due to the status of the economy at december  and  respectively 
there are currently very few market participants who are willing and or able to transact for these securities 
given current conditions in the debt markets and the absence of observable transactions in the secondary markets  the company has determined the few observable transactions and market quotations that are available are not reliable for purposes of determining fair value at december  and an income valuation approach technique present value technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs will be more representative of fair value than a market approach valuation technique 
the pooled trust preferred securities will be classified within level of the fair value hierarchy because the company has determined that significant adjustments are required to determine fair value at the measurement date 
the assumptions used by the company in order to determine fair value on a present value basis  in the absence of observable trading prices as noted  included the following detailed credit and structural evaluation for each piece of collateral in the cdo 
collateral performance projections for each piece of collateral in the cdo default  recovery and prepayment amortization probabilities 
of the approximately issuers  collateral with respect to one has defaulted and two have deferred payments 
based on the view that it was unlikely that financing would become available in the foreseeable future  no collateral prepays were assumed over the lives of the investments

as part of its formal quarterly evaluation of investment securities for the presence of other than temporary impairment otti  the company considered a number of factors including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost adverse conditions specifically related to the security  industry  or geographic area historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security credit risk concentrations the ability of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments amount of principal to be recovered by stated maturity ratings changes of the security performance of bond collateral recoveries of additional declines in fair value subsequent to the date of the statement of condition the securities are senior notes with first priority other information currently available  such as the latest trustee reports an analysis of the credit worthiness of the individual pooled banks 
as a result of this evaluation  which takes into account that all payments have been received on a timely basis  and that the company has the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity  the company determined that the credit quality of these securities remains adequate to absorb further economic declines and that no otti existed with respect to these securities at december  table analysis of securities the composition of securities at december for the periods indicated

dividends paid on the senior shares are cumulative 
the warrant was issued with an initial exercise price of 
the warrant has a ten year term and is exercisable immediately  in whole or in part 
the treasury department has agreed not to vote any common shares acquired upon exercise of the warrant 
in conjunction with the issuance of the senior preferred shares and the warrant  the warrant was allocated a portion of the million issuance proceeds as required by current accounting standards 
the allocation of this value was based on the relative fair value of the senior preferred shares and the warrant to the combined fair value 
accordingly  the allocated value of the warrant was determined to be million  which was allocated from the proceeds and recorded in additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheet 
this non cash amount is considered a discount to the preferred stock and will be amortized over a five year period using the interest method and accreted as a dividend recorded on the senior preferred shares 
the warrant is included in the diluted average common shares outstanding 
the fair value of the preferred stock was determined using the net present value of cash flows projected over seven years and discounted at a rate 
the rate selected was estimated to be the rate that the company would have to pay had the company issued its own preferred stock 
this rate was comparable to the rates selected by our peer banks 
the seven year cash flow was selected for the preferred stock since it is the company s intention to redeem the preferred stock prior to the ten year maturity and minimize the impact of dividend rate 
under the terms of the transaction documents  the preferred stock may be redeemed but the warrant could still be outstanding 
the fair value of the warrant was determined using the binomial pricing model and incorporated the following assumptions contractual term years expected life years exercise price fair value of company stock risk free rate over the expected life expected volatility expected dividend yield the fair value amounts of the preferred stock and the warrant were used to allocate million proceeds received between preferred stock and additional paid in capital using the relative fair value approach as discussed in the previous paragraphs

the company s loan and lease portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk entails both general risks  which are inherent in the process of lending  and risk specific to individual borrowers 
the company s credit risk is mitigated through portfolio diversification  which limits exposure to any single customer  industry or collateral type 
typically  each consumer and residential lending product has a generally predictable level of credit losses based on historical loss experience 
home mortgage and home equity loans and lines generally have the lowest credit loss experience 
loans secured by personal property  such as auto loans generally experience medium credit losses 
unsecured loan products such as personal revolving credit have the highest credit loss experience  therefore  the bank has chosen not to engage in a significant amount of this type of lending 
credit risk in commercial lending can vary significantly  as losses as a percentage of outstanding loans can shift widely during economic cycles and are particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions 
generally  improving economic conditions result in improved operating results on the part of commercial customers  enhancing their ability to meet their particular debt service requirements 
improvements  if any  in operating cash flows can be offset by the impact of rising interest rates that may occur during improved economic times 
declining economic conditions have an adverse affect on the operating results of commercial customers  reducing their ability to meet debt service obligations 
recent economic conditions have had a broad based impact on the company s loan portfolio as a whole 
while current economic data has shown the mid atlantic region is outperforming most other markets in the nation  the company s lending portfolio is dealing with the impact from the economic pressures that are being experienced by it s borrowers  especially in the construction lending portfolios 
as unemployment has risen and collateral values have declined  the construction segments of the loan portfolio have seen a significant rise in non performing loans as builders experience declining home sales 
while the diversification of the lending portfolio among different commercial  residential and consumer product lines along with different market conditions of the baltimore metropolitan area  the dc suburbs and northern virginia have mitigated some of the risks in the portfolio  weakened local economic conditions and non performing loan levels will continue to be influenced by uncertain future conditions 
to control and manage credit risk  management has a credit process in place to ensure credit standards are maintained along with a robust in house administration accompanied by strong oversight procedures 
the primary purpose of loan underwriting is the evaluation of specific lending risks that involves the analysis of the borrower s ability to service the debt as well as the assessment of the value of the underlying collateral 
oversight procedures include the monitoring of the portfolio credit quality  early identification of potential problem credits and the aggressive management of the problem credits 
as part of the oversight process the company maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance to absorb estimated losses in the loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is based on consistent  continuous review and evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio  along with ongoing  monthly assessments of the probable losses in that portfolio 
the allowance represents an estimation of the losses that may be sustained in the loan and lease portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance is determined through careful and ongoing evaluation of the credit portfolio  and involves consideration of a number of factors  as outlined below  to establish a prudent level 
determination of the allowance is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates  including estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans and leases based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends  which may be susceptible to significant change 
loans and leases deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance  while recoveries are credited to the allowance 
management adjusts the level of the allowance through the provision for loan and lease losses  which is recorded as a current period operating expense 
the methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance includes the general formula allowance reflecting historical losses  as adjusted  by credit category  and the specific allowance for risk rated credits on an individual or portfolio basis 
this systematic allowance methodology is further described in the section entitled critical accounting policies and in note significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the amount of the allowance is reviewed and approved quarterly by the credit risk committee of the board of directors 
the general allowance establishes allowances for the major loan and lease categories based upon adjusted historical loss experience over the prior eight quarters  weighted so that losses in the most recent quarters have the greatest effect 
the factors used to adjust the historical loss experience address various risk characteristics of the company s loan and lease portfolio including trends in delinquencies and other non performing loans  changes in the risk profile related to large loans in the portfolio  changes in the categories of loans comprising the loan portfolio  concentrations of loans in specific industry segments  changes in economic conditions on both a local and national level  changes in the company s credit administration and loan and lease portfolio management processes  and quality of the company s credit risk identification processes 
general allowances are also established by application of credit risk factors to other internally risk rated loans  individual consumer and residential loans and commercial leases having reached nonaccrual or day past due status 
each risk rating category is assigned a credit risk factor based on management s estimate of the associated risk  complexity  and size of the individual loans within the category 
additional allowances may also be established in special circumstances involving a particular group of credits or portfolio within a risk category when management becomes aware that losses incurred may exceed those determined by application of the risk factor alone 
the specific allowance is used to calculate an allowance for internally risk rated loans where significant conditions or circumstances indicate that a loss may be imminent 
analysis resulting in specific allowances  including those on loans identified for evaluation of impairment  includes consideration of the borrower s overall financial condition  resources and payment record  support available from financial guarantors and the sufficiency of collateral 
these factors are combined to estimate the probability and severity of inherent losses 
then a specific allowance is established based on the company s calculation of the potential loss imbedded in the individual loan 
loans with specific allowances do not receive an additional allocation of the general reserve 
the company makes provisions for loan and lease losses in amounts necessary to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level  as established by use of the allowance methodology 
provisions amounted to million in  million in and million in net charge offs of million  million and million  were recorded in  and  respectively 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases was in  in and in at december   the allowance for loan and lease losses was million  or of total loans and leases  compared to million  or of total loans and leases  at december  management believes that the allowance is adequate 
however  its determination requires significant judgment  and estimates of probable losses in the loan and lease portfolio can vary significantly from the amounts actually observed 
while management uses available information to recognize probable losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in the credits comprising the portfolio and changes in the financial condition of borrowers  such as may result from changes in economic conditions 
in addition  federal and state regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  and independent consultants engaged by the bank  periodically review the loan and lease portfolio and the allowance 
such reviews may result in adjustments to the provision based upon their analysis of the information available at the time of each examination 
table presents a five year history for the allocation of the allowance along with the credit mix year end loan and lease allowance balances by category as a percent of total loans and leases 
the allowance is allocated in the following table to various loan and lease categories based on the methodology used to estimate loan losses  however  the allocation does not restrict the usage of the allowance for any specific loan or lease category

variations can occur over time in the methodology s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance as a result of the credit performance of borrowers 
there was no unallocated allowance at year end or  when measured against the total allowance 
the severe decline in the national and regional economies continues to exert extraordinary pressures on the housing market 
as a result  many residential real estate developers could not survive the diminished cash flows due to lack of sales and thus were unable to service their bank debt 
accordingly  this has resulted in an increase in delinquencies  non performing loans and charge offs particularly in the acquisition development and construction portfolio 
as a result of internal risk rating downgrades  charge offs and additional specific reserves primarily related to loans in the residential real estate development portfolio the provision for loan and lease losses and the allowance has increased significantly for as compared to the allowance increased by million or during the required allowance for commercial real estate and other commercial loans and leases increased by million and is reflective of the increase in non performing loans in the commercial portfolio 
the required allowance for consumer and residential loans increased million during the year  mainly due to an increase in non performing residential mortgage loans 
management continues to monitor the status of the portfolio with particular attention directed to loans with apparent credit issues in the development of the allowance and evaluating its adequacy 
at december   total non performing loans and leases were million  or of total loans and leases  compared to million  or of total loans and leases  at december  the increase in non performing loans and leases was due primarily to twenty four residential real estate development loans totaling million which became non performing during this increase was somewhat offset by million in pay downs and charge offs on previously existing real estate development loans 
the allowance represented of non performing loans and leases at december  and at this decline in the coverage ratio is the direct result of the growth in non performing loans 
a corresponding growth in the allowance was not necessary due to the validations of the underlying collateral values on the non performing loans 
in addition  analysis of the actual loss history on the problem credits in provided an indication that the coverage of the inherent losses on the problem credits was adequate 
the balance of impaired loans was million at december   with reserves of million against those loans  compared to million at december   with reserves of million 
the decline in specific reserves compared to balances of impaired loans is primarily the result of charge offs of specific loan balances down to the appraised collateral values during the million indicates the remaining collateral shortfall anticipated  based on the current status of the borrowers  of the million in impaired loans 
the company s borrowers are concentrated in six counties in maryland and two counties in virginia 
commercial and residential mortgages  including home equity loans and lines  represented of total loans and leases at december   compared to at december  certain loan terms may create concentrations of credit risk and increase the lender s exposure to loss 
these include terms that permit the deferral of principal payments or payments that are smaller than normal interest accruals negative amortization  loans with high loan to value ratios  loans  such as option adjustable rate mortgages  that may expose the borrower to future increases in repayments that are in excess of increases that would result solely from increases in market interest rates  and interest only loans 
the company does not make loans that provide for negative amortization 
the company originates option adjustable rate mortgages infrequently and sells all of them in the secondary market

market risk management the company s net income is largely dependent on its net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the extent that interest bearing liabilities mature or re price on a different basis than interest earning assets 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or re price more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income 
similarly  when interest earning assets mature or re price more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income 
net interest income is also affected by changes in the portion of interest earning assets that are funded by interest bearing liabilities rather than by other sources of funds  such as noninterest bearing deposits and stockholders equity 
the company s interest rate risk management goals are to increase net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets  and to minimize fluctuations in net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets 
management attempts to achieve these goals by balancing  within policy limits  the volume of floating rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating rate assets  by keeping the average maturity of fixed rate asset and liability contracts reasonably matched  by maintaining a pool of administered core deposits  and by adjusting pricing rates to market conditions on a continuing basis 
the company s board of directors has established a comprehensive interest rate risk management policy  which is administered by management s alco 
the policy establishes limits on risk  which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in net interest income a measure of net interest income at risk and the fair value of equity capital a measure of economic value of equity or eve at risk resulting from a hypothetical change in us treasury interest rates for maturities from one day to thirty years 
the company measures the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on its short term earnings  long term value  and liquidity by employing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling 
the simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors imbedded in investment and loan portfolio contracts 
as with any method of gauging interest rate risk  there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology used by the company 
when interest rates change  actual movements in different categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  loan prepayments  and withdrawals of time and other deposits  may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model 
finally  the methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable rate loan customers ability to service their debts  or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan  lease  and deposit products 
the company prepares a current base case and eight alternative simulations at least once a quarter  and reports the analysis to the board of directors 
in addition  more frequent forecasts are produced when interest rates are particularly uncertain or when other business conditions so dictate 
the statement of condition is subject to quarterly testing for eight alternative interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk 
average interest rates are shocked by    and basis points bp  although the company may elect not to use particular scenarios that it determines are impractical in a current rate environment 
it is management s goal to structure the balance sheet so that net interest earnings at risk over a twelve month period and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels 
the company augments its quarterly interest rate shock analysis with alternative external interest rate scenarios on a monthly basis 
these alternative interest rate scenarios may include non parallel rate ramps and non parallel yield curve twists 
if a measure of risk produced by the alternative simulations of the entire balance sheet violates policy guidelines  alco is required to develop a plan to restore the measure of risk to a level that complies with policy limits within two quarters 
measures of net interest income at risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution s short term performance in alternative rate environments 
these measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period  usually one year 
they do not necessarily indicate the long term prospects or economic value of the institution 
table estimated changes in net interest income change in interest rates bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp policy limit december  n a n a n a n a december  n a n a n a n a as shown above  measures of net interest income at risk increased from december  at all interest rate shock levels 
all measures remained well within prescribed policy limits 
the risk position increased substantially in the rising rate scenarios due to a lengthening of durations in the securities portfolio resulting from growth in cmo s  a decrease in variable rate loans  and an increase in money market deposit accounts due to the growth in the newly introduced money market product 
also  the subordinated debt  which previously carried a fixed rate  converted to a much lower floating rate in and now re prices to the higher shock rates therefore adding to the overall net interest income risk 
the measures of equity value at risk indicate the ongoing economic value of the company by considering the effects of changes in interest rates on all of the company s cash flows  and by discounting the cash flows to estimate the present value of assets and liabilities 
the difference between these discounted values of the assets and liabilities is the economic value of equity  which  in theory  approximates the fair value of the company s net assets 
table estimated changes in economic value of equity eve change in interest rates bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp policy limit december  n a n a n a n a december  n a n a n a n a measures of the economic value of equity eve at risk increased over year end in all interest rate shock levels 
the economic value of equity exposure at bp is now compared to at year end  and is well within the policy limit of  as are measures at all other shock levels 
during  the securities portfolio has realized a negative impact compared to due to the significant growth in the portfolio and the lengthening of the duration of the portfolio due to rising interest rates 
the increase in the balance of the newly introduced money market product is causing a negative impact to eve in the rising shock bands as those funds provide no additional premium as the interest rates move upward because of the assumption that the rate will re price to market as rates increase 
liquidity management liquidity is measured by a financial institution s ability to raise funds through loan and lease repayments  maturing investments  deposit growth  borrowed funds  capital and the sale of highly marketable assets such as investment securities and residential mortgage loans 
the company s liquidity position  considering both internal and external sources available  exceeded anticipated short term and long term needs at december  management considers core deposits  defined to include all deposits other than time deposits of thousand or more  to be a relatively stable funding source 
core deposits equaled of total earning assets at december  in addition  loan and lease payments  maturities  calls and pay downs of securities  deposit growth and earnings contribute a flow of funds available to meet liquidity requirements 
in assessing liquidity  management considers operating requirements  the seasonality of deposit flows  investment  loan and deposit maturities and calls  expected funding of loans and deposit withdrawals  and the market values of available for sale investments  so that sufficient funds are available on short notice to meet obligations as they arise and to ensure that the company is able to pursue new business opportunities 
liquidity is measured using an approach designed to take into account  in addition to factors already discussed above  the company s growth and mortgage banking activities 
also considered are changes in the liquidity of the investment portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 
under this approach  implemented by the funds management subcommittee of alco under formal policy guidelines  the company s liquidity position is measured weekly  looking forward at thirty day intervals from thirty to three hundred sixty days 
the measurement is based upon the projection of funds sold or purchased position  along with ratios and trends developed to measure dependence on purchased funds and core growth 
resulting projections as of december   show short term investments exceeding short term borrowings by million over the subsequent days 
this projected excess of liquidity versus requirements provides the company with flexibility in how it funds loans and other earning assets 
the company also has external sources of funds  which can be drawn upon when required 
the main sources of external liquidity are available lines of credit with the federal home loan bank of atlanta and the federal reserve 
the line of credit with the federal home loan bank of atlanta totaled billion  of which million was available for borrowing based on pledged collateral  with million borrowed against it as of december  the line of credit at the federal reserve totaled million  all of which was available for borrowing based on pledged collateral  with no borrowings against it as of december  other external sources of liquidity available to the company in the form of unsecured lines of credit granted by correspondent banks totaled million at december   against which there were no outstanding borrowings 
in addition  the company had a secured line of credit with a correspondent bank of million as of december  based upon its liquidity analysis  including external sources of liquidity available  management believes the liquidity position was appropriate at december  the parent company bancorp is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
in addition to its operating expenses  bancorp is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its common shareholders  dividends on its preferred stock  and interest and principal on outstanding debt 
bancorp s primary source of income is dividends received from the bank 
the amount of dividends that the bank may declare and pay to bancorp in any calendar year  without the receipt of prior approval from the federal reserve  cannot exceed net income for that year to date plus retained net income as defined for the preceding two calendar years 
at december   bancorp had liquid assets of million
