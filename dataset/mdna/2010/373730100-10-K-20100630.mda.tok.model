overview and outlook gerber develops  manufactures  distributes and services integrated automation equipment and software  as well as related aftermarket supplies and spare parts for the sign making and specialty graphics industry  the apparel and flexible materials and composites industries and the ophthalmic lens processing industry through its global operations 
gerber s revenue is derived from the following operating segments  with business unit names displayed parenthetically for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands sign making and specialty graphics gerber scientific products  gerber innovations and spandex apparel and industrial gerber technology ophthalmic lens processing gerber coburn consolidated revenue the adverse economic environment that began mid fiscal and persisted into fiscal resulted in lower equipment  aftermarket and service volume at gerber in both fiscal and based upon market data  gerber does not believe that it has lost market share in the key markets that it serves and does not believe that the revenue decline since fiscal represents an operating trend 
gerber s customers invest in capital equipment  and global capital equipment markets have been depressed in recent periods by negative macroeconomic conditions 
during the last quarter of fiscal  revenue levels  orders and backlog increased as compared with the prior year  particularly within the apparel and industrial segment 
this increase is believed to be an indicator of the beginning of improved conditions in the markets in which the gerber operating segments conduct business 
despite the weak economy  gerber s overall sales strategy remains focused on new product development and geographic market expansion 
gerber s product development process focuses on platform development that enables the company to leverage its product innovations with product extensions and add ons 
gerber s long term growth strategy includes geographic expansion in asian markets  particularly in china  and the addition of markets throughout south america 
gerber pursues a number of initiatives intended to improve its operating efficiency and gross profit margins 
the strategies for improving gross margins include targeting the lowering of overhead costs  simplifying product cost structures through engineering design improvements  and expanding into new markets to improve factory absorp tion 
gerber believes that the foregoing strategies will position gerber for resumption in growth as markets begin to recover 
cost control measures were implemented in fiscal and continued into fiscal to sustain profitability and mitigate the adverse impact of lower revenue volumes 
such measures included a global workforce reduction of approximately percent that was initiated in fiscal in recognition of global economic challenges and expected revenue volume declines  as well as a freeze of united states defined benefit pension plans as of april  benefits from the fiscal workforce reductions have been consistent with gerber s previously reported expectations for full year benefits 
gerber expects that savings from these initiatives should continue to benefit future periods when sales volume improves 
certain temporary actions were also taken in fiscal and fiscal in res ponse to lower revenue volume that included a percent salary reduction in the united states  a discontinuation of employer matching contributions to the us k retirement plan  unpaid work furloughs and a four day work week at certain facilities  as well as several discretionary cost control measures 
the percent salary reduction was decreased to percent in late fiscal gerber expects to continue to focus on closely managing its expenses in fiscal and subsequent fiscal periods 
cost control measures were partially offset by restructuring and other expenses of million in fiscal and million in fiscal restructuring and other expenses included severance expenses associated with the workforce reductions 
gerber continued to invest in its business in fiscal through focused research and development projects and business strategy planning 
the following table presents the components of operating income as a percentage of consolidated revenue 
for the fiscal years ended april  gross profit margin selling  general and administrative sg a expenses research and development restructuring and other expenses operating income as compared with fiscal  net income and earnings per share in fiscal were favorably impacted by a tax benefit of million from the merger of two french subsidiaries and a pre tax gain of million from the sale of a gerber coburn australian facility  and were adversely impacted by million of pre tax impairment charges related to an investment deemed other than temporarily impaired 
as compared with fiscal and fiscal  net income and earnings per share in fiscal included the benefit of non recurring pre tax gains of million related to the sale of a land parcel and the sale of the ophthalmic lens processing segment s innovations software 
as part of gerber s business strategy  management continually reviews and evaluates the risk and opportunities with its existing business segments 
as a result of these reviews  gerber may acquire bolt on businesses to supplement growth and product development or divest businesses that no longer fit its core long term growth strategy due to less attractive industry fundamentals or reduced long term returns 
during fiscal  gerber completed an acquisition of yunique solutions  inc  or yunique  a software development company serving apparel and flexible materials industries with annual unaudited historical revenue of approximately million 
this acquisition is expected to enhance gerber s existing product lifecycle management and product data management software offerings 
in fiscal  gerber acquired virtek vision international  inc  or virtek  a manufacturer of precision laser based templating and inspection solutions 
in fiscal  gerber also acquired gamma computer tech co  ltd  or gamma  in china to expand gerber s manufacturing operations in china 
together  these three acquisitions generated revenue of million in fiscal virtek and gamma together generated revenue of million in fiscal during fiscal  gerber also completed four non core asset sales 
gerber sold its laser marking and engraving business unit  foba technology services gmbh  or foba  in september foba was previously reported within the apparel and industrial segment 
also in september  gerber sold nd graphics  a canadian business unit of gerber scientific products 
gerber closed the majority of its spandex poland operations during october in april  certain assets of spandex new zealand and gerber coburn australia were sold 
subsequent to these asset sales  the divisions were substantially closed 
the results of these five businesses are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this annual report on form k 
with proceeds from non core asset sales and operating income  gerber repaid million of its debt during the fiscal year ended april  gerber was in compliance with its credit facility financial covenants as of april  the difficult market environments that adversely impacted fiscal and fiscal results appear to be recovering based upon increased order and quote activity across most of gerber s business lines as evidenced by product demand during the fourth quarter of fiscal gerber plans to continue to execute its strategy to streamline its global operations and permanently reduce its cost structure in fiscal in june  gerber announced a consolidation of its massachusetts production facility into its connecticut production facilities 
while this facility consolidation plan is anticipated to result in restructuring and other expenses of approximately million in fiscal  future annual rent and other building costs should decrease with expected annual savings of approximately million 
as gerber continues to analyze other strategies to streamline business processes and lower overhead costs  gerber may incur severance and other expenses in fiscal results of operations for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands revenue cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development restructuring and other expenses operating income gerber generates a substantial portion of its revenue from sales to non us markets 
gerber therefore analyzes its results of operations on a constant currency basis  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation 
the impact of foreign currency translation on the operating performance quantified within this management s discussion and analysis was estimated by comparing translated amounts at the fiscal average foreign exchange rates with the historical comparison period average foreign exchange rates 
revenue in fiscal  consolidated revenue decreased million  or percent  from fiscal fiscal revenue decreased million  or percent  from fiscal foreign currency translation favorably impacted fiscal revenue by approximately million as a result of the united states dollar weakening against several other currencies in which gerber transacts business as compared with fiscal foreign currency translation negatively impacted fiscal revenue by approximately million as a result of the united states dollar strengthening against several other currencies in which gerber transacts business as compared with fiscal lower sales volume negatively impacted revenue by approximately million in fiscal as compared with fiscal and negatively impacted revenue by approximately million in fiscal as compared with fiscal the lower sales volume in both periods was primarily attributable to adverse economic conditions impacting each region in which gerber sells its products 
partially offsetting lower sales volume in both periods  incremental revenue from recent acquisitions was million in fiscal and million in fiscal pricing benefited revenue million in fiscal and million in fiscal as compared with the respective prior year periods 
the following table provides revenue by source for the fiscal years ended april   and for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands equipment and software revenue aftermarket supplies revenue service revenue revenue adverse economic conditions softened demand and restricted availability of credit  making it difficult for certain customers to obtain financing for potential equipment purchases 
aftermarket supplies and service revenues both provide a source of repeat business revenue after the initial equipment sale 
as a result  the percentage declines for aftermarket supplies and service revenues from the prior fiscal years were not as significant as the percentage declines in equipment sales revenue 
despite the weakened global economic environment  gerber continued to focus on new equipment and software product development 
in fiscal  gerber launched the ophthalmic lens processing segment eco friendly eg blocking system for the wholesale market 
in fiscal  gerber launched the solara ion  a wide format ultraviolet inkjet printer for the sign making and specialty graphics segment and the z gerbercutter  a high performance multi ply cutting system within the apparel and industrial segment 
in fiscal  gerber launched fashion lifecycle management within the apparel and industrial segment for product lifecycle management and the dtl generator and maat polisher  which together form the basis for the advanced lens processing system with free form capability within the ophthalmic lens processing segment 
revenue from all key new products was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal gerber believes that revenue from key new product launches in fiscal and were depressed as a result of the weak global economy and adverse credit market conditions that reduced credit availability for potential customers 
gerber believes that it is well positioned to capitalize on demand for these products when the economies in its various markets recover 
aftermarket supplies revenue decreased percent from fiscal to fiscal and percent from fiscal to fiscal the decreases were primarily attributable to lower sales volume at gerber s end user customer locations within the sign making and specialty graphics segment and  in fiscal  unfavorable foreign currency translation compared with the prior year period 
typically  aftermarket supplies sales of replacement parts and consumables remain relatively stable due to the large base of installed equipment in use  even during periods of economic volatility 
service revenue decreased percent from fiscal to fiscal and percent from fiscal to fiscal the equipment installed base and related service contracts from prior fiscal years partially mitigated the full impact of adverse economic conditions on fiscal and service revenue 
service revenue  like revenue from sales of aftermarket supplies  typically remains relatively stable due to the installed equipment base 
as an international company  gerber s operating results are affected by global and industrial factors 
global geographic sales expansion and industry diversification  both of which are key gerber operating strategies  help to limit the adverse impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on gerber s consolidated revenue and operating results 
in fiscal  gerber expects to continue to focus both on its domestic and international operations by promoting new product launches worldwide and conducting business in targeted markets  particularly in the rest of world region 
revenue by geographic region and as a percentage of consolidated revenue in fiscal  and was as follows for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands north america europe rest of world revenue north america markets showed improvement in fiscal and then experienced deterioration in fiscal the improvement in fiscal reflected the contribution of incremental revenue from the virtek acquisition  which was more than offset in fiscal by continued weak demand from north america sign making and specialty graphics distributors and ophthalmic markets 
the reduced ophthalmic market demand reflected  in addition to weakened global economic conditions  the impact of continued industry consolidation efforts affecting larger laboratories 
the fiscal and fiscal declines in revenue experienced in europe reflected lower demand as a result of global economic factors  beginning particularly in the second half of fiscal  as well as the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation in fiscal the increase in the rest of world revenue in fiscal was primarily related to growing equipment and software demand from apparel markets within asia 
the significant decline in fiscal from fiscal in these markets was also associated with the economic downturn  which was first evidenced in the rest of worl d region within the apparel and industrial segment 
gerber reported revenue from sales to greater china of million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
gerber believes that the china revenue declines in fiscal and as compared with fiscal were attributable to the weak global economy and are not indicative of a fundamental change in the demand for its products in the greater china market 
the following table provides backlog information as of april  and the overall increase in backlog was attributable to the apparel and industrial segment  indicating some improvements in market conditions for that segment that were experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decline in backlog for the sign making and specialty graphics segment reflected lower equipment demand 
in thousands april  april  backlog sign making and specialty graphics apparel and industrial ophthalmic lens processing gross profit gross profit and gross profit margin for the past three fiscal years is shown in the following table for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands gross profit gross profit margin fiscal gross profit decreased percent compared with fiscal directly as a result of the percent decline in revenue 
fiscal gross profit decreased percent compared with fiscal directly as a result of the percent decline in revenue 
fiscal gross profit benefited from million of favorable foreign currency translation  while fiscal gross profit was unfavorably impacted by million of foreign currency translation 
depressed revenue volumes in fiscal and fiscal resulted in unfavorable absorption of fixed manufacturing costs and resulted in lower gross profits for both years 
in fiscal and fiscal  to address the impact of lower revenue on gross profit  gerber initiated cost savings actions that included temporary salary redu ctions and work furloughs 
actions were also taken to reduce the overall workforce size in fiscal fiscal gross profit included severance costs of million related to these actions 
fiscal gross profit benefited from the incremental contribution from operations of the acquired businesses 
in fiscal  gerber will seek to improve gross profit by reducing plant overhead costs and designing existing products with a lower cost structure  and anticipates that gross profit will also be favorably affected by increased sales volume as the economy improves 
as plans to reduce overhead costs are developed  gerber may incur restructuring and other expenses for facility consolidation efforts 
gerber s gross profit margin increased percentage points in fiscal as compared with fiscal and declined percentage points in fiscal as compared with fiscal the improvement in fiscal was driven by actions to lower gerber s cost structure that resulted in lower labor expenses 
fiscal cost of sales included incremental costs associated with the virtek and gamma acquisitions of million and severance of million  which negatively impacted fiscal gross profit margin in total by percentage points 
gerber anticipates that the actions and expected economic recovery described above which are expected to improve gross profit in fiscal also will favorably impact gross profit margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands change change selling  general and administrative expenses the significant decline in sg a expenses in fiscal and fiscal as compared with fiscal was attributable to proactive implementation of cost savings measures in both years 
in fiscal  gerber s us employee base received percent of full salary through march and percent of full salary in april in addition  during fiscal  the us employee base had both two weeks of unpaid furlough and additional required vacation usage periods 
the us pension plan was frozen as of april   which resulted in lower pension expenses  and the us k plan employer matching contributions were suspended durin g fiscal in fiscal  the global workforce was reduced by percent  the us employee base received percent of full salary for approximately three months  and employer matching contributions to the us k plan ceased in january in addition  during fiscal  the us employee base had both one week of unpaid furlough and additional required vacation usage periods 
the workforce reductions and the us pension plan freeze are expected to be sustainable cost reductions when the economy recovers 
the remaining cost savings measures were temporary actions 
pension plan expenses in the united states were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal pension expenses included a million curtailment loss recognized as a result of the pension plan freeze 
fiscal results included a million noncash benefit from a favorable tax accrual adjustment 
 partially offsetting these lower costs  fiscal and fiscal sg a included incremental expenses from acquired companies of million in fiscal and million in fiscal sg a expenses in fiscal included incentive compensation expense of million and million in professional fees related to gerber s adoption of an accounting standard related to uncertain income tax provisions 
those higher costs were partially offset by a gain of million on the sale of assets within the ophthalmic lens processing segment 
gerber plans to continue to closely manage expenses in fiscal and will seek to limit increases in sg a to investments in sales and marketing efforts for strategic growth and to phase out the temporary cost cutting measures described above 
research and development for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands change change research and development r d gerber is committed to new product development and believes that such efforts are important to its prospects for profitable growth 
r d as a percentage of revenue remained steady at approximately percent in the past three fiscal years 
the lower expenses in fiscal and as compared with fiscal reflected the impact of workforce reductions  and were partially offset by incremental development costs incurred by acquired companies of million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal research and development projects are expected to be limited to strategic new products and sustaining engineering of existing pro ducts  which includes potential design changes to lower product costs 
restructuring and other expenses for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands restructuring and other expenses restructuring and other expenses consist of severance costs  acquisition costs  asset impairment charges and facility restructuring charges 
as a result of the adoption of updated business combination accounting rules on may   both acquisition and restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed 
in fiscal  restructuring and other expenses included severance costs of million that were associated with the termination of certain employees that became redundant upon the acquisition of yunique 
such costs were recorded within the apparel and industrial segment 
gerber does not anticipate any future additional restructuring costs associated with this action 
fees of million associated with the yunique acquisition were also included in fiscal restructuring and other expenses and were recorded within the corporate segment 
finance restructuring and other severance costs of million were also recorded in fiscal as a result of business process improvement initiatives that included the outsourcing of certain functions as well as overall headcount reductions 
these costs were recorded within the corporate segment 
gerber continues to evaluate its workforce based on expected future business size 
expenses associated with discontinuance of certain patents of million were also recorded as restructuring and other expenses within the corporate segment for the year ended april in fiscal  gerber reduced its global workforce and incurred severance expenses of million 
of this amount  the sign making and specialty graphics segment incurred million  the apparel and industrial segment incurred million and the ophthalmic lens processing segment incurred million 
the fiscal severance costs were paid in full by april  expenses associated with discontinuance of certain patents of million were also recorded as restructuring and other expenses within the corporate segment for the year ended april  in fiscal  gerber completed a facility rationalization plan for its connecticut locations and determined that it would reoccupy a previously vacated leased facility 
this determination resulted in the reversal of a previously established leased facility restructuring reserve and generated a million benefit 
this benefit was reflected in the sign making and specialty graphics segment  as the initial charge was recorded to this segment s performance in fiscal gerber continues to review its facility usage 
if any of gerber s leased facilities were to become vacant in future periods  gerber may incur restructuring charges to vacate leased facilities prior to the lease expiration dates and employee severance costs associated with relocating operations 
expenses associated with discontinuance of certain patents of million were recorded as restructuring and other expenses within the corporate segment for the year ended april  other income expense  net for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands other income expense  net in fiscal  and  other income expense primarily included bank fees  interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses for all periods presented 
other income expense in fiscal also included a million non cash charge related to the recording of an other than temporary impairment of an available for sale investment 
although gerber anticipates that this investment will recover its value over time  the duration of the loss and the inability to predict when the united states stock markets will recover resulted in gerber determining that this investment was other than temporarily impaired during fiscal also included in fiscal results was a million loss from a derivative transaction 
other income expense in fiscal also included a gain on the sale of a parcel of land in connecticut of million 
interest expense for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands interest expense weighted average credit facility interest rates interest expense includes interest costs incurred related to gerber s borrowings  the amortization of debt issuance costs and early debt extinguishment charges 
weighted average credit facility interest rates include the amortization of debt issuance costs and interest expenses allocated to discontinued operations  and exclude early debt extinguishment charges 
weighted average credit facility interest rates are calculated using average monthly debt 
gerber s interest rates are based on market rates plus an applicable margin 
to lock in fixed interest rates  gerber entered into two interest rate swap agreements in fiscal  each with two year terms  to fix the interest rates on million of its variable interest rate debt 
the interest rate swap for million of debt expired in may and the interest rate swap for million of debt expires in november gerber entered into its current credit facility in january and entered into amendments to the facility terms in march and november the march amendment resulted in an increase in gerber s cost of borrowing by approximately one percentage point from the january levels  while the november amendment did not change borrowing rates 
gerber incurred a million early debt extinguishment charge in connection with the november amendment and the early repayment of million in principal of outstanding variable rate demand industrial development bonds 
gerber incurred a million loss for the write off of certain deferred financing costs in connection with the march amendment 
in connection with a january credit facility refinancing  gerber incur red a million loss from the early extinguishment of debt related to the remaining capitalized deferred debt issuance costs associated with its previous credit facilities 
gerber has allocated interest expense to discontinued operations  as proceeds from the sales of foba and nd graphics were required to reduce the outstanding credit facility obligation 
gerber allocated million of interest expense to discontinued operations for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal interest expense in fiscal increased million from fiscal interest rates charged on credit facility borrowings were increased percentage point as a result of the march amendment 
the higher rates were charged for twelve full months of fiscal and only for two months of fiscal  which resulted in an increase in the weighted average credit facility interest rates in fiscal in fiscal  gerber repaid million of its outstanding debt  and the resulting lower debt levels partially offset the increased interest from higher weighted average credit facility interest rates 
interest expense in fiscal decreased million from fiscal fiscal interest expense benefited from lower interest rates pursuant to the fiscal credit facility refinancing 
fiscal interest expense was impacted for four months by the refinancing 
income tax expense benefit for the fiscal years ended april  effective tax rate gerber s fiscal effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of percent as a result of the favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit  benefits from the utilization of certain foreign net operating losses which had been previously reserved  international tax rate differences and changes in earnings mix 
during fiscal  gerber merged its two french subsidiaries in order to avoid redundant administrative costs and simplify the capital structure of the entities 
the total of net operating loss carryforwards available with respect to these subsidiaries immediately prior to the merger was million 
as a result  it is more likely than not that the tax benefits from the loss carryforwards of the merged entity will be realized  and accordingly gerber reversed a million valuation reserve against the loss carryforwards 
gerber s effective tax rate would have been percent for fiscal  excluding the non recurring tax benefit from the merger of the french subsidiaries  as compared with the statutory rate of percent 
the remaining percentage point difference from the statu tory rate of percent primarily reflected adjustments to tax contingencies and the effects of international rate differences 
reconciling differences for fiscal from the statutory rate of percent were primarily attributable from foreign tax rate differentials  as well as adjustments to tax contingency reserves 
benefits related to tax credits based on research and development costs also favorably impacted the effective tax rate in fiscal as of april   gerber had net deferred tax assets of approximately million  of which approximately million relate to the united states 
in each tax jurisdiction  deferred tax assets are assessed for realizability based on all evidence available  including historical earnings  projected earnings and tax planning strategies 
given recent losses within the united states  gerber is closely monitoring the realizability of the us deferred tax assets 
as of april   gerber expected that the recorded net deferred tax assets are fully recoverable 
if future reassessment of the realizability results in management s determination that it is more likely than not that these assets would not be realized  a valuation reserve would be recorded 
discontinued operations on september   gerber sold foba to alltec angewandte laserlicht technologie gmbh  the laser business unit of videojet technologies inc  for a net sales price of approximately million 
foba  acquired in october as part of the acquisition of virtek  was sold because it was not considered a core strategic focus for gerber 
gerber sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of nd graphics  a canadian business unit of gerber scientific products within the sign making and specialty graphics segment  to a group of investors led by the president of nd graphics on september  for a net sales price of approximately million 
gerber also closed the majority of its spandex poland operations during the fiscal quarter ended october  and its spandex new zealand and gerber coburn australia operations during the fiscal quarter ended april  the results of the spandex poland and spandex new zealand business were previously reported within the sign making and specialty graphics segment and the results of the gerber coburn australia operations were previously reported within the ophthalmic lens processing segment 
segment review sign making and specialty graphics the sign making and specialty graphics segment has emphasized the development and sale of the solara ion family of inkjet products  which utilize gerber s patent pending cold fire cure process and gerbercat cationic inks 
the cold fire cure process offers high quality material compatibility and extends the life of curing lamps used in uv printing due to lower energy output and heat generation 
gerbercat cationic ink  which offers a matched print technology engine  enables printing on a wide array of both rigid and flexible substrates with high quality adhesion  abrasion resistance and color output 
while market demand for inkjet printers is outpacing that of thermal printers  gerber maintains a leadership position in the thermal imaging products l ine and believes that there is a continuing role for thermal imaging printers due to the large base of thermal printers still in use today 
the majority of spandex s sales consist of sales of aftermarket supplies  including inks and vinyls 
these sales typically provide a steady stream of revenue  although volumes fluctuate based on external demand for signage 
for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands gsp spandex total gsp spandex total gsp spandex total revenue operating loss income fiscal segment revenue decreased million  or percent  from fiscal  which included the favorable impact on spandex s revenue of foreign currency translation of approximately million compared with fiscal fiscal segment revenue decreased million  or percent  from fiscal  which included the negative impact on spandex s revenue of foreign currency translation of approximately million compared with fiscal gerber believes that the weak global economy  which caused uncertainty and reduced end market product demand for its customers  combined with reduced credit availability to finance purchases  adversely affected demand for the segment s products and caused the majority of the remaining revenue decline in both business units for both periods 
 lower than anticipated revenue from the solara ion in fiscal was driven by overall economic conditions that have continued to create customer hesitation in committing to capital purchases  continued reduction of credit availability to finance purchases and warranty related field issues 
gerber believes it has identified the warranty related issues and is continuing to seek to resolve the issues through its product improvement program 
additionally  actions by several of gerber s distributors to reduce inventory of demonstration equipment in preparation for the upcoming release of the new solara ion high resolution system are believed to have affected demand 
fiscal equipment revenue benefited from the initial launch of the solara ion in that fiscal year 
gsp did not record any patent licensing revenue in fiscal  while it recorded million of such revenue in fiscal and million in fiscal licensing revenue is not a predictable  recurring revenue source 
aftermarket revenue declines are believed to be consistent with the sign making and specialty graphics current market conditions for the markets served by gerber and therefore are not believed to be indicative of a loss of market share 
the revenue decline in spandex s aftermarket supplies represented the majority of the business unit s decline in revenue for fiscal and fiscal from fiscal recent cost savings actions allowed this segment  driven by the spandex business unit  to remain profitable 
spandex reported improved operating income  despite lower revenue in fiscal this improvement occurred despite a million reduction in vendor rebates in fiscal as compared with fiscal as a result of lower volume purchases  and was driven by the positive impact of recent cost savings measures that included a reduced workforce 
foreign currency translation provided approximately million of the increase in fiscal as compared with fiscal fiscal included incremental bad debt expenses of million primarily related to economic conditions in europe 
gsp s operating loss in fiscal reflected unfavorable absorption of fixed manufac turing costs on a lower revenue base and also included incremental warranty costs associated with the solara ion 
gsp s operating loss was mitigated by recent cost savings actions and a million noncash benefit from a favorable tax accrual adjustment 
gerber believes that its continued focus on controllable expenses  improved volumes and lower warranty expenses will improve future profitability of this segment when the economy stabilizes 
segment operating income in fiscal was lower than in fiscal primarily as a result of lower revenue volume and approximately million of unfavorable foreign currency translation 
gsp s operating loss in fiscal was partially mitigated by a million non cash benefit attributable to management s decision to utilize a leased facility that was previously vacated 
fiscal segment operating profit included severance costs associated with the workforce reductions and higher bad debt expense associated with the economic conditions as compared with fiscal fiscal savings from the workforce reductions and lower r d spending partially mitigated the overall decline in operating profit

apparel and industrial the apparel and industrial segment is focused on growth through continued penetration of asian markets and expansion through bolt on acquisitions 
in fiscal  gerber acquired yunique  a software company located in new york 
yunique is expected to enhance gerber s existing product lifecycle management and product data management software offerings 
in fiscal  gerber acquired gamma  a china based manufacturer of equipment for apparel and flexible materials companies  and virtek  a manufacturer of precision laser based templating and inspection solutions used in composites material manufacturing 
virtek  headquartered in canada  primarily serves global customers in the prefabricated construction and transportation industries 
for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands segment revenue segment operating income fiscal segment revenue decreased million  or percent  from fiscal and included the positive impact of approximately million from foreign currency translation compared with fiscal fiscal segment revenue decreased million  or percent  from fiscal and reflected the negative impact of approximately million from foreign currency translation compared with fiscal gerber believes that the decline in revenue in both periods was primarily attributable to the weak global economy  which created uncertainty and reduced end market product demand for gerber technology s customers  and reduced credit availability to finance purchases 
gerber believes this decline in revenue does not represent a loss of market share for the company  but rather reflects the ad verse impacts of the economy on demand for gerber technology s products among the business unit s customers 
partially offsetting these macroeconomic impacts  fiscal revenue included incremental revenue of million from the acquisitions of yunique  virtek and gamma and fiscal revenue included incremental revenue of million from the acquisitions of virtek and gamma 
revenue is expected to improve in fiscal  with indications of economic improvements in the second half of fiscal including increased orders within asian apparel markets 
within greater china  a key growth market  revenue was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal gerber believes that the revenue improvement in fiscal indicates that the economy in asia is beginning to recover from the downturn in fiscal key new products revenue of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and mil lion in fiscal reflected the introduction of several new equipment products over the last three fiscal years  including the z gerbercutter  a high performance multi ply cutting system launched in fiscal gerber believes the new product launches were negatively impacted by global economic factors 
fiscal segment operating income increased million from fiscal  despite lower revenue 
the increase in fiscal primarily reflected the positive impact of permanent and temporary cost reduction strategies and a full year of profit contribution from the recently acquired virtek business 
segment operating income in both fiscal and fiscal was negatively impacted by lower software and equipment gross profit contribution and unfavorable absorption of fixed manufacturing costs as a result of the lower factory volume 
workforce reduction actions  an absence of incentive compensation costs  discretionary spending controls and lower sales and marketing expenses mitigated the full impact of lower revenue on operating income for both fiscal and fiscal fiscal results included severance costs of million related to the termination of employees that became redundant with the yunique acquisition 
fiscal results included severance costs of million related to the fiscal workforce reductions  which were implemented beginning in august  with the result that the annual cost savings of the reduced workforce were not ful ly realized until fiscal ophthalmic lens processing the production of free form lenses represents a growing trend within the ophthalmic industry 
free form lens processing allows the production of a progressive no line  multi focal lens surface through machining rather than casting or molding processes  and enables the lens laboratory to provide other value added characteristics to the lens 
in late fiscal  gerber launched new products incorporating free form capability  which are particularly attractive to larger laboratories 
these products include the dtl generator and the maat polisher  which together form the basis for the advanced lens processing system  or alps  with free form capability 
the ophthalmic markets are continuing to undergo industry consolidations  with la rger laboratories purchasing smaller independent laboratories  and large retail chains acquiring smaller chains and independent retailers  resulting in a smaller independent laboratory and retailer customer base 
late in fiscal  gerber launched the eco friendly eg blocking system  or eg  for sale primarily to the larger laboratories 
the ophthalmic lens processing segment also distributes equipment in certain markets that is produced by a third party distributor 
the most recently launched distributed product is marketed as mr 
blue  a finishing system that includes an edger and a tracer for ophthalmic markets 
for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands segment revenue segment operating income fiscal segment revenue decreased million  or percent  from fiscal and reflected the positive impact of approximately million from foreign currency translations compared with fiscal fiscal segment revenue decreased million  or percent  from fiscal and reflected the negative impact of approximately million from foreign currency translations compared with fiscal the ophthalmic markets have been impacted by the weak global economy and reduced credit availability to finance purchases  as well as the industry consolidations referred to above 
these factors have significantly affected equipment and aftermarket supplies revenue  resulting in lower fiscal revenue compared with historical periods 
key new product revenue was milli on in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal and included sales of the recently launched eg and alps systems 
gerber believes that the new product launches were negatively impacted by economic conditions 
market studies indicate that purchases of eyeglasses were depressed in fiscal  which adversely impacted demand for ophthalmic aftermarket supplies and lens production and finishing capital equipment 
gerber coburn recorded patent licensing revenue in fiscal of million and did not record any such revenue in fiscal or fiscal licensing revenue is not a predictable  recurring revenue source 
despite lower revenue  this segment has maintained profitability by significantly lowering its cost structure through workforce reductions and lean manufacturing initiatives 
segment operating profit decreased million  or percent  in fiscal from fiscal and decreased million  or percent  in fiscal from fiscal the decreases reflected the impact of lower gross profits and higher bad debt expenses related to macroeconomic factors 
the decline was significantly mitigated by cost savings from workforce reductions and lower r d expenses 
partially offsetting these benefits in fiscal were r d expenses related to the investment of development costs for the alps system

corporate operating expenses in fiscal decreased million from fiscal primarily as a result of lower salary expenses from the workforce reductions  temporary cost savings measures and lower pension expenses 
higher severance  strategic  and stock based compensation costs partially mitigated the lower costs in fiscal as compared with fiscal corporate severance costs were million in fiscal  representing an increase of million over fiscal strategic expenses included acquisition fees for the yunique acquisition of million

corporate operating expenses in fiscal decreased million from fiscal the decrease primarily resulted from the non recurrence of expenses incurred in fiscal that included severance costs of million and incentive compensation expense of million 
fiscal expenses also included accounting professional fees of million associated with gerber s adoption of an accounting standard related to uncertain income tax provisions and other incremental accounting professional fees of million 
partially offsetting these items  in fiscal self insurance costs increased million and defined pension benefit costs increased million 
fiscal pension expenses included a million curtailment loss that was associated with the pension plan benefits freez e implemented as of april  financial condition liquidity and capital resources gerber s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the company s senior secured revolving credit facility 
these sources of liquidity are subject to all of the risks of gerber s business  including those described in item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k 
these sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by  among other factors  a decrease in demand for gerber s products  charges that may be required because of changes in market conditions or other costs of doing business  delayed product introductions or adverse changes to availability of funds 
adverse conditions in the credit and financial markets have reduced liquidity and credit availability and increased volatility in prices of securities across most ma rkets 
gerber performed an assessment of this difficult financial environment and challenging global credit market situation and its potential impacts to its operations as of april  and updated through june  as a result of credit markets impact on revenue  gerber has taken measures to control costs in order to partially offset the impact of further revenue declines on its results of operations and cash flows from operations 
gerber has not experienced changes in credit availability from its lenders under the terms of its existing credit facility agreement  and does not anticipate such changes 
after assessing the consequences of this difficult financial environment  and although the duration and extent of future market turmoil cannot be predicted  gerber does not currently expect that the credit market conditions will have a significant negative impact on its liquidity  financial position or operations in fiscal as compared with fiscal as of april   cash balances were million and million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility  based on facility financial covenants 
gerber believes that cash on hand  cash flows from operations and borrowings expected to be available under the revolving credit facility will enable gerber to meet its ongoing cash requirements for at least the next months 
after this  gerber may require additional capital for investment in its business

during the fiscal quarter ended july   gerber filed a shelf registration statement for million of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  warrants  rights and units that gerber may offer and sell during the three year effective period of the shelf registration 
no securities were offered and sold pursuant to the shelf registration as of april  the actual amount and timing of gerber s future capital requirements may differ materially from the company s estimates depending on the demand for its products  new market developments or business expansion requirements  including potential business acquisitions 
if the company s plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  the foregoing sources of funds may prove to be insufficient and may require gerber to seek additional capital 
additional sources of such capital may include equity and debt financing 
if gerber believes it can obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  it may seek such financing at any time  to the extent that market conditions and other factors permit it to do so 
any inab ility of gerber to generate the sufficient funds that it may require or to obtain such funds under reasonable terms could limit its ability to increase revenue or operate profitability 
the continuation of impaired equity and credit markets and restrictions under gerber s revolving credit facility could adversely impact gerber s ability to raise any required funds

financial condition as of april   the united states dollar had weakened from april  against the euro  the pound sterling and the canadian and australian dollars  resulting in higher translated euro  pound sterling  canadian and australian dollar denominated assets and liabilities compared with april  the most significant portion of gerber s international assets and liabilities are denominated in the euro 
gerber s consolidated balance sheet as of april  reflected the acquired assets and liabilities associated with the yunique acquisition 
gerber s consolidated balance sheet as of april  included assets and liabilities related to the business units that were disposed of in fi scal net accounts receivable decreased to million as of april  from million as of april  the decrease  which was partially offset by foreign currency translation  was primarily attributable to lower revenue in fiscal  strong cash collections  the sale of foba and nd graphics and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
partially offsetting the decrease was the addition of acquired accounts receivable from the yunique acquisition 
days sales outstanding improved to days as of april  compared with days as of april  inventories decreased to million as of april  from million as of april  the reduction primarily reflected the sale of foba and nd graphics and was partially offset by foreign currency translation and investments in inventories for anticipated new product launches 
inventory turnover increased to times annually as of april  from times annually as of april  net property  plant and equipment decreased to million as of april  from million as of april   which reflected depreciation expense of million and the sale of foba and nd graphics  and was partially offset by capital expenditures of million and the impact of foreign currency translations

accounts payable and other current liabilities decreased to million as of april  from million as of april   primarily as a result of the timing of payments to gerber s vendors and employees and the reduction of certain liabilities related to the foba and nd graphics dispositions and was partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation 
days purchases outstanding increased to days as of april  from days as of april  the accrued pension benefit liability increased to million as of april  from million as of april   which primarily reflected the lower discount rate of percent used to value the liabilities as of april  from percent as of april  other long term liabilities increased to million as of april  from million as of april   which primarily reflected estimated discounted earn out liabilities of million that were incurred in connection with the yunique acquisition 
long term debt gerber entered into a credit agreement on january  with several banks and other financial institutions and lenders specified in the agreement and rbs citizens  na  in its capacity as administrative agent for the lenders and amended the credit agreement in march and november the lenders under the credit agreement have extended gerber a million senior secured revolving credit facility 
in addition  gerber may elect  subject to compliance with specified conditions  to solicit the lenders under the credit agreement to increase by up to million the total principal amount of borrowings available under the credit facility 
the credit agreement is gerber s primary source of debt and matures on january  outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at an annual rate equal to  at gerber s option  the defined applicable base rate  or abr  or the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus a variable margin 
an annual commitment fee is payable quarterly based upon the unused amount of the credit agreement at a specified margin 
the margins and commitment fees are based on gerber s ratio of total funded debt to consolidated ebitda as defined for purposes of the credit agreement  as shown in the table below total funded debt to consolidated ebitda ratio abr margin basis points libor margin basis points commitment fee basis points x and greater x to less than x x to less than x x to less than x less than x the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties  affirmative and negative covenants  financial covenants and events of default 
gerber s performance under the credit agreement is collateralized by first priority liens on selected assets and the pledge of capital stock of certain of gerber s subsidiaries 
the financial covenants in the credit agreement require gerber to maintain a maximum ratio of total funded debt to consolidated ebitda  a minimum ratio of consolidated ebit to consolidated interest expense  a maximum capital expenditures covenant of million and a minimum asset coverage ratio covenant all as defined for purposes of the credit agreement 
gerber was in compliance with its financial covenants as of april  the definition of ebitda in the credit agreement excludes  among other items  certain gains and expenses  including other than temporary impairment asset charges  non cash stock compensation  non recurring fees and expenses associated with the credit agreement amendments  and non cash purchase accounting adjustments that amortize into ebitda  and includes  among other items  pro forma ebitda from acquired companies 
gerber s financial covenant ratio of total funded debt to consolidated ebitda  as amended in november  is shown in the table below twelve month period ended covenant actual as of april  april  maximum july  and thereafter maximum not applicable gerber s financial covenant ratio of consolidated ebit to consolidated interest expense  as amended in november  is shown in the table below twelve month period ended covenant actual as of april  april  minimum july  minimum not applicable october  and thereafter minimum not applicable the asset coverage covenant ratio requires gerber to maintain at least a ratio of specified assets to total funded debt 
such assets include cash in the united states and canada  plus percent of consolidated net accounts receivable  plus percent of consolidated inventories and million for consolidated fixed assets 
the asset coverage covenant was amended in november to phase out the million allowance for consolidated net fixed assets over periods ending october  and thereafter 
additionally  the measurement of compliance with this covenant will change from being tested monthly to being tested quarterly after october  as of april   the company maintained an asset coverage ratio of gerber s future compliance with the financial covenants under the credit agreement depends primarily on its success in generating sufficient operating cash flows  which could be adversely affected by various economic  financial and industrial factors 
noncompliance with the covenants would constitute an event of default under the credit facility  potentially allowing the lenders to accelerate repayment of any outstanding borrowings 
in the event of failure by gerber to continue to be in compliance with any covenants  gerber would seek to negotiate amendments to the applicable covenants or obtain compliance waivers from its lenders 
the credit agreement contains subjective acceleration causes under which  upon the occurrence of a change in gerber s financial condition  business or operations considered by the lenders to be materially adverse to gerber  the lenders may cause amounts due under the agreement to become immediately due and payable 
the credit agreement also contains certain cross default provisions  which provide that default by gerber under other lending arrangements could cause gerber to be in default under the credit agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements gerber s participation in financing arrangements to assist customers in obtaining leases with third parties constitute gerber s only off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of the sec s regulation s k 
gerber has agreements with major financial services institutions  or lessors  to assist gerber s customers  or lessees  in obtaining lease financing to purchase gerber s equipment 
equipment is typically leased for periods of two to six years 
the equipment sold collateralizes the lease receivables 
in the event of default by the lessee  gerber has a liability to the financial services institution under recourse provisions once the institution repossesses the equipment from the lessee and returns it to gerber 
in most cases  gerber then can resell the eq uipment  the proceeds of which resale are expected to substantially cover a majority of the liability to the financial services institution 
as of april   the amount of lease receivables financed under the agreements between the external financial services institutions and the lessees was million 
gerber s net exposure related to recourse provisions under these agreements was approximately million 
as of april  and  gerber recorded undiscounted accruals for the expected losses under recourse provisions of million and million  respectively 
contractual cash obligations and commitments as of april   gerber had the following contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations lease obligations inventory and other purchase obligations qualified and non qualified pension funding total principal only  excludes interest payments 
the effective interest rate as of april  was approximately percent and outstanding borrowings were million 
the contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments table includes approximately million of expected contributions in fiscal for the qualified pension plan 
although gerber anticipates making contributions subsequent to fiscal  the amounts of any such contributions have been excluded from the table  since the timing of such contributions is based on pension plan assumptions that may materially differ from actual plan activities 
amounts included in the table for pension contributions in excess of one year relate to the funding of benefit payments under gerber s non qualified pension plan and a small international pension plan 
the above table does not reflect contingent acquisition payments including potential earn outs related to the acquisition of yunique in fiscal the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million  the timing of which is uncertain 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for more information about such tax benefits 
critical accounting estimates gerber s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and the most significant of these are described below 
actual results could differ from management s estimates 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value  with cost being determined using the first in  first out  or fifo  cost method 
inventory at the apparel and industrial segment s foreign non manufacturing companies is valued on a weighted average basis  which approximates fifo 
gerber reviews the market value of inventory on an ongoing basis and records inventory write downs as necessary to reflect estimated obsolescence  excess quantities and market value 
the amount of these write downs equals the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
excess and obsolete inventory is generally identified by comparing expected inventory usage to actual on hand quantities and inventory write downs are recorded when on hand inventory is in excess of pre defined usage estimates 
usage estimates are primarily determined by projecting historical actual inventory usage levels for future periods 
application of this methodology can have the effect of increasing inventory write downs during periods of declining demand 
inventories included a million reduction as of april  for the estimated lower of cost or market adjustment against gerber s standard costs 
goodwill gerber reviews the value of goodwill for impairment annually during its fourth fiscal quarter  or when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
no goodwill impairment was recorded during fiscal the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves subjective estimation of the fair value of reporting units  using substantial estimates and assumptions that could affect whether an impairment charge is recognized and the amount thereof 
to assess goodwill for impairment  internal valuation analyses are performed 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow analysis  which uses estimates and assumptions  including projected cash flows  and estimated discount rate assumptions and perpetual growth rates 
a percent decrease in the fair value of gerber s reporting units at the fiscal evaluation date would not have resulted in any goodwill impairments 
as of april   gerber had million of goodwill assets on its consolidated balance sheet which management believes are realizable based on the estimated cash flows of the associated businesses 
however  it is possible that the estimates and assumptions used in assessing that value  such as future sales and expense levels  may need to be revaluated in the case of further market deterioration  which could result in future impairment of those assets 
the gsp reporting unit s goodwill asset has a book value of approximately million 
as of the review for the fourth quarter of fiscal  gsp s goodwill was not considered impaired 
significant assumptions include inputs into discounted cash flow analysis that are used for measuring fair value such as future sales  new product launches and expense levels 
if there is a significant decline in projected results of new product launches  a goodwill impairment charge may be required in future periods 
the extent of the potential goodwill impairment charge will be based upon the facts  circumstances and estimates in existence at the time of the goodwill impairment analysis 
the remaining reporting units were not at risk of failing step one impairment tests as of april  pension plans effective on april   gerber froze future benefit accruals under the gerber scientific  inc and participating subsidiaries pension plan  or pension plan  and the gerber scientific  inc and participating subsidiaries supplemental pension benefit plan  or serp 
all benefits already accrued under the pension plan and the serp remained intact  and service credits for retirement eligibility continue in accordance with the terms of each plan 
the amounts recognized in gerber s consolidated financial statements for the qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans are determined from actuarial valuations 
these valuations use assumptions relating to  among other variables  the expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which liabilities could be settled and amortization methodologies for unrecognized actuarial losses 
these assumptions are updated at the measurement date and are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized in future periods 
the expected return on plan assets assumption is developed by considering current and expected target asset allocation  historical experience of returns by asset class type  a risk premium  an inflation estimate weighted towards future expectations  expectations for real returns  and adjustments for anticipated or historical economic changes using a long term investment horizon 
the effects of asset diversification and periodic fund rebalancing are also considered 
the long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for fiscal was percent and will be percent for fiscal with all other assumptions remaining constant  an increase or decrease of percentage points in the expected long term rate of return of the plan assets would increase or dec rease fiscal consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately million 
as of april  and  and for the fiscal years ended april  and ending april   the discount rate utilized for determining future pension obligations of the pension plans was based on gerber s estimated future cash payments compared to expected yields of high quality  long term corporate bonds from a benchmark yield curve 
the discount rate used for determining net periodic pension expense was percent for fiscal and will be percent for fiscal with all other assumptions remaining constant  a percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate for the plans would not significantly increase or decrease fiscal consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes 
the assumed rate of increase in compensation levels is no longer relevant to benefit obligations as of april  and thereafter as a result of the effect of the pension plan benefits freeze on april  pension expense for fiscal is expected to be approximately million 
in subsequent fiscal years  future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  contributions  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in gerber s pension plans 
income taxes generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
such principles also require that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  gerber estimates future taxable income  available tax planning strategies and the ability to realize tax loss and credit carryforwards 
in estimating future taxable income  gerber has analyzed its historical earnings in each jurisdiction and considered the effect of certain nonrecurring items that negatively impacted earnings in those periods 
gerber has also considered the favorable shift in profits between various jurisdictions resulting from tax planning strategies in assessing the ability to realize its deferred tax assets 
the realization of these deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax law  statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event gerber were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded as a reduction to income in the period such determination was made 
similarly  if gerber were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded as an increase to income in the period such determination was made 
the fasb issued accounting guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under such guidance  tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement assuming the tax authority has full knowledge of the position and all relevant f acts 
gerber operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
the internal revenue service and other tax authorities routinely review gerber s tax returns 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
the impact of these examinations on gerber s liability for income taxes cannot be presently determined 
in management s opinion  adequate provision has been made for potential adjustments arising from these examinations based on gerber s estimated range of exposure 
gerber has not recognized united states tax expense on the unremitted earnings and other basis differences with respect to certain of its foreign subsidiaries because it is not anticipated that such earnings will be remitted to the united states 
these undistributed earnings and basis differences were approximately million as of april  gerber plans to reinvest these earnings permanently outside of the united states or repatriate the earnings only when it is advantageous to do so 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu   multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu asu amends the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue generating activities 
asu amends the criteria for separating deliverables and measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendment also establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
significantly enhanced disclosures will also be required to provide information about gerber s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  including information about the nature and terms  s ignificant deliverables  and performance within arrangements 
asu also requires information to be provided about significant judgments made  changes to those judgments and how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
in october  the fasb issued asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  or asu asu changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that are essential to the functionality  and removes these products from current software revenue guidance 
the new guidance will include factors to help companies determine what software elements are considered essential to the functionality 
asu subjects software enabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements  such as guidance relating to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
both asu and asu are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning may  for gerber  although early application is permitted 
gerber plans to early adopt these provisions on may  using the prospective adoption methodology and does not anticipate a significant change to its current revenue recognition accounting practices as a result of adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk gerber is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
credit market risk exposures distress in credit and financial markets has reduced liquidity and credit availability and increased volatility in prices of securities 
after assessing the consequences of this difficult financial environment  and although the duration and extent of future market turmoil cannot be predicted  gerber does not currently expect that the credit market conditions will have a material adverse impact on its liquidity  financial position  operations or cash flows in fiscal as compared with fiscal foreign currency exposures gerber identifies and manages its foreign currency exposures at the corporate level and uses specific planning strategies by region and operation unit  which may include the use of foreign currency forward contracts  international tax transfer pricing strategies and intercompany loan planning strategies 
there were no foreign currency forward contracts in effect as of april  interest rate exposures gerber finances its operations primarily through variable interest rate debt and is thus subject to market risk due to interest rate volatility 
to moderate the impact of that volatility  gerber has entered into interest rate swap agreements that exchange variable libor interest for fixed interest rates of percent on million of revolving credit facility debt and percent on million of such debt 
as of april   all obligations under gerber s credit facility were fixed through interest rate swap agreements
