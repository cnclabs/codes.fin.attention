we also offer system design services and solutions for management  monitoring  and performance measurement to maximize capital investment and improve overall quality and performance over the entire lifespan of an installation 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  receivable reserves  inventory reserves  goodwill and intangible assets  contract losses and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting estimates were discussed with our audit committee 
the significant accounting policies that management believes are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
product revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an 
table of contents arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  delivery of the product to the customer has occurred and we have determined that collection of the fee is probable 
title to the product passes upon shipment of the product  as the products are typically shipped fob shipping point  except for certain foreign shipments 
if the product requires installation to be performed by us  all revenue related to the product is deferred and recognized upon the completion of the installation 
if the product requires specific customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs or the acceptance provisions lapse  unless we can objectively and reliably demonstrate that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions are satisfied 
when appropriate  we provide for a warranty reserve at the time the product revenue is recognized 
if a contract involves the provisions of multiple elements and the elements qualify for separation  total estimated contact revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element provided 
the amount of revenue allocated to each element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another element in the future 
revenue is recognized on each element as described above 
we perform funded research and development and product development for commercial companies and government agencies under both cost reimbursement and fixed price contracts through our discontinued applied technology division and through our engineering group 
cost reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs and  in some situations  the payment of a fee 
these contracts may contain incentive clauses providing for increases or decreases in the fee depending on how costs compare with a budget 
on fixed price contracts  revenue is generally recognized on the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated costs for the contract 
revenue from reimbursement contracts is recognized as services are performed 
in each type of contract  we receive periodic progress payments or payment upon reaching interim milestones and retain the rights to the intellectual property developed in government contracts 
all payments to us for work performed on contracts with agencies of the us government are subject to audit and adjustment by the defense contract audit agency 
adjustments are recognized in the period made 
the defense contract audit agency has agreed upon the final indirect cost rates for the fiscal year ended september  when the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs for product development contracts indicate a loss  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded 
as of december  and  we have accrued approximately million and million  respectively  for anticipated contract losses on commercial contracts 
for the year ended december  there have been no provisions for anticipated contract losses on commercial contracts 
with the sale of applied technology subsidiary we expect revenue from the percentage of completion type contracts or from cost reimbursement contracts in future periods to be nominal 
cost of product revenue includes material  labor and overhead 
costs incurred in connection with funded research and development and other revenue arrangements are included in funded research and development and other revenue expenses 
deferred revenue consists of payments received from customers in advance of services performed  product shipped or installation completed 
when an item is deferred for revenue recognition purposes  the deferred revenue is recorded as a liability and the deferred costs are recorded as a component of inventory in our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred revenue also consists of cash received for extended product warranties 
unbilled contract costs and fees represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed due to contractual provisions or deferred costs that have not yet been recognized as revenue or billed to the customer 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis 
table of contents of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write off experience 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory  and costs are determined based on the first in  first out method of accounting and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
we periodically review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and or obsolete inventory within cost of sales based primarily on our historical usage  as well as based on estimated forecast of product demand 
a significant decrease in demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases and an increase of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
warranty we offer warranty coverage for our products for periods typically ranging from to years after shipment 
we estimate the anticipated costs of repairing products under warranty based on the historical or expected cost of the repairs and expected failure rates 
the assumptions used to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated quarterly  at a minimum  in light of actual experience and  when appropriate  the accruals or the accrual percentage is adjusted based on specific estimates of project repair costs and quantity of product returns 
our determination of the appropriate level of warranty accrual is based on estimates of the percentage of units affected and the repair costs 
estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale of the related product  and are recorded within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
convertible debt instruments and warrant liabilities we accounted for our senior secured convertible notes the convertible notes  which were paid off on november   and associated warrants as a hybrid instrument 
the convertible notes included features that qualify as embedded derivatives  such as i the holders conversion option  ii our option to settle the convertible notes at the scheduled dates in cash or shares of our common stock and iii premiums and penalties we would be liable to pay in the event of default 
we irrevocably elected  as of january   to measure the convertible notes in their entirety at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either gain or loss 
subsequent to the pay off of the convertible notes  we will continue to account for the associated warrants as described above 
we recorded interest expense under the convertible notes based on the greater of i or ii the six month libor  in effect at the time plus basis points  as well as the amortization of the debt discount  which we computed using the effective interest method 
the debt discount represents the difference between our gross proceeds of million and the fair value of the convertible debt upon issuance  after separately valuing the investor warrants  the placement agent warrants and the convertible notes on a relative fair value basis 
by amortizing the debt discount to interest expense  rather than recognizing it as a change in fair value of the convertible debt instrument and warrants  which is a separate line item in our statement of operations  we believe our interest expense line item more appropriately reflects the cost of the debt associated with the convertible notes 

table of contents we determined the fair values of the convertible notes  investor warrants and placement agent warrants using valuation models we consider to be appropriate 
our stock price has the most significant influence on the fair value of the convertible notes and related warrants 
an increase in our common stock price would cause the fair values of both the convertible notes and warrants to increase  because the conversion and exercise prices  respectively  of such instruments are fixed at and per share  respectively  and result in a charge to our statement of operations 
a decrease in our stock price would likewise cause the fair value of the convertible notes and the warrants to decrease and result in a credit to our statement of operations 
if the price of our common stock were to decline significantly  however  the decrease in the fair value of the convertible notes would be limited by the instrument s debt characteristics 
under such circumstances  our estimated cost of capital would become another significant variable affecting the fair value of the convertible notes 
income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states  which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
the income tax accounting process involves estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of approximately million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we account for income taxes utilizing asset and liability method for accounting and reporting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using statutory rates 
in addition  we are required to establish a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the tax years through remain open to examination by major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject  which are primarily in the united states  as carry forward attributes generated in years past may still be adjusted upon examination by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities if they are or will be used in a future period 
we are currently not under examination by the internal revenue service or any other jurisdiction for any tax years 
we did not recognize any interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying financial statements 
we would record any such interest and penalties as a component of interest expense 
we do not expect any material changes to the unrecognized benefits within months of the reporting date 
redeemable convertible series b preferred stock we initially accounted for our series b preferred stock and associated warrants by allocating the proceeds received net of transaction costs based on the relative fair value of the redeemable convertible series b preferred stock and the warrants issued to the investors  and then to any beneficial conversion 
table of contents rights contained in the convertible redeemable preferred securities 
we determined the initial value of the series b preferred stock and investor warrants using valuation models we consider to be appropriate 
the series b preferred stock is classified within the liability section of our balance sheet 
to the extent that the series b preferred stock is subject to a remeasurement event  or is otherwise modified  the series b preferred stock will be reclassified to temporary equity 
redeemable convertible series c preferred stock we initially accounted for our issuance of series c preferred stock and associated warrants by allocating the proceeds received net of transaction costs based on the relative fair value of the redeemable convertible series c preferred stock and the warrants issued to the investors  and then to any beneficial conversion rights contained in the convertible redeemable preferred securities and classifying the series c preferred stock as temporary equity on the balance sheet between the captions for liabilities and permanent shareholder s equity 
we determined the initial value of the series c preferred stock and investor warrants using valuation models we consider to be appropriate 
the re pricing of the exercise price of the first tranche warrants from to  as described in the footnotes to the financial statements  was treated as a cancellation of the original warrants issued on november  and a re issuance or new warrants on december  the difference in fair value of the warrant was included in the allocation of net proceeds associated with the second closing of the series c preferred stock on december  we treated this as a deemed dividend on the series c preferred stock 
as of december  we recorded  as a deemed dividend to the holders of the series c preferred stock  which included the beneficial conversion feature of  and  related to the accretion of the series c preferred stock to its redemption value through the date that the holders of the series c preferred stock may first exercise their redemption right 
we are using the effective interest method to accrete the carrying value of the series c preferred stock through november   at which time the value of the series c preferred stock would be million  of its face value

this decrease was partially offset by an increase in our legacy power products offerings of million  or  due to the recognition of revenue on previously delivered legacy products in the early part of we expect legacy product revenue to decline as we continue to focus efforts on our renewable energy solutions 
gross margin 
total company gross margin decreased from in to in due to lower volumes during the period and transition costs associated with expanding our manufacturing and supply chain internationally while maintaining existing capacity in north america

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash  of which approximately  was restricted 
as of december   million is outstanding under our line of credit 
based upon our current working capital position  current operating plans and expected business conditions  we believe that our current cash  as well as the availability from our line of credit with silicon valley bank  will be adequate to fund our operations through december  beyond  we expect to fund our working capital needs and other commitments primarily through our operating cash flow  which we expect to improve as our product costs continue to decrease and as our unit volumes grow 
we also expect to rely on our credit facility to fund a portion of our capital needs and other commitments 
we have availability under our line of credit of million as of january  our funding plans for our working capital needs and other commitments may be adversely impacted if we fail to realize our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses  or if we fail to remain in compliance with the covenants of our bank line 
if either of those events occur  we may need to raise additional funds in order to sustain operations by selling equity or taking other actions to conserve our cash position  which could include selling of certain assets  delaying capital expenditures and incurring additional indebtedness  subject to the restrictions in the preferred stock financing and in the credit facility with silicon valley bank 
such actions would likely require the consent of the investors and or silicon valley bank  and there can be no assurance that such consents would be given 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such funds if they are required 
if additional funds are raised in the future through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and our stockholders will experience additional dilution 
the terms of additional funding may also limit our operating and financial flexibility 
there can be no assurance that additional financing of any kind will be available to us on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
failure to obtain future funding when needed or on acceptable terms would materially  adversely affect our results of operations 
we have incurred significant costs to develop our technologies and products 
these costs have exceeded total revenue 
as a result  we have incurred losses in each of the past five years 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million

the future minimum rental payments  as of december   under the capital and operating leases with non cancelable terms are included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
effects of inflation we believe that inflation and changing prices over the past three years have not had a significant impact on our net revenue or on our income from continuing operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through our investing and financing activities 
in addition  our ability to fund working capital requirements may be impacted if we are not able to obtain appropriate financing at acceptable rates 
our investing strategy  to manage interest rate exposure  is to invest in short term  highly liquid investments
