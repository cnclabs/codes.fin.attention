item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
competitive business conditions the oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive  particularly in the search for new oil and natural gas reserves 
there are many factors affecting panhandle s competitive position and the market for its products which are beyond its control 
some of these factors include the quantity and price of foreign oil imports  changes in prices received for its oil and natural gas production  business and consumer demand for refined oil products and natural gas  and the effects of federal and state regulation of the exploration for  production of and sales of oil and natural gas 
changes in existing economic conditions  weather patterns and actions taken by opec and other oil producing countries have a dramatic influence on the price panhandle receives for its oil and natural gas production 
the company does not operate any of the wells in which it has an interest  rather it relies on companies with greater resources  staff  equipment  research and experience for operation of wells both in the drilling and production phases 
the company uses its strong financial base and its mineral and 
table of contents leasehold acreage ownership  coupled with its own geologic and economic evaluations  to participate in drilling operations with these larger companies 
this methodology allows the company to compete effectively in drilling operations it could not undertake on its own due to financial and personnel limits and allows it to maintain low overhead costs 
sources and availability of raw materials the existence of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves in commercial quantities is essential to the ultimate realization of value from the company s mineral and leasehold acreage 
these mineral and leasehold properties are the raw materials to its business 
the production and sale of oil and natural gas from the company s properties is essential to provide the cash flow necessary to sustain the ongoing viability of the company 
the company reinvests a portion of its cash flow to purchase oil and natural gas leasehold acreage and  to a lesser extent  additional mineral acreage  to assure the continued availability of acreage with which to participate in exploration  drilling and development operations and  subsequently  the production and sale of oil and natural gas 
this participation in exploration and production activities and purchase of additional acreage is necessary to continue to supply the company with the raw materials with which to generate additional cash flow 
mineral and leasehold acreage purchases are made from many owners 
the company does not rely on any particular companies or persons for the purchases of additional mineral and leasehold acreage 
major customers the company s oil and natural gas production is sold  in most cases  through its well operators to many different purchasers on a well by well basis 
during  sales through three separate well operators accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total oil and natural gas sales 
generally  if one purchaser declines to continue purchasing the company s oil and natural gas  several other purchasers can be located 
pricing is generally consistent from purchaser to purchaser 
patents  trademarks  licenses  franchises and royalty agreements the company does not own any patents  trademarks  licenses or franchises 
royalty agreements on producing oil and natural gas wells stemming from the company s ownership of mineral acreage generate a portion of the company s revenues 
these royalties are tied to ownership of mineral acreage and this ownership is perpetual  unless sold by the company 
royalties are due and payable to the company whenever oil and or natural gas is produced and sold from wells located on the company s mineral acreage 
regulation all of the company s well interests and non producing properties are located onshore in the united states 
oil and natural gas production is subject to various taxes  such as gross production taxes and  in some cases  ad valorem taxes 
the state of oklahoma and other states require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and impose other regulations relating to the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas 
these states also have regulations addressing conservation matters  including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties and the regulation of spacing  plugging and abandonment of wells 
as previously discussed  the company relies on the well operators to comply with governmental regulations 
various aspects of the company s oil and natural gas operations are regulated by agencies of the 
table of contents federal government 
transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce is generally regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc pursuant to the natural gas act of and the natural gas policy act of ngpa 
the intrastate transportation and gathering of natural gas and operational and safety matters related thereto may be subject to regulation by state and local governments 
ferc s jurisdiction over interstate natural gas sales was substantially modified by the ngpa under which ferc continued to regulate the maximum selling prices of certain categories of natural gas sold in first sales in interstate and intrastate commerce 
effective january   however  the natural gas wellhead decontrol act the decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas 
because first sales include typical wellhead sales by producers  all natural gas produced from the company s natural gas properties is sold at market prices  subject to the terms of any private contracts in effect 
ferc s jurisdiction over natural gas transportation was not affected by the decontrol act 
sales of natural gas are affected by intrastate and interstate natural gas transportation regulation 
beginning in  ferc adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas 
these changes were intended by ferc to foster competition by transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of natural gas to the primary role of natural gas transporters 
as a result of the various omnibus rulemaking proceedings in the late s and the individual pipeline restructuring proceedings of the early to mid s  interstate pipelines must provide open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation related services to all producers  natural gas marketing companies  local distribution companies  industrial end users and other customers seeking service 
through similar orders affecting intrastate pipelines that provide similar interstate services  ferc expanded the impact of open access regulations to intrastate commerce 
more recently  ferc has pursued other policy initiatives that have affected natural gas marketing 
most notable are permitting the large scale divestiture of interstate pipeline owned natural gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non affiliated companies  further development of rules governing the relationship of the pipelines with their marketing affiliates  the publication of standards relating to the use of electronic bulletin boards and electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis  further review of the role of the secondary market for released pipeline capacity and its relationship to open access service in the primary market  and development of policy and promulgation of orders pertaining to its authorization of market based rates rather than traditional cost of service based rates for transportation or transportation related services upon the pipeline s demonstration of lack of market control in the relevant service market 
as a result of these changes  sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are able to conduct business with a larger number of counter parties 
these changes generally have improved the access to markets for natural gas while substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace 
the effect of future regulations by ferc and other regulatory agencies cannot be predicted 
sales of oil are not regulated and are made at market prices 
the price received from the sale of oil is affected by the cost of transporting it to market 
much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines 
effective january   ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation  subject to certain conditions and limitations 
over time  these regulations tend to increase the cost of transporting oil by interstate pipeline  although some annual adjustments may result in decreased rates for a given year 
these regulations have generally been upheld on judicial review 
every five years  ferc will examine 
table of contents the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced by the oil pipeline industry 
environmental matters as the company is directly involved in the extraction and use of natural resources  it is subject to various federal  state and local provisions regarding environmental and ecological matters 
compliance with these laws may necessitate significant capital outlays  however  to date  the company s cost of compliance has been immaterial 
the company does not believe the existence of these environmental laws  as currently written and interpreted  will materially hinder or adversely affect the company s business operations  however  there can be no assurances of future events or changes in laws  or the interpretation of laws  governing our industry 
current discussions involving the governance of hydraulic fracturing in the future could have a material impact on the company 
since the company does not operate any wells in which it owns an interest  actual compliance with environmental laws is controlled by the well operators  with panhandle being responsible for its proportionate share of the costs involved 
as such  to its knowledge  the company is not aware of any instances of non compliance with existing regulations and that  absent an extraordinary event  any noncompliance will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
although the company is not fully insured against all environmental risks  insurance coverage is maintained at levels which are customary in the industry 
employees at september   panhandle employed persons on a full time basis with five of the employees serving as executive officers 
the president and ceo is also a director of the company 
risk factors in addition to the other information included in this form k  the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating the company s business and future prospects 
the risk factors described below are not necessarily exhaustive  and investors are encouraged to perform their own investigation with respect to the company and its business 
investors should also read the other information in this form k  including the financial statements and related notes 
worldwide and in the united states  economic recession continues to have a negative effect on demand for and the price of oil and natural gas 
continuing effects of the economic recession could lead to a decline of oil and natural gas reserves due to curtailed drilling activity  risk of insolvency of well operators and oil and natural gas purchasers  limited availability of certain insurance contracts  and limited access to derivative instruments 
a decline in reserves would lead to a decline in production and would have a negative impact on profitability and company value 
oil and natural gas prices are volatile 
volatility in oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect results and the price of the company s common stock 
this volatility also makes valuation of oil and natural gas producing properties difficult and can disrupt markets 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been and will continue to be volatile 
the prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuation in response to a number of factors  including worldwide economic conditions  economic  political and regulatory developments  
table of contents market uncertainty  relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  availability and capacity of necessary transportation and processing facilities  commodity futures trading  weather conditions  import prices  political conditions in major oil producing regions  especially the middle east and west africa  actions taken by opec  and competition from alternative sources of energy 
in recent years  oil and natural gas price volatility has become increasingly severe 
price volatility makes it difficult to budget and project the return on exploration and development projects and to estimate with precision the value of producing properties that are owned or acquired 
in addition  volatile prices often disrupt the market for oil and natural gas properties  as buyers and sellers have more difficulty agreeing on the purchase price of properties 
results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of  among other things  variations in oil and natural gas prices and production performance 
a substantial decline in oil and natural gas prices for an extended period of time would have a material adverse effect on the company 
a substantial decline in oil and natural gas prices for an extended period of time would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  access to capital and the quantities of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced 
a significant decrease in price levels for an extended period would have a material negative effect in several ways  including cash flow would be reduced  decreasing funds available for capital expenditures employed to replace reserves or increase production  certain reserves may no longer be economic to produce  leading to both lower proved reserves and cash flow  and access to sources of capital  such as equity or long term debt markets  could be severely limited or unavailable 
we cannot control activities on properties we do not operate 
the company does not operate any of the properties in which it has an interest and has very limited ability to exercise influence over operations of these properties or their associated costs 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and the limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could materially and adversely affect the realization of targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and targeted production growth rates 
the success and timing of drilling  development and exploitation activities on properties operated by others depend on a number of factors that are beyond the company s control  including the operator s expertise and financial resources  approval of other participants for drilling wells and utilization of appropriate technology 
the company s derivative activities may reduce the cash flow received for oil and natural gas sales 
in order to manage exposure to price volatility in our natural gas  we enter into natural gas derivative contracts for a portion of our expected production 
commodity price derivatives may limit the cash flow we actually realize and therefore reduce revenues in the future 
the fair value of our natural gas derivative instruments outstanding as of september  was an asset of  
table of contents lower oil and natural gas prices may cause impairment charges 
the company has elected to utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and natural gas exploration and development activities 
exploration expenses  including geological and geophysical costs  rentals and exploratory dry holes  are charged against income as incurred 
costs of successful wells and related production equipment and development dry holes are capitalized and amortized by property using the unit of production method as oil and natural gas is produced 
all long lived assets  principally the company s oil and natural gas properties  are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be greater than its future net cash flows 
the need to test a property for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or unfavorable adjustments to oil and natural gas reserves 
once assets are classified as held for sale  they are reviewed for impairment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors  the company cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded 
if an impairment charge is recognized  cash flow from operating activities is not impacted but net income and  consequently  shareholders equity  are reduced 
our estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
it is not possible to measure underground accumulations of oil or natural gas in an exact way 
oil and natural gas reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices  future production levels  and operating and development costs 
in estimating our level of oil and natural gas reserves  we and our independent consulting petroleum engineering firm make certain assumptions that may prove to be incorrect  including assumptions relating to the level of oil and natural gas prices  future production levels  capital expenditures  operating and development costs  the effects of regulation and availability of funds 
if these assumptions prove to be incorrect  our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties  the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and our estimates of the future net cash flows from our reserves could change significantly 
our standardized measure is calculated using the month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month oil and natural gas price for each month within the month period prior to september   held flat over the life of the properties and costs in effect as of the date of estimation  less future development  production and income tax expenses  and is discounted at ten percent per annum to reflect the timing of future net revenue in accordance with the rules and regulations of the sec 
over time  we may make material changes to reserve estimates to take into account changes in our assumptions and the results of actual development and production 
the reserve estimates we make for fields that do not have a lengthy production history are less reliable than estimates for fields with lengthy production histories 
a lack of production history may contribute to inaccuracy in our estimates of proved reserves  future production rates and the timing of development expenditures 
further  our lack of knowledge of all individual well information known to the well operators such as incomplete well stimulation efforts  restricted production rates for various reasons and up to date well production data  etc 
may cause differences in our reserve estimates 
because forward looking prices and costs are not used to estimate discounted future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves  the standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 

table of contents the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  the ten percent discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows in compliance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement on oil and natural gas producing activities disclosures may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the company  or the oil and natural gas industry in general 
failure to find or acquire additional reserves will cause reserves and production to decline materially from their current levels 
the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted 
the company s proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced except to the extent that the company acquires additional properties containing proved reserves  conducts additional successful exploration and development drilling  successfully applies new technologies or identifies additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
future oil and natural gas production is therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves 
the above activities are conducted with well operators  as the company does not operate any of its wells 
drilling for oil and natural gas invariably involves unprofitable efforts  not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting drilling  operating and other costs 
in addition  wells that are profitable may not achieve a targeted rate of return 
the company relies on the operators seismic data and other advanced technologies in identifying prospects and in conducting exploration and development activities 
the seismic data and other technologies used do not allow operators to know conclusively prior to drilling a well whether oil or natural gas is present and may be commercially produced 
cost factors can adversely affect the economics of any project  and ultimately the cost of drilling  completing and operating a well is controlled by well operators and existing market conditions 
further drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  title problems  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  environmental and other governmental requirements  the cost and availability of drilling rigs  equipment and services and potentially the expected sales price to be received for oil or natural gas produced from the wells 
reserve estimates for september   calculated under the new sec reporting rules  modernization of oil and gas reporting requirements  are not directly comparable to reserve estimates made in prior years 
this report presents reserve estimates prepared using the new sec reporting rules  modernization of oil and gas reporting requirements  which are different in a number of respects from rules used for reserve estimates made in prior years 
the changes include permitting use of new technologies to determine proved reserves  if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes  enabling companies to additionally disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors  in addition to their proved reserves  allowing previously excluded resources  such as oil sands  to be classified as oil and natural gas reserves rather than mining reserves  requiring companies to report the independence and qualifications of a preparer or auditor  based on current society of petroleum engineers criteria  requiring the filing of reports for companies that rely on a third party to prepare reserve estimates or conduct a reserve audit  and requiring companies to report oil and natural gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period  rather 
table of contents than year end prices 
the result is reserve estimates beginning with the fiscal year ended september  will not be directly comparable to estimated reserves reported in previous fiscal years 
oil and natural gas drilling and producing operations involve various risks 
the company is subject to all the risks normally incident to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties and the drilling of oil and natural gas wells  including well blowouts  cratering and explosions  pipe failures  fires  abnormal pressures  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  brine or well fluids  release of contaminants into the environment and other environmental hazards and risks 
the company maintains insurance against many potential losses or liabilities arising from well operations in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts believed by management to be prudent 
however  this insurance does not protect it against all operational risks 
for example  the company does not maintain business interruption insurance 
additionally  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
these risks could give rise to significant uninsured costs that could have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial results 
future legislative or regulatory changes may result in increased costs and decreased revenues  cash flows and liquidity 
companies which operate wells in which panhandle owns a working interest are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation 
panhandle  as a working interest owner  is therefore indirectly subject to the same regulations 
new or changed laws and regulations such as those described below could have an adverse effect on our business 
federal income taxation proposals to repeal the expensing of intangible drilling costs  repeal the percentage depletion allowance and increase the amortization period of geological and geophysical expenses  if enacted  would increase and accelerate the company s payment of federal income taxes 
as a result  these changes would decrease the company s cash flows available for developing its oil and natural gas properties 
hydraulic fracturing the vast majority of oil and natural gas wells drilled in recent years  and future wells expected to be drilled  in which the company owns an interest were  or are expected to be  hydraulically fractured as a part of the process of completing the wells and putting them on production 
some members of congress have proposed legislation to either ban or further regulate the hydraulic fracturing process 
we cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted or  if enacted  what its provisions would be 
if legislation is passed to ban hydraulic fracturing  the number of wells drilled in the future may drop dramatically  and the economic performance of those drilled will be negatively affected 
legislation imposing further regulation of hydraulic fracturing may result in increased costs to drill  complete and operate wells  as well as delays in obtaining permits to drill wells 
climate change the epa has proposed regulations for the purpose of restricting greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources 
also  the us congress has considered legislation that would establish a cap and trade program in order to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane 
such regulatory and legislative proposals to restrict greenhouse gas emissions  or to generally address climate change  could increase the company s operating costs as operators of wells  in which the company owns a working interest  incur costs to comply with new rules 
the increase in costs to the 
table of contents well operators  and ultimately the company  as a working interest owner  could include new or increased costs to install new emissions control equipment  operate and maintain existing equipment  obtain allowances to authorize greenhouse gas emissions and pay greenhouse gas related taxes 
there also could be an adverse effect on demand for oil and natural gas in the market place 
shortages of oil field equipment  services  qualified personnel and resulting cost increases could adversely affect results of operations 
the demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations  geologists  geophysicists  engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly  often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices  causing periodic shortages 
there have also been shortages of drilling rigs  hydraulic fracturing equipment and personnel and other oilfield equipment  as demand for rigs and equipment increased along with the number of wells being drilled 
these factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment  services and personnel 
higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs  crews and associated supplies  equipment and services 
these shortages or price increases could adversely affect the company s profit margin  cash flow and operating results  or restrict its ability to drill wells and conduct ordinary operations 
competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  and most of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
we compete in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas acquisition  development  exploration and production 
we face intense competition from both major and independent oil and natural gas companies in seeking to acquire desirable producing properties  seeking new properties for future exploration and seeking the human resource expertise necessary to effectively develop properties 
we also face similar competition in obtaining sufficient capital to maintain drilling rights in all drilling units 
many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours  and some of them are fully integrated oil and natural gas companies 
these companies are able to pay more for development prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and are able to define  evaluate  bid for  purchase and subsequently drill a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit  effectively reducing our right to participate in drilling on certain of our acreage as a working interest owner 
our ability to develop and exploit our oil and natural gas properties and to acquire additional quality properties in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully evaluate  select and acquire suitable properties and join in drilling with reputable operators in this highly competitive environment

the established production decline curves  in conjunction with estimated future oil and natural gas prices  development costs  production taxes and operating expenses  are used to estimate oil and natural gas reserve quantities and associated future net cash flows 
as information is processed  over time  regarding the development of individual reservoirs and as market conditions change  estimated reserve quantities and future net cash flows will change as well 
estimated reserve quantities and future net cash flows are affected by changes in product prices  and these prices have varied substantially in recent years and are expected to vary substantially from current pricing in the future 
in january  the fasb updated its oil and natural gas estimation and disclosure requirements to align its requirements with the sec s modernized oil and natural gas reporting rules  which are effective for annual reports on form k for fiscal years ending on or after december  the update includes the following changes permitting use of new technologies to determine proved reserves  if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes  enabling companies to additionally disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors  in addition to their proved reserves  allowing previously excluded resources  such as oil sands  to be classified as oil and natural gas reserves rather than mining reserves  requiring companies to report the independence and qualifications of a preparer or auditor  based on current society of petroleum engineers criteria  requiring the filing of reports for companies that rely on a third party to prepare reserve estimates or conduct a reserve audit  and requiring companies to report oil and natural gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period  rather than year end prices 
the update must be applied prospectively as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate and is effective for entities with annual reporting periods ending on or after december  effective september   the company adopted the new requirements 
see note for disclosures regarding our natural gas and oil reserves 

table of contents the company is not able to disclose the effects resulting from the implementation of these changes on the financial statements or on the amount of proved reserves and disclosed quantities 
in order to accurately report the quantitative effect of applying oil and gas modernization rules  it would have been necessary for the company to prepare two sets of reserve reports  one applying the new oil and gas modernization rules and another applying the rules in effect at september  the company has interests in several thousand developed and undeveloped properties which are evaluated in the reserve estimation process 
the company has a total of eighteen employees including one petroleum engineer and one engineering tech 
staff time was not available for the engineering staff to perform necessary controls to ensure the accuracy of the report  for accounting personnel to recalculate dd a and re test for impairment of producing properties and be able to timely prepare and file this form k with the sec 
therefore  the company determined that it was not practicable to perform a second reserve estimation process under the prior rules 
proved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 
the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 
the area of the reservoir considered as proved includes i the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts  if any  and ii adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can  with reasonable certainty  be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or natural gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data 
in the absence of data on fluid contacts  proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience  engineering or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty 
where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated natural gas cap  proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience  engineering  or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty 
reserves  which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques including  but not limited to  fluid injection  are included in the proved classification when i successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole  the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir  or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based  and ii the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities  including governmental entities 
existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined 
the price shall be the average price during the month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report  determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within such period  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements  excluding escalations based upon future conditions 
developed oil and natural gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well  and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well 
undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled  unless 
table of contents evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances 
undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years  unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time 
under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated  unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty

all studies have been prepared in accordance with regulations prescribed by the securities and exchange commission 
the reserve estimates were based on economic and operating conditions existing at september   and since the determination and valuation of proved reserves is a function of testing and estimation  the reserves presented should be expected to change as future information becomes available 
estimated future net cash flows set forth below are estimated future net cash flows with respect to panhandle s net proved reserves based on the estimated units set forth in the immediately preceding table for the year indicated  and the present value of such estimated future net cash flows  computed by applying a discount factor as required by the rules and regulations of the sec 
estimated future net cash flows as of september  and have been computed by applying prices of oil and natural gas on september of each year to future production of proved reserves less estimated future expenditures to be incurred with respect to the development and production of these reserves 
as of september   the company adopted the new sec rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting requirements 
in accordance with the new sec rule  the estimated future net cash flows as of september  were computed using the month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month oil and natural gas price for each month within the month period prior to september   held flat over the life of the properties and applied to future production of proved reserves less estimated future development and production expenditures for these reserves 
the pricing used for each of the three years presented is in accordance with sec regulations in effect for each year

includes production taxes only 
the low production tax rate per mcfe in and is because of a large proportion of the company s natural gas revenue coming from horizontally drilled wells which are eligible for either oklahoma production tax credits or reduced arkansas production tax rates 
approximately of the company s oil and natural gas revenue is generated from royalty interests in approximately  wells 
royalty interests bear no share of the operating costs on those producing wells

all statements  other than statements of historical facts  included or incorporated by reference in this report  which address activities  events or developments which are expected to  or anticipated will  or may  occur in the future  are forward looking statements 
the words believes  intends  expects  anticipates  projects  estimates  predicts and similar expressions are used to identify forward looking statements 

table of contents these forward looking statements include  among others  such things as the amount and nature of our future capital expenditures  wells to be drilled or reworked  prices for oil and natural gas  demand for oil and natural gas  estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves  development and infill drilling potential  drilling prospects  business strategy  production of oil and natural gas reserves  and expansion and growth of our business and operations 
these statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the company in light of experience and perception of historical trends  current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors believed appropriate in the circumstances 
however  whether actual results and development will conform to our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
one should not place undue reliance on any of these forward looking statements 
the company does not currently intend to update forward looking information and to release publicly the results of any future revisions made to forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances  which reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events  after the date of this report 
in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the possible effects of some of these influences on any forward looking statements made  the following discussion outlines certain factors that in the future could cause consolidated results for and beyond to differ materially from those that may be presented in any such forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
commodity prices 
the prices received for oil and natural gas production have a direct impact on the company s revenues  profitability and cash flows as well as the ability to meet its projected financial and operational goals 
the prices for natural gas and crude oil are dependent on a number of factors beyond the company s control  including the demand for oil and natural gas  weather conditions in the continental united states which can greatly influence the demand for natural gas at any given time as well as the price we receive for such natural gas and the ability of current distribution systems in the united states to effectively meet the demand for oil and natural gas at any given time  particularly in times of peak demand which may result because of adverse weather conditions 
oil prices are sensitive to foreign influences based on political  social or economic factors  any one of which could have an immediate and significant effect on the price and supply of oil 
in addition  prices of both natural gas and oil are becoming more and more influenced by trading on the commodities markets  which has  at times  increased the volatility associated with these prices 
uncertainty of oil and natural gas reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their values  including many factors beyond the company s control 
the oil and natural gas reserve data included in this report represents only an estimate of these reserves 
oil and natural gas reservoir engineering is a subjective and inexact process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves depend on a number of variable factors  including historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices  future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs  and workover and remedial costs 
some or all of these assumptions may vary considerably from actual results 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas and estimates of the future net cash flows from oil and natural gas reserves prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially 
accordingly  oil and natural gas reserve estimates may be subject to periodic downward or upward adjustments 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to oil and natural gas reserves will vary from estimates  and those variances can be material 

table of contents the company does not operate any of the properties in which it has an interest and has very limited ability to exercise influence over operations for these properties or their associated costs 
dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and the limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could materially and adversely affect the realization of targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and targeted production growth rates 
the information regarding discounted future net cash flows included in this report is not necessarily the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to the company s properties 
as required by the sec  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves are determined based on the fiscal year s month average of the first day of the month oil and natural gas prices oil and natural gas prices used for and were based on the september spot price of each respective year and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net cash flows are also affected  in part  by the amount and timing of oil and natural gas production  supply and demand for oil and natural gas and increases or decreases in consumption 
in addition  the discount factor used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and the risks associated with operations of the oil and natural gas industry in general
