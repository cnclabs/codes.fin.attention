item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
we have based our forward looking statements about our markets and demand for our products and future results on assumptions that we consider reasonable 
actual results may differ materially from those suggested by our forward looking statements for various reasons including those discussed in cautionary statements concerning forward looking statements and item a 
business overview spartech is an intermediary processor of engineered thermoplastics  polymeric compounds and concentrates 
the company converts base polymers or resins purchased from commodity suppliers into extruded plastic sheet and rollstock  thermoformed packaging  specialty film laminates  acrylic products  specialty plastic alloys  color concentrates and blended resin compounds for customers in a wide range of markets 
we have facilities located throughout the united states  canada  mexico and france that are organized into three segments as follows of sales custom sheet and rollstock packaging technologies color and specialty compounds in  the company sold its wheels and profiles businesses and closed and liquidated three businesses including a manufacturer of boat components sold to the marine market  and one compounding and one sheet business which previously serviced single customers 
these businesses are classified as discontinued operations and all amounts presented within item are presented on a continuing basis  unless otherwise noted 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details of these divestitures and closures 
the wheels  profiles and marine businesses were previously reported in the engineered products group and due to these dispositions  the company no longer has this reporting group 
we assess net sales changes using three major drivers underlying volume  the impact of business acquisitions or divestitures and price mix 
underlying volume is calculated as the change in pounds sold exclusive of the impact on pounds sold from business acquisitions or divestitures and for a comparable number of days in the reporting period 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to october and generally contains weeks or calendar days 
because of this convention  every fifth or sixth fiscal year has an additional week and fiscal was reported as a week fiscal year containing days of activity 
executive summary we operated in a weak end market demand environment in due to significant declines in spending in the economy 
our sales volume decreased from and most of this decrease occurred in end markets that are more sensitive to discretionary spending levels including the transportation  recreation and leisure  and building and construction markets 
while we experienced challenging volume comparisons in  demand in many of our markets appeared to have stabilized by the end of the year  albeit at lower levels 
during the year  we executed improvement initiatives directed at reducing our cost structure  improving efficiency and increasing our organizational capabilities to manage through the challenging economy and position the company to benefit from leveraging a more efficient cost footprint upon sales growth 
the positive impact of these improvement initiatives led to an increase in earnings in in spite of our volume decrease and allowed us to pay down debt which positioned us at the end of the year with the resources available to fund future growth 
outlook sales volumes to most of our end markets have stabilized  albeit at lower levels of demand 
we are cautiously optimistic by this general stabilization and improved customer sentiment  but our operating plans assume the lower demand levels will continue through in addition  we continue to manage through a volatile raw material pricing environment 
we continue to execute our improvement initiatives and focus on maximizing cash flows 
we believe we are emerging from this recessionary environment as a stronger company that is better able to leverage its cost structure and better positioned to generate profitable growth and enhanced shareholder returns 

table of contents results of operations comparison of and consolidated summary net sales were million and  million in and  respectively  representing a decrease in the decrease was caused by underlying volume price mix underlying volume decreased due to lower demand across a broad group of markets including the transportation  building and construction  and recreation and leisure markets which decreased   and  respectively 
the price mix decline was primarily due to lower raw material costs which were passed through to customers as lower selling prices 
the following table presents net sales  cost of sales  and the resulting gross margin in dollars and on a per pound sold basis for and cost of sales presented in the consolidated statements of operations includes material and conversion costs but excludes amortization of intangible assets 
we have not presented cost of sales and gross margin as a percentage of net sales because a comparison of this measure is distorted by changes in resin costs that are typically passed through to customers as changes to selling prices 
these changes can materially affect the percentages but do not present complete performance measures of the business 
dollars and pounds in millions net sales cost of sales gross margin pounds sold dollars per pound sold net sales cost of sales gross margin the decrease in net sales per pound in the was caused by lower resin prices that were passed through to customers as lower selling prices 
the cent increase in gross margin per pound sold in reflects the favorable impact of improvement initiatives including operational improvements  cost reductions and a decrease in mix of lower margin sales to the automotive sector of the transportation market 
conversion costs decreased million  or  in due to the impact of our cost reductions and the lower sales volume 
these cost reductions included a one time change in our vacation policy and temporary compensation reductions that approximated a million total benefit in we expect the one time and temporary reductions to be replaced by additional structural cost reductions going forward 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  representing a million decrease versus the prior year 
the decrease was due to benefits from our structural cost reductions  million of lower oracle related costs  million of lower bad debts expense and approximately million from temporary compensation reductions 
amortization of intangibles was million in compared to million in due to assets that became fully amortized by the end of we recorded million and million of fixed asset and other intangible asset impairments in and  respectively  and million of goodwill impairments in additional details regarding these impairment charges are discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and exit costs were million in and million in the costs in both periods primarily consist of employee severance  facility consolidation and shutdown costs and accelerated depreciation resulting from 
table of contents improvement initiatives which include an objective of reducing the company s fixed portion of its cost structure without reducing production capacity 
in  we expect to incur approximately million of additional restructuring and exit costs for initiatives announced through october  which will mostly comprise employee severance and facility consolidation and shutdown costs 
in the future  we may announce additional cost reduction activities to support our strategy of reducing our cost footprint and attaining a cost structure that can be leveraged 
operating earnings for were million compared to a loss of million in the prior year 
operating earnings included asset impairments and restructuring and exit costs totaling million and million in and  respectively 
excluding the impact of these items  operating earnings increased million from the benefits of our improvement initiatives which more than offset the impact of our lower sales volume 
interest expense  net was million in and million in the lower expense in was due to reductions in our debt levels and interest rates 
our effective tax rate of in was impacted by recording an allowance on a deferred tax asset  operating losses from our operations in france for which we have not reflected a tax benefit and other nondeductible items 
our effective tax rate in was impacted by the significant goodwill impairments  some of which were not tax deductible 
excluding the goodwill impairments  our effective tax rate was in which was negatively impacted by operating losses from our operations in france for which we have not reflected a tax benefit partially offset by the positive impact of domestic state and foreign tax law changes in the first quarter of we estimate our tax rate to approximate and this assumes that we achieve break even results in france 
we reported net earnings from continuing operations of million in and a net loss of million in these amounts reflect the impact of the items previously discussed 
earnings from discontinued operations  net of tax were million in which compared to a million loss in the earnings in resulted from a million gain on the sales of our wheels and profiles businesses and the loss in mostly reflected asset impairments 
custom sheet and rollstock segment net sales were million and million in and  respectively  representing a decrease in this decrease was caused by underlying volume price mix most of our underlying volume decreases in this segment occurred in the transportation  building and construction  and recreation and leisure markets 
the price mix declines were primarily due to lower resin costs that were passed through to customers as lower selling prices 
this segment s operating earnings were million in compared to an operating loss of million in this comparison reflects restructuring and exit costs of million in and million in  respectively  and million of asset impairments in excluding the impact of these items  operating earnings increased approximately million in due to the benefits of improvement initiatives which more than offset the impact from the volume decline 
packaging technologies segment net sales were million and million in and  respectively  representing a decrease in this decrease was caused by underlying volume price mix the decrease in underlying volume reflected an decline to our packaging related end markets which represents approximately of this segment s total sales volume 
the remaining decline in underlying volume was attributable to the 
table of contents portion of this segment which sells to non packaging related markets 
the price mix declines were primarily due to lower resin costs that were passed through to customers as lower selling prices 
this segment s operating earnings were million in compared to million in the increase in operating earnings was due to the positive benefits of a higher mix of food packaging products and the benefits of improvement initiatives  including the mankato  minnesota facility consolidation 
color and specialty compounds segment net sales were million and million in and  respectively  representing a decrease in this decrease was caused by underlying volume price mix most of the sales volume decline in this segment occurred from lower sales to the transportation mostly automotive and building and construction markets 
volumes sold to these markets were lower by and  respectively  from the price mix declines were primarily due to lower resin costs that were passed through to customers as lower selling prices 
this segment s operating earnings were million in compared to an operating loss of million in this comparison reflects million and million of asset impairments in and  respectively  and restructuring and exit costs of million in and million in excluding the impact of these items  operating earnings decreased approximately million in due to the decrease in sales volumes  partially offset by benefits from our improvement initiatives 
corporate corporate expenses are reported as selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated condensed statement of operations and include corporate office expenses  information technology costs  costs of the shared services center  professional fees and the impact of foreign currency exchange 
corporate expenses were million in compared to million in excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange  corporate expenses were essentially flat in both period comparisons reflecting temporary compensation reductions and lower costs associated with the company wide oracle information systems implementation  offset by costs from the company s shared services functions  functions which previously occurred in the company s reporting segments 
comparison of and consolidated summary net sales were  million and  million in and  respectively  representing a decrease in the decrease was caused by underlying volume prior year additional week creative acquisition price mix underlying volume decreased because of lower end market demand and decreases in discretionary spending in the economy 
our volume sold to the transportation market declined from the prior year due mostly to lower volumes to the automotive sector 
volume sold to the recreation and leisure market was lower by  reflecting decreases in sales to recreational vehicles  pools  spas and marine sectors of this market 
most of the remaining underlying volume decrease occurred in the packaging market which declined from the prior year and our building and construction market which was lower by from the prior year 
the decrease in the packaging market was caused by lower purchases in the industrial and food packaging sectors of this market  and the decrease in the building and construction market reflected lower sales to the residential sector which were partially offset by an increase in volume sold to the commercial sector of this market 
the decrease in volume from the additional week reflects weeks of sales activity in compared to weeks in the increase from the creative acquisition represents the full year impact of sales dollars from this acquisition which 
table of contents occurred in september our sales comparison benefited from price mix due mostly to increases in sales dollars from the pass through of resin cost increases 
the following table presents net sales  cost of sales  and the resulting gross margin in dollars and on a per pound sold basis for and cost of sales presented in the consolidated statements of operations includes material and conversion costs and excludes amortization of intangible assets 
we have not presented cost of sales and gross margin as a percentage of net sales because a comparison of this measure is distorted by changes in resin costs that are typically passed through to customers as changes to selling prices 
these changes can materially affect the percentages but do not present complete performance measures of the business 
dollars and pounds in millions net sales cost of sales gross margin pounds sold dollars per pound sold net sales cost of sales gross margin the increase in net sales per pound sold in was caused by significant increases in our resin costs during the year which were passed along to customers as higher selling prices 
the cent per pound decrease in gross margin in reflects the decrease in our sales volume which exceeded our conversion cost dollar decline 
excluding the creative acquisition  conversion cost dollars decreased due to the volume decline and the impact of improvement initiatives which included reducing our labor related costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  representing a million increase over the prior year 
the increase was caused by the full year impact of our creative acquisition  higher information technology expenses to support our company wide oracle information system implementation  higher professional fees to support our improvement initiatives and higher bad debts expense  the impacts of which were partially offset by the extra week and a charge associated with the resignation of the company s former president and chief executive officer in amortization of intangibles was million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to the prior year creative acquisition 
the million of goodwill impairments and million of fixed asset and other intangible asset impairments in reflect non cash charges which were incurred in our custom sheet and rollstock and color and specialty compounds segments 
additional details regarding these impairment charges are discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and exit costs were million in and million in the costs mostly comprise employee severance  equipment moving expenses and accelerated depreciation resulting from the company s improvement initiatives 
the costs primarily represent employee severance  equipment moving expenses and accelerated depreciation associated with the shutdown of three former sheet production facilities and the movement of the business into the company s newly constructed facility in greenville  ohio 
the company reported a million operating loss in which compared to million of operating income in the million decrease reflected million goodwill impairments in  million increase in fixed asset and other intangible asset impairments and million increase in restructuring and exit costs 
the remaining million decrease was caused by the decrease in sales volume which was mitigated somewhat by the impact of improvement initiatives 
interest expense was million in and million in the higher expense in was due to the increase in debt to fund the creative acquisition and stock repurchases during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of 
table of contents our effective tax rate in was impacted by the significant goodwill impairments  some of which were not tax deductible 
excluding the goodwill impairments  our effective tax rate was in which compared to in our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by operating losses from non us operations for which we have not reflected a tax benefit partially offset by the positive impact of domestic state and foreign tax law changes in the first quarter of net loss from continuing operations was million in versus million of net earnings from continuing operations in these amounts reflect the impact of the items previously discussed 
loss from discontinued operations  net of tax was million in which compared to million of earnings in the loss in resulted from impairments on businesses which have been sold or liquidated 
custom sheet and rollstock segment net sales were million and million in and  respectively  representing a decrease in this decrease was caused by underlying volume prior year additional week price mix most of our underlying volume decrease in this segment occurred in the transportation  recreation and leisure  and building and construction markets 
volume sold to the transportation market decreased and occurred within the automotive and heavy truck sectors of this market 
the segment s volume to the recreation and leisure market was lower by reflecting lower sales of recreational vehicles  spas  pools and marine products 
we experienced a decline in volume to the building and construction market from decreases in sales of residential construction related products 
the price mix benefit was mostly from sales dollar increases from the pass through of resin cost increases 
this segment reported an operating loss of million in and operating income of million in this comparison reflects million of asset impairments in the remaining million decrease in operating earnings was caused by the lower volume and lower material margins in the early portion of because of a significant increase in resin costs that were not passed along to customers in a timely manner 
these adverse factors were partially offset by lower costs from our manufacturing cost optimization initiative and higher margins from improvement initiatives in the latter portion of packaging technologies segment net sales were million and million in and  respectively  representing an increase in this increase was caused by underlying volume prior year additional week creative acquisition price mix the decrease in underlying volume reflected a decline to our packaging related end markets  which represent approximately three fourths of this segment s total sales  and a decline in the remaining portion of this segment sold to non packaging related markets 
our creative acquisition provided additional sales of million in versus the price mix benefit was mostly from sales dollar increases from the pass through of resin cost increases 
operating earnings were million in compared to million in this decrease was caused by the decline in volume and lower underlying material margins from significant increases in resin costs in that were not passed along to customers in a timely manner due largely to indexed pricing arrangements 
these factors were partially offset by additional earnings contributed from creative and benefits from improvement initiatives 

table of contents color and specialty compounds segment net sales were million and million in and  respectively  representing a decrease in this decrease was caused by underlying volume prior year additional week price mix approximately three fourths of the sales volume decline in this segment occurred from lower sales of compounds to the automotive and industrial packaging markets 
these sectors of our end markets represented about half of this segment s sales volume and were lower by and for automotive and industrial packaging  respectively  from these losses were somewhat mitigated by an increase in volumes sold to the commercial construction market 
the price mix benefit was mostly from sales dollar increases from the pass through of resin cost increases 
this segment reported an operating loss of million in and operating income of million in this comparison reflects million of asset impairments in the remaining million decrease in operating earnings was caused by the lower volume which was offset somewhat by higher margins from improved mix and the impact of improvement initiatives 
corporate corporate expenses are reported as selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and include corporate office expenses  information technology costs  professional fees and the impact of foreign currency exchange 
corporate expenses were million in compared to million in the prior year 
corporate expenses increased in from higher depreciation expense  information technology related costs associated with the company wide oracle information system implementation and higher professional fees to support improvement initiatives 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operating activities and borrowings from third parties 
historically  our principal uses of cash have been to support our operating activities  invest in capital improvements  reduce outstanding indebtedness  finance strategic business acquisitions  acquire treasury shares and pay dividends on our common stock 
the following summarizes the major categories of our changes in cash and cash equivalents in  and cash flows in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in reflects higher generation of cash in the prior year from net working capital reductions 
reductions in net working capital funded million and million in and  respectively 
our primary investing activities in were the million of proceeds from the sales of our wheels and profiles businesses partially offset by capital expenditures 
we incurred million of income taxes on the sales proceeds 
capital expenditures are primarily incurred to enhance our facilities for safety  to improve productivity  and to modernize and expand facilities 
capital expenditures in were million compared to million in the million decrease in was largely attributable to our focus on cash management in the current year 
we expect our capital expenditures in to approximate to million 
net cash used for financing activities totaled million in and million in the net cash used for financing activities in included million to pay down debt and million to fund dividends 
financing activities during included million to pay down debt  million to fund dividends  million for treasury share 
table of contents purchases 
financing activities in also included million received from our chairman of the board to purchase treasury shares and million to pay fees associated with our debt refinancing 
as of october   we had million of cash of which million related to unremitted earnings in canada 
we can use this cash on a temporary basis to fund short term financing needs  however  a permanent distribution of this cash to the united states would result in approximately million of income taxes which has not been accrued 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the company s total accumulated earnings of its foreign subsidiaries of which the cash held in canada is a significant portion 
financing arrangements as of october   we had million of outstanding debt with a weighted average interest rate of  of which represented fixed rate instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 
as of october   we had million of borrowing availability under our most restrictive financial covenant 
while we were in compliance with our covenants during and currently expect to be in compliance with our covenants in the next twelve months  our failure to comply with our covenants or other requirements of our financing arrangements is an event of default and could  among other things  accelerate the payment of indebtedness  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in accordance with our debt agreements  we are required to offer early principal payments to our senior note and term loan holders based on a ratable percentage of our previous fiscal year s excess cash flow or extraordinary receipts such as proceeds from the sale of businesses 
we made early principal payments of million in the second quarter of related to our excess cash flow and million in december related to proceeds from sales of our profiles and wheels businesses 
we will offer million for our excess cash flow and if accepted  this payment would be made in the second quarter of our euro bank term loan matures on february  and  accordingly  million euros million us have been included in the current maturities of long term debt at october  other than the million euro bank term loan and the million excess cash flow payment discussed above  we are not required to make any other principal payments on our bank credit facility or senior notes in the next months 
our bank credit facility  senior notes and bank term loan are secured with collateral  which includes our accounts receivable  inventory  machinery and equipment  and intangible assets 
as of october   capacity under the revolving credit agreement was million  of which million was available under our most restrictive covenant 
our revolver capacity is permanently reduced by its pro rata share of early principal payments made to our senior note and term loan holders  and our capacity was reduced to million after the december extraordinary receipt payment and would be reduced to million upon acceptance of the excess cash flow payment 
in addition to the outstanding loans  the bank credit facility was also partially utilized by several standby letters of credit totaling million at october  we anticipate that cash flows from operations  together with the financing and borrowings under our bank credit facilities  will provide the resources necessary for reinvestment in our existing business and managing our capital structure on a short and long term basis 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october  and the estimated payments due by period in millions less than years years greater than contractual obligations total year and and years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other obligations total amounts included in long term debt include principal and interest payments 
interest on debt with variable rates was calculated using the current rate of that particular debt instrument at october  as discussed above  certain of our 
table of contents long term debt agreements are subject to mandatory prepayments  which include prepayments based on amounts of excess cash flow and from the net cash proceeds of asset sales 
because mandatory prepayments are based on future operating results and events  we cannot predict the amount or timing of such prepayments other than the million recorded as a current maturity of long term debt 
this mandatory prepayment was based on our excess cash flow during and would be paid during the second quarter of if accepted by the senior note and term loan holders 
actual amounts of interest may vary depending on principal prepayments and changes in variable interest rates 
purchase obligations primarily consist of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements 
the table does not include long term contingent liabilities  deferred compensation obligations and liabilities related to deferred taxes because the company is not certain when these liabilities will become due 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we must select and apply various accounting policies 
our most significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in order to apply our accounting policies  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  shareholders equity  revenues and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
in making such estimates  we rely on historical experience  market and other conditions  and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
accounting policies  estimates and judgments which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue as product is shipped and title passes to the customer 
we manufacture our products either to standard specifications or to custom specifications agreed upon with the customer in advance  and we inspect our products prior to shipment to ensure that these specifications are met 
we monitor and track product returns  which have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established 
despite our efforts to improve our quality and service to customers  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same or better return rates than we have in the past 
any significant increase in returns could have a material negative impact on our operating results 
allowance for doubtful trade receivables we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we monitor market and economic conditions as well as collections and payments from our customers 
we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon any specific customer collection issues identified  including market and economic conditions 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  actual credit loss rates may differ from our estimates 
any significant increase in credit losses in excess of our expectations could have a material negative impact on the value of our trade receivables and operating results 
inventory valuation and obsolescence we value inventories at the lower of i cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or ii the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we also buy scrap and recyclable material including regrind material to be used in future production 
we record these inventories initially at purchase price  and based on the inventory aging and other considerations for realizable value  we write down the carrying value to market value where appropriate 
we review inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete inventory 
a significant increase in the demand for our raw materials could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases  while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  most of our business involves the manufacture of custom products  where the loss of a specific customer could increase the amount of excess or obsolete inventory on hand 
although we make efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and operating results 
goodwill our formal annual impairment testing date for goodwill is the first day of the company s fourth quarter 
in addition  a goodwill impairment assessment is performed if an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process which requires us to make assumptions regarding fair value 
the first step consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using a number of factors  including projected future operating results and business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  discount rates  the allocation of shared or corporate items  and comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping 
we compare the estimated fair values of each reporting unit to the respective carrying values  which includes allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  the second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill 
this determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting 
table of contents unit 
any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to compute the goodwill impairment amount 
although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable  many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
these changes can result in future impairments that may materially affect the carrying value of our assets and our operating results 
note to the consolidated financial statements discloses the impact of charges taken to recognize the impairment of goodwill in and the factors which led to changes in estimates and assumptions 
long lived assets we review the carrying amounts of property  plant and equipment  other intangible assets and other long lived assets for potential impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the recoverability of a long lived asset  such assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets  and we compare the carrying value of each asset group with the corresponding estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows 
in the event the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable by future undiscounted operating cash flows  impairment may exist 
in the event of impairment  an impairment charge would be measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset group exceeds its fair value 
notes and to the consolidated financial statements disclose the impact of charges taken to recognize the impairments of fixed assets and other intangible assets and the factors which led to these impairments 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are recognized for credit carryforwards and then assessed to determine the likelihood of realization 
valuation allowances are established to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
expectations of future earnings  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the ability to carryback losses and credits to offset taxable income in a prior year  and tax planning strategies are the primary drivers underlying our evaluation of valuation allowances 
deferred tax amounts recorded may materially differ from the amounts that are ultimately payable and expensed if our estimates of future earnings and outcomes of tax planning strategies are ultimately inaccurate 
deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings on foreign consolidated subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are reinvested for an indefinite period of time 
if those undistributed foreign earnings were not considered indefinitely reinvested  we would be required to recognize approximately million to million of additional income tax expense 
we are required to recognize the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than percent likely to be ultimately realized 
tax authorities examine the company s tax returns in the jurisdictions in which the company does business 
the company assesses the tax risk of the company s return filing positions and has concluded its accruals for uncertain tax benefits are adequate as of october  contingencies we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business  including environmental matters 
our policy is to record expense for contingencies when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
estimating probable losses requires assessment of multiple outcomes that often depends on management s judgments regarding  but not limited to  potential actions by third parties such as regulators 
the final resolution of these contingencies could result in expenses different from current accruals and  therefore  have a material impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period 
for additional information regarding our significant accounting policies  as well as the impact of recently issued accounting standards  see note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities 
our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in interest rates on our floating rate debt facilities 
at october   we had million of debt subject to variable short term interest rates and million of fixed rate debt outstanding 
based upon the october  balance of the floating rate debt  a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates would cause an immaterial change in future net earnings  fair values and cash flows 
we are not currently engaged in any interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the fair value of our fixed rate debt is subject to changes in interest rates and the october  fair values of such instruments are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we are also exposed to market risk through changes in foreign currency exchange rates  including the canadian dollar  euro and mexican peso 
based upon our october  currency exposures  a hypothetical ten percent weakening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar would cause an approximate million decrease in future earnings  fair values and cash flows and have an immaterial impact against the euro and mexican peso
