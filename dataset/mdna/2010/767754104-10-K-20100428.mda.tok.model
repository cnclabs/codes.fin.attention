excluding these significant non cash charges  fiscal s net loss would have been million or per diluted share 
our operating results are described in detail in the results of operations section of this item some of the key factors that impacted our results in fiscal   and are summarized as follows write off of goodwill during fiscal  we impaired all of our existing goodwill  which resulted in a non cash charge of billion 
this entry was required due to the fact that the market value of rite aid corporation  as indicated by the trading price of our common stock  was less than the carrying value of our net assets as of february  income tax net loss for fiscal included income tax expense of million and was primarily comprised of an accrual for state and local taxes net of federal tax recoveries and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits 
the company maintains a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets 
asc  income taxes requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required 
a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
based on the negative evidence  asc precludes relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recognition of deferred tax assets 
net loss for fiscal included income tax expense of million 
the income tax expense was primarily due to a non cash write down of our remaining net federal and state deferred tax assets through an adjustment to our valuation allowance 
this change was primarily due to a decline in actual results from our previous forecast as a result of the impact of difficult economic conditions on fiscal results 
net loss for fiscal included income tax expense of million related to a non cash increase of the valuation allowance on federal and state net deferred tax assets 
store closing and impairment charges we recorded store closing and impairment charges of million in fiscal  versus million in store closing and impairment charges in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in charges for fiscal was largely due to the store closure activity and higher store impairment charges in fiscal driven by the decision to close stores that  due to the acquisition of brooks eckerd  were in overlapping market areas and the assessment that future cash flows from these stores would not be sufficient to cover their asset value 
lifo charges we record the value of our inventory on the last in  first out lifo method 
we recorded non cash lifo charges of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the higher lifo charge in fiscal was due to higher inflation on front end products in that year 
acquisition of brooks eckerd 
on june   we acquired all of the membership interests of jean coutu usa  the holding company for brooks eckerd  from jean coutu group  pursuant to the terms of the agreement dated august  as consideration for the acquisition  we paid 
table of contents billion in cash and issued million shares of rite aid common stock 
we financed our cash payment via the establishment of a new term loan facility  issuance of senior notes and borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility 
as part of the arrangement of the financing necessary to complete the acquisition  we incurred a million fee for bridge financing that ultimately was not needed 
this fee was recorded as a loss on debt modification in our statement of operations for fiscal as of february   jean coutu group owned million shares of rite aid common stock  which represents approximately of the total rite aid voting power 
we expanded our board of directors to members  with four of the seats being held by members designated by the jean coutu group 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a stockholder agreement the stockholder agreement with jean coutu group and certain family members 
the stockholder agreement contains provisions relating to jean coutu group s ownership interest in the company  board and board committee composition  corporate governance  stock ownership  stock purchase rights  transfer restrictions  voting arrangements and other matters 
we also entered into a registration rights agreement with jean coutu group giving jean coutu group certain rights with respect to the registration under the securities act of  as amended  of the shares of our common stock issued to jean coutu group or acquired by jean coutu group pursuant to certain stock purchase rights or open market rights under the stockholder agreement 
debt refinancing 
in fiscal years and  we took several steps to extend the terms of our debt and obtain more flexibility 
in fiscal  we refinanced our first and second lien securitization facilities 
the refinancing consisted of the issuance of million of new senior secured notes due october  commitments to increase the maximum borrowing capacity under our existing senior secured revolving credit facility from billion to billion  and an increase in the borrowings under our existing million tranche term loan due june by million to million 
additionally  we issued million of senior secured notes due june proceeds of which repaid all borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility due september and all of the commitments thereunder 
we also repaid all borrowings due under the million tranche term loan 
we incurred fees of million to consummate the fiscal refinancings 
in fiscal  we issued our convertible notes due may  the proceeds of which were used to redeem our notes due december additionally  we consummated a tender offer and consent solicitation and repaid million of our notes due may  million of our notes due june and the full balance of our notes due january proceeds from the issuance of our notes due july and our tranche term loan were used to fund the tender offer and consent solicitation 
we incurred charges of million to call these notes prior to maturity and write off unamortized debt issue costs 
dilutive equity issuances 
at february   million shares of common stock were outstanding and an additional million shares of common stock were issuable related to outstanding stock options  convertible preferred stock and convertible notes 
our million shares of potentially issuable common stock consist of the following shares in thousands strike price outstanding stock options a preferred stock convertible notes total and under to to to to to and over total issuable shares a the exercise of these options would provide cash of million 

table of contents results of operations the results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  have been adjusted to reflect the operations of our stores in the las vegas market area as a discontinued operation  as the company has sold the prescription files and terminated the operations of these stores

this decline consisted of pharmacy same store sales increase offset by a decrease in front end same store sales 
same store sales trends for fiscal and fiscal are described in the following paragraphs 
we include in same store sales all stores that have been open at least one year 
stores in liquidation are considered closed 
relocation stores are not included in same store sales until one year has lapsed 
pharmacy same store sales increased 
same store prescription growth was for fiscal  which was positively impacted by the growth of our rx savings card program  the benefit of grassroots marketing initiatives in our high volume front end low volume pharmacy stores and growth in our automated refill reminder program and other prescription compliance programs 
the impact on sales of the increase in our prescription count was partially offset by an increase in generic sales and reductions in pharmacy reimbursement rates 
front end same store sales decreased from the prior year  due to weakness in the overall economic environment and its impact on consumer shopping behavior and the impact of some of our initiatives  including our efforts to reduce costs  to reduce inventory  and to make changes to operating procedures for low volume stores 
fiscal compared to fiscal the growth in revenue for fiscal was driven primarily by the acquisition of brooks eckerd 
in addition  same store sales increased and 
table of contents consisted of pharmacy same store sales increase and a increase in front end same store sales 
same store sales include the results of the brooks eckerd stores for the last thirty nine weeks of fiscal and fiscal pharmacy same store sales increased 
increases in price per prescription were partially offset by increased generic penetration and a same store prescription decline 
the decline in same store prescriptions was driven by script count declines in the brooks eckerd stores  switches of prescriptions to over the counter medications and the overall economic environment 
same store script growth at the core rite aid stores was for fiscal and same store scripts declined for the brooks eckerd stores 
front end same store sales increased in fiscal  due to strong performance in our consumable and over the counter categories and improvement in our private brand penetration 
these items were somewhat offset by weakness in the overall economic environment  which had a negative impact on seasonal sales in the second half of the fiscal year and decreases in photo sales  which were due to the continuing trend of consumers printing fewer images as well as the disruption of services due to the conversion of our photo technology to fuji digital equipment 
front end same store sales for the core rite aid stores increased for the year  while front end same store sales for the brooks eckerd stores declined by

we expect the impact from these items to continue in fiscal  which could result in lower pharmacy margins 
front end gross margin was lower  as improvements in shrink and distribution costs were more than offset by a higher mix of promotional sales and lower inventory capitalization costs 
partially offsetting the decline in front end and pharmacy margins was a reduction in lifo expense 
gross margin rate was for fiscal compared to in fiscal the decline in gross margin rate for fiscal was driven primarily by a significant increase in our lifo charge  which is due to higher front end and pharmacy product inflation than in prior years 
pharmacy gross margin rate on a fifo basis improved due to an increase in the percentage of generic drugs dispensed and a lower cost of generics  partially offset by lower reimbursement rates 
front end gross margin on a fifo basis was flat  as improvements in shrink were offset by a reduction in photo sales 

table of contents we use the last in  first out lifo method of inventory valuation 
the lifo charge was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal was as a percentage of revenue  compared to in fiscal the decrease in sg a as a percentage of revenues is mostly due to a decrease in salaries and benefit costs due to better labor control and reductions in store operating expenses and corporate administrative expenses resulting from our various cost reduction initiatives 
sg a for fiscal was as a percentage of revenue  compared to in fiscal the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to increased intangible assets resulting from the allocation of the purchase price of brooks eckerd  an increase in rent and occupancy expenses due to new and relocated stores and the sale leaseback of owned stores 
these items were somewhat offset by a decrease in integration expense and advertising costs 
goodwill impairment in fiscal  we impaired all of our existing goodwill  which resulted in a non cash charge of billion 
this entry was required due to the fact that our market value  as indicated by the trading price of our common stock  was less than the carrying value of our net assets as of february  lease termination and impairment charges lease termination and impairment charges consist of amounts and number of locations as follows year ended february  weeks february  weeks march  weeks dollars in thousands impairment charges facility and equipment lease exit charges impairment charges number of stores number of distribution centers lease exit charges number of stores number of distribution centers impairment charges 
these amounts include the write down of long lived assets to estimated fair value at stores that were identified for impairment as part of our on going store performance review at all of our stores or management s intention to relocate or close a specific store 
the increase in impairment charges in fiscal was primarily due to current and projected operating results at these stores not being sufficient to cover the asset values 
facility and equipment lease exit charges 
charges to close a store  which principally consist of lease termination costs  are recorded at the time the store is closed and all inventory is liquidated  pursuant to the guidance set forth in asc  exit or disposal cost obligations 
we calculate our liability for closed stores on a store by store basis 
the calculation includes the discounted effect of future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term  net of estimated cost recoveries that may be achieved through subletting properties or favorable lease terminations 
we evaluate these assumptions each quarter and adjust the liability accordingly 
the increase in facility and equipment lease exit charges over fiscal is due to 
table of contents a higher level of stores closed in fiscal and and a decrease in the amount of assumed sublease income over the remaining minimum lease term 
as part of our ongoing business activities  we assess stores and distribution centers for potential closure 
decisions to close stores in future periods would result in charges for store lease exit costs and liquidation of inventory  as well as impairment of assets at these stores 
interest expense in fiscal   and  interest expense was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to higher cost debt incurred as part of our fiscal refinancings offset somewhat by lower libor rates and decreased borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the annual weighted average interest rates on our indebtedness in fiscal  and were  and  respectively 
income taxes income tax expense of million  million and million  has been recorded for fiscal  and  respectively 
net loss for fiscal included income tax expense of million and was primarily comprised of an accrual for state and local taxes net of federal tax recoveries and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits 
the company maintains a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets 
asc  income taxes requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we take into account all available positive and negative evidence with regard to the recognition of a deferred tax asset including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect recognition of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax planning strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
based on the negative evidence  asc precludes relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recognition of deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the existence of sufficient taxable income generated in the carryforward periods 
the fiscal income tax expense included non cash income tax expense of million related to the write down of our remaining net federal and state deferred tax assets through an adjustment to our valuation allowance 
this change was primarily due to a decline in actual results from our previous forecast as a result of the impact of current economic conditions on fiscal results 
the fiscal income tax expense included a non cash tax expense of million related to an increase of the valuation allowance on federal and state net deferred tax assets 
the existence of negative evidence at march   was primarily the result of recently completed acquisition of brooks eckerd and the impact on current year earnings due to planned integration and acquisition activities  compounded by the weakening economy during the second half of the year 
we monitor all available evidence related to our ability to utilize our remaining net deferred tax assets 
we maintained a full valuation allowance of  million and  million against remaining net deferred tax assets at fiscal year end and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources general we have three primary sources of liquidity i cash and cash equivalents  ii cash provided by operating activities  and iii borrowings under the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facility 
our principal uses of cash are to provide working capital for operations  to service our obligations to pay interest and principal on debt  to fund capital expenditures and to provide funds for payment of our debt

on june   we amended our senior secured credit facility to establish a new senior secured term loan in the aggregate principal amount of billion and borrowed the full amount thereunder

integration activities that require a temporary investment in inventory include replacing discontinued inventory  increasing the number of sku s at the brooks eckerd distribution centers and retrofitting the planograms in the brooks eckerd stores 
the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to conforming vendor terms as part of the integration efforts 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and prescription files which was offset in part by proceeds from asset dispositions 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and prescription files which was offset in part by proceeds from our sale leaseback transactions and proceeds from asset dispositions 
cash used in investing activities was  million in fiscal cash used was primarily for the acquisition of brooks eckerd and purchase of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets offset by proceeds from sale leaseback transactions and asset dispositions 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal due to proceeds from refinancings offset by a reduction in borrowings on our revolving credit facility and the payment of financing fees related to the refinancings 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal due to the net impact of proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and redemption of various notes  amending of our credit facility and principal payments on long term debt 
cash provided by financing activities was  million in fiscal cash provided by financing was primarily provided by proceeds from issuance of long term debt utilized to fund the brooks eckerd acquisition  net proceeds from our revolving credit facility  the change in the zero balance cash accounts and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock  offset by financing costs paid  scheduled debt payments and preferred stock dividends 
capital expenditures we plan to make total capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  consisting of approximately related to the new store construction and store relocation  
table of contents related to store remodels and related to prescription file purchases  infrastructure and maintenance requirements 
management expects that these capital expenditures will be financed primarily with cash flow from operating activities and use of the revolving credit facility 
future liquidity we are highly leveraged 
our high level of indebtedness i limits our ability to obtain additional financing  ii limits our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  iii places us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt  iv renders us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and v requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
based upon our current levels of operations  we believe that cash flow from operations together with available borrowings under the senior secured credit facility and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
based on our liquidity position  which we expect to remain strong throughout the year  we do not expect the restriction on our credit facility  that could result if we fail to meet the fixed charge covenant in our senior secured credit facility  to have any impact on our business in the next twelve months 
we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in light of our operating performance  and other relevant circumstances 
should we determine  at any time  that it is necessary to obtain additional short term liquidity  we will evaluate our alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds 
there can be no assurance that any such supplemental funding  if sought  could be obtained or if obtained  would be on terms acceptable to us 
from time to time  we may enter into transactions to exchange debt for shares of common stock in order to reduce our outstanding debt 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for uncollectible receivables  inventory shrink  impairment  self insurance liabilities  pension benefits  lease exit liabilities  income taxes and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
variability reflected in the sensitivity analyses presented below is based on our recent historical experience 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates and sensitivity analyses 
the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant judgments and estimates by management allowance for uncollectible receivables almost all of our prescription sales are made to customers that are covered by third party payors  such as insurance companies  prescription benefit management companies  government agencies  private employers  health maintenance organizations or other managed care providers 
we recognize and report receivables that represent the amount owed to us for sales made to customers  who are employees or members of those payors  which have not yet been paid 
we maintain an allowance for the amount of these receivables deemed to be uncollectible 
this allowance is calculated based upon historical collection and write off activity adjusted for current conditions 
the estimated bad debt write off rate is calculated by dividing historical write offs for the most recent twelve months  for which collection activities have been completed  by third party payor sales for the same period 
a bad debt expense is recognized by applying the estimated write off rate to 
table of contents third party payor sales for the period 
there have been no significant changes in the assumptions used to calculate our estimated write off rate over the past three years 
if the financial condition of the payors were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  an additional reserve would be recorded in the period in which the change in financial condition first became known 
based on current conditions  we do not expect a significant change to our write off rate in future periods 
a one basis point difference in our estimated write off rate for the year ended february   would have affected pretax income by approximately million 
inventory the carrying value of our inventory is reduced by a reserve for estimated shrink losses that occur between physical inventory dates 
when estimating these losses  we consider historical loss results at specific locations including stores and distribution centers  as well as overall loss trends as determined during physical inventory procedures 
the estimated shrink rate is calculated by dividing historical shrink results for stores inventoried in the most recent six months by the sales for the same period 
shrink expense is recognized by applying the estimated shrink rate to sales since the last physical inventory 
there have been no significant changes in the assumptions used to calculate our shrink rate over the last three years 
although possible  we do not expect a significant change to our shrink rate in future periods 
a basis point difference in our estimated shrink rate for the year ended february   would have affected pre tax income by approximately million 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable 
we have identified each store as an asset group for purposes of performing this evaluation 
our evaluation of whether possible impairment indicators exist includes comparing future cash flows expected to be generated by the store to the carrying value of the store s assets 
if the estimated future cash flows of the asset group store level are less than the carrying amount of the store s assets  we calculate an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the store s assets to the fair value of such assets 
we determine fair value by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the store discussed above 
cash flows are calculated utilizing the detailed store financial plan for the year immediately following the current year end 
to arrive at cash flow estimates for additional future years  we project sales growth by store consistent with our overall business planning objectives and results  and determine the incremental cash flow that such sales growth will contribute to that store s operations 
the discount rate used is our credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
the assumptions utilized in calculating impairment are updated annually 
should actual sales growth rates and related incremental cash flow differ from those forecasted and projected  we may incur future impairment charges related to the stores being evaluated 
changes in our discount rate of basis points would not have a material impact on the total impairment recorded in fiscal self insurance liabilities we expense claims for self insured medical  dental  workers compensation and general liability insurance coverage as incurred including an estimate for claims incurred but not paid 
the expense for self insured medical and dental claims incurred but not paid is determined by multiplying the average claim value paid over the most recent twelve months by the average number of days from the same period between when the claims were incurred and paid 
there have been no significant changes in assumptions used to determine days lag over the last three years 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was previously estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was anticipated  expense recorded may not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
a one day change in days lag for the year ended february   would have affected pretax income by approximately million 
the expense for self insured workers compensation and general liability claims incurred but not paid is determined using several factors  including historical claims experience and development  severity of claims  medical costs and the time needed to settle claims 
we discount the estimated expense for workers compensation to present value as the time period from incurrence of the claim to 
table of contents final settlement can be several years 
we base our estimates for such timing on previous settlement activity 
the discount rate is based on the current market rates for treasury bills that approximate the average time to settle the workers compensation claims 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis 
a basis point difference in the discount rate for the year ended february   would have affected pretax income by approximately million 
benefit plan accrual we have several defined benefit plans  under which participants earn a retirement benefit based upon a formula set forth in the plan 
we record expense related to these plans using actuarially determined amounts that utilize various assumptions 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the mortality rate  the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in future compensation levels 
these rates are updated annually and are based on available public information  market interest rates and internal plans regarding compensation and any other changes impacting benefits 
these assumptions have not significantly changed over the last three years  except that the discount rate has been adjusted due to changes in rates derived from published high quality long term bond indices  the terms of which approximate the term of the cash flows to pay the accumulated benefit obligations when due 
a decrease of basis points in the discount rate  assuming no other changes in the estimates  increases the amount of the projected benefit obligation and the related required expense by million and million  respectively 
lease exit liabilities we record reserves for closed stores based on future lease commitments  anticipated ancillary occupancy costs and anticipated future subleases of properties 
the reserves are calculated at the individual location level and the assumptions are assessed at that level 
the reserve for lease exit liabilities is discounted using a credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
reserve estimates and related assumptions are updated on a quarterly basis 
a substantial amount of our closed stores were closed prior to our adoption of asc  exit or disposal cost obligations 
therefore  if interest rates change  reserves may be increased or decreased 
in addition  changes in the real estate leasing markets can have an impact on the reserve 
as of february   a basis point variance in the credit adjusted risk free interest rate would have affected pretax income by approximately million for fiscal income taxes we currently have net operating loss nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes 
these nols generate significant deferred tax assets which are currently offset by a valuation allowance 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence including our historical profitability  projected taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
the weight given to the potential effect of the negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
we establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
there have been no significant changes in the assumptions used to calculate our valuation allowance over the last three years 
however  changes in market conditions and the impact of the acquisition of brooks eckerd on operations have caused changes in the valuation allowance from period to period which were included in the tax provision in the period of change 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc  income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
litigation reserves we are involved in litigation on an on going basis 
we accrue our best estimate of the probable loss related to legal claims 
such estimates are based upon a combination of litigation 
table of contents and settlement strategies 
these estimates are updated as the facts and circumstances of the cases develop and or change 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our best estimate of the probable liability may also change 
changes to these reserves during the last three fiscal years were not material 
adjusted ebitda in addition to net income determined in accordance with gaap  we use certain non gaap measures in assessing our operating performance 
we believe the adjusted non gaap measure serves as an appropriate measure to be used in evaluating the performance of our business 
we define adjusted ebitda as net loss excluding the impact of income taxes  interest expense and securitization costs  depreciation and amortization  lifo adjustments  charges or credits for facility closing and impairment  inventory write down liquidation expenses  stock based compensation expense  debt modifications and retirements  sale of assets and investments and other items 
we reference this non gaap financial measure frequently in our decision making because it provides supplemental information that facilitates internal comparisons to the historical operating performance of prior periods and external comparisons to competitors historical operating performance and gives a better indication of our core operating performance 
in addition  we base incentive compensation and our forward looking estimates on adjusted ebitda to facilitate quantification of planned business activities and enhance subsequent follow up 
we include this non gaap financial measure in our earnings announcement and guidance in order to provide transparency to our investors and enable investors to better compare our operating performance with the operating performance of our competitors 
management believes that adjusted ebitda also facilitates comparisons of our results of operations with those of companies having different capital structures 
however  we do not  and do not recommend that adjusted non gaap measures are solely used to assess our financial performance or to formulate investment decisions 
additionally  our definition of adjusted ebitda may not be calculated in the same manner as other companies 
the following is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our net loss for fiscal  and february  weeks february  weeks march  weeks net loss interest expense and securitization costs income tax expense depreciation and amortization expense lifo charges goodwill impairment charge lease termination and impairment charges stock based compensation expense gain loss on sale of assets  net loss on debt modifications and retirements  net incremental acquisition costs closed facility liquidation expense severance costs other adjusted ebitda 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future earnings  cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense 
we enter into debt obligations to support capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of variable rate credit facilities  fixed rate long term obligations and derivative transactions 
we currently do not have any derivative transactions outstanding 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of february  thereafter total fair value at february  dollars in thousands long term debt  including current portion  excluding capital lease obligations fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate our ability to satisfy our interest payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our interest payment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we cannot be assured that any replacement borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed 
the interest rate on our variable rate borrowings  which include our revolving credit facility and our tranche term loans  tranche term loans and tranche term loans  are all based on libor 
however  the interest rate on our revolving credit facility  tranche term loans and tranche term loans all have a libor floor of basis points 
therefore  at year end  given the current interest rate environment  the only instrument that was subject to libor fluctuations was our tranche term loans 
if the market rates of interest for libor changed by basis points as of february   our annual interest expense would change by approximately million 
a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed rate debt instruments 
as fixed rate debt matures  however  and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment  future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates 
this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures
