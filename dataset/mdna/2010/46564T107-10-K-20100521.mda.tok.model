item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in part iv  item of this report and the risk factors section in item a  as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this report  before deciding to purchase  hold or sell our common stock 
overview general 
we are a leader in the traffic management market focused on the development and application of advanced technologies that reduce traffic congestion and improve the safety of surface transportation systems infrastructure 
additionally  we believe our products and services  as well as sound traffic management  minimize the environmental impact of traffic congestion 
by combining outdoor image processing  traffic engineering and information technology  we offer a broad range of its and driver safety solutions to customers in the us and internationally 
business segments 
we currently operate in three reportable segments roadway sensors  vehicle sensors and transportation systems 
the roadway sensors segment includes our vantage  versicam and pico vehicle detection systems for traffic intersection control  incident detection and certain highway traffic data collection applications 
the vehicle sensors segment includes our ldw products and is comprised of all of our activities related to in vehicle safety 
the transportation systems segment includes transportation engineering and consulting services  and the development of transportation management and traveler information systems for the its industry 

table of contents our roadway sensors segment product line uses advanced image processing technology to capture and analyze video images through sophisticated algorithms  enabling vehicle detection and transmission of both video images and data using various communication technologies 
our vantage video detection systems detect vehicle presence  count  speed and other traffic data used in traffic management systems 
our vantage systems give traffic managers the ability to mitigate roadway congestion by modifying traffic signal timing or detecting incidents quickly 
versicam  our integrated camera and processor video detection system  is a cost efficient video detection system for smaller intersections that require only a few detection points 
pico  our compact video detection system introduced in december  was developed primarily to address international video detection needs  and was designed for easy installation and configuration 
we anticipate that future growth domestically and internationally  particularly in developing countries  will be dependent in part on the continued adoption of above ground video detection technologies  instead of traditional in pavement loop technology  to manage traffic 
our vehicle sensors segment addresses the leading cause of roadway fatalities lane change  roadway departure and rear end collision accidents 
we developed the world s first production ldw system and offer a proven system that is available as an oem and aftermarket option on heavy trucks worldwide and as an option in certain passenger cars 
our ldw products utilize video detection images to detect when a vehicle begins to drift toward an unintended lane change 
when this occurs  the unit automatically emits a distinctive rumble strip or other audible warning sound  alerting the driver to make a correction 
we believe that as a result of the expected eu mandate for ldw and other active safety systems  and an overall awareness of the potential benefits of ldw  that we will experience an even higher degree of competition from a variety of tier one oem suppliers and other potential market entrants  worldwide 
while we believe that this increased competition validates the long term market opportunity for ldw systems in commercial vehicles  it could also adversely effect our future ldw sales and margins 
we are currently working with our european oem customer base to establish long term supply agreements that extend to and beyond in order to meet the anticipated increase in demand  however  we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or that the increase in demand will occur 
we have entered into an exclusive license of our ldw technology to our strategic partner  valeo  for the passenger car market 
additionally  we and our partner have experienced a greater degree of competition in the passenger car market 
several passenger car oems have recently introduced vehicle platforms with competing ldw systems 
however  valeo continues to pursue opportunities in the passenger car market 
in addition to our ldw systems  our vehicle sensors portfolio includes radar based forward collision warning and blind spot warning systems for the north american truck market  which were both introduced in august  and our safetydirect product  a system that reports driver performance data captured by our ldw system  and has the ability to relay this data directly to fleet operators through integration with the truck s existing fleet communications system 
we offer the fcw and bsw features through the resale of delphi s radar based systems  for which we are the exclusive north american dealer  while safetydirect was internally developed 
these products  together with our ldw products  combine to create a suite of active safety driver assistance features focused on reducing the number of motor vehicle crashes and the severity of crash related injuries 
our transportation systems segment includes transportation engineering and consulting services focused on the planning  design  development and implementation of software based systems that integrate sensors  video surveillance  computers  and advanced communications equipment to enable public agencies to monitor  control and direct traffic flow  assist in the quick dispatch of emergency crews and distribute real time information about traffic conditions 
our services include planning  design and implementation of surface transportation infrastructure systems 
we perform analysis and study goods movement  commercial vehicle operations  travel demand forecasting and systems engineering  and identify mitigation measures to reduce traffic congestion 
historically  these services and systems have primarily been sold to local  state and national transportation agencies in the united states under a broad range of fixed price and cost plus fixed fee contracts  however  in the current fiscal year  we began work on our first two overseas contract awards in abu dhabi and dubai 
we plan to continue to pursue additional international opportunities for our transportation systems segment 
our transportation systems segment is largely dependent upon governmental funding and is affected by state and local budgetary issues 
we believe the overall expansion of our transportation systems segment in recent years past was due in part to the passage of the federal highway bill in  combined with increased transportation funds available at state and local agencies throughout the country 
the federal highway bill expired on october   and congress is currently in negotiations regarding future extensions 
we anticipate delays in the enactment of a new federal highway bill  and until such time as a bill becomes law  the allotment of transportation funds in federal  state and local budgets may be uncertain and we believe that prolonged uncertainty may adversely impact our net sales and contract revenues and our overall financial performance in future periods 

table of contents business trends 
looking forward  we remain cautious about our business  given the continued uncertain global economic conditions and the challenging financial markets 
this unfavorable environment has  and may continue to  negatively affect demand for our products and services for the foreseeable future 
likewise  our ability to accurately forecast business trends may be impaired 
despite the federal stimulus package that was passed in  many municipalities and other state and local agencies continue to face budgetary issues 
as a result  spending for new roadways  new systems to address traffic congestion and other transportation infrastructure improvements has been delayed or eliminated in some cases 
we believe that the need to rebuild and modernize aging transportation infrastructure will continue  and in addition to funds available through the stimulus package and federal highway bills  there exist a variety of other funding mechanisms that support transportation infrastructure and related projects  including bonds  dedicated sales and gas tax measures and other alternative funding sources 
however  we currently cannot determine when or if such funding sources will be available or the extent to which we may benefit from future sources of funding for transportation related projects 
during fiscal  we introduced certain new products including abacus and pico 
we also completed the acquisition of certain assets of hamilton signal  which included the abacus system  for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately  this acquisition has afforded us with the opportunity to provide our customers with traffic and incident detection data from our installed base of surveillance cameras 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements included herein  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable  the valuation of inventories  the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  the realizability of deferred tax assets  accounting for stock based compensation  the valuation of equity instruments  warranty reserves and other contingencies 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions by their nature involve risks and uncertainties  and may prove to be inaccurate 
in the event that any of our estimates or assumptions are inaccurate in any material respect  it could have a material adverse effect on our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record product revenues and related costs of sales upon transfer of title  which is generally upon shipment or  if required  upon acceptance by the customer  provided that we believe collectibility of the net sales amount is reasonably assured 
accordingly  at the date revenue is recognized  the significant uncertainties concerning the sale have been resolved 
contract revenues are derived primarily from long term contracts with governmental agencies 
contract revenues include costs incurred plus a portion of estimated fees or profits determined using the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to earnings when identified 
changes in job performance and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to recognized costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
profit incentives are included in revenue when their realization is reasonably assured 
under the percentage of completion method  recognition of profit is dependent upon the accuracy of a variety of estimates  including engineering progress  materials quantities  and achievement of milestones  incentives  penalty provisions  labor productivity  cost estimates and others 
such estimates are based on various professional judgments we make with respect to those factors and are subject to change as the project proceeds and new information becomes available 
in addition to product and contract revenues  we derive revenue from the provision of specific non recurring contract engineering services to our strategic partner  valeo  related to our ldw systems  and royalties earned on unit sales of our ldw systems by valeo to the passenger car market 
non recurring contract engineering revenues are recognized in the period in which the related services are performed 
royalty revenues are recorded based on unit sales of our products by valeo and are recognized in the period in which such sales occur 
non recurring contract engineering revenues and royalty revenues are included in our net sales 

table of contents revenues from follow on service and support  for which we generally charge separately  are recorded in the period in which the services are performed and are included in our net sales 
accounts receivable 
we estimate the collectibility of customer receivables on an ongoing basis by reviewing invoices outstanding greater than a certain period of time 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for specific receivables deemed to be at risk for collection as well as a general allowance based on our historical collections experience 
considerable judgment is required in assessing and estimating the ultimate realization of trade receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
inventories 
inventories consist of finished goods  work in process and raw materials and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we write down the carrying value of our inventories to net realizable value for estimated excess and obsolete inventories in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventories and their estimated realizable value 
these estimates are based on management s judgments and assumptions as to future demand requirements and our evaluation of market conditions 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
estimated inventory write downs  once established  are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped  so if actual market conditions are more favorable in the fiscal periods subsequent to those in which we record significant write downs  we may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter at the reporting unit level unless a change in circumstances indicates that more frequent impairment analysis is required 
we have determined that our reporting units for purposes of testing for goodwill impairment are identical to our reportable segments for financial reporting purposes 
impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the reporting units with the recorded goodwill 
the fair value of our reporting units is determined by using the income approach methodology of valuation which utilizes discounted cash flows 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units also includes a control premium  which is the amount that a buyer is willing to pay over the current market price of a company as indicated by the traded price per share ie  market capitalization  in order to acquire a controlling interest 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use the financial assumptions in our current budget and our current strategic plan  subject to modification as considered necessary  including sales and expense growth rates and the discount rates we estimate to represent our cost of funds 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates we use may be incorrect 
we performed annual impairment assessments of the carrying value of goodwill for each of the fiscal years ended march   and based on these assessments  we determined that no impairment as of each of these dates was indicated as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value 
at march   our roadway sensors  vehicle sensors and transportation systems reporting units had goodwill balances of million  million and million  respectively 
based on our assessment at march   the estimated fair values of our roadway sensors  vehicle sensors and transportation systems reporting units were approximately  and  respectively  greater than their respective carrying values 
among other factors  the fair value of our transportation systems reporting unit in the future could be adversely impacted by i our inability to maintain adequate utilization of our workforce  ii our failure to successfully bid on new contracts and renew existing contracts and iii government budgetary issues and related delays in spending 
likewise  if our actual financial results  or the plans and estimates used in future goodwill impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess for impairment of our goodwill  we could incur future goodwill impairment charges in our transportation systems or other reporting units 
warranty 
we generally provide a one to three year warranty from the original invoice date on all products  materials and workmanship 
defective products are either repaired or replaced  at our option  upon meeting certain criteria 
we accrue a provision for the estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties relating to a product as a component of cost of sales at the time revenue for that product is recognized 
the accrued warranty provision is included within accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
should our actual experience of warranty returns be higher than anticipated  additional warranty reserves may be required  which would adversely affect our product gross profit and our operating results 
income taxes 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be realized  which increases our income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

table of contents on an interim basis  we estimate what our anticipated annual effective tax rate will be  while also separately considering applicable discrete and other non recurring items  and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with this anticipated rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  we refine our estimates based upon actual events and financial results during the year 
this estimation process can result in significant changes to our expected effective tax rate 
when this occurs  we adjust our income tax provision during the quarter in which our estimates are refined so that the year to date provision reflects the expected annual effective tax rate 
these changes  along with adjustments to our deferred taxes  among others  may create fluctuations in our overall effective tax rate from quarter to quarter 
we must review all of our tax positions and make a determination as to whether each position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by regulatory authorities 
if a tax position meets the more likely than not standard  then the related tax benefit is measured based on a cumulative probability analysis of the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement or disposition of the underlying issue 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
stock based compensation 
we record stock based compensation in the statement of income as an expense  based on the estimated grant date fair value of our stock based awards  whereby such fair values are amortized over the requisite service period 
the fair value of our common stock option awards is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing formula 
while utilizing this model meets established requirements  the estimated fair values generated by it may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our common stock option awards as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
our assumptions under the bsm formula include the following i expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our stock price  ii the expected life of options is derived based on the historical life of our options  iii the risk free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury interest rates in effect at the time of grant and iv the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
additionally  we include an estimate of forfeitures in the calculation of stock based compensation expense 
future stock based compensation expense in any particular quarter or year could be affected by changes in our assumptions  changes in market conditions  or to the extent that we grant additional stock based awards 
additionally  if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested stock based awards  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of income data as a percentage of total net sales and contract revenues for the periods indicated 
the following table should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
year ended march  net sales and contract revenues net sales contract revenues total net sales and contract revenues costs of net sales and contract revenues cost of net sales cost of contract revenues gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses operating income non operating income expense other income  net interest expense  net income before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income analysis of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal results of operations net sales and contract revenues 
net sales are comprised of product sales from our roadway sensors and vehicle sensors segments  as well as contract engineering revenue and royalty revenue generated from our vehicle sensors segment 
contract revenues consist entirely of transportation systems contract revenues  which are generated from systems integration and its engineering and consulting services primarily with federal  state  county and municipal agencies 

table of contents the following tables present details of our net sales and contract revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal  and fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal fiscal decrease change in thousands  except percentages roadway sensors vehicle sensors net sales contract revenues total net sales and contract revenues fiscal fiscal increase decrease change in thousands  except percentages roadway sensors vehicle sensors net sales contract revenues total net sales and contract revenues we currently have a diverse customer base with no individual customer representing greater than of our total annual net sales and contract revenues for fiscal  fiscal or fiscal roadway sensors the majority of roadway sensors net sales were derived from sales within north america 
the sequential decreases in roadway sensors net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and likewise fiscal as compared to fiscal  were mainly due to the ongoing effects of reduced and delayed spending on infrastructure projects  in part due to the decline in commercial and residential construction as well as state and local government budgetary pressures  and increased competitors in the market 
while we are cautiously optimistic heading into fiscal  we expect the challenging economic factors discussed above  among others  may continue to adversely impact our roadway sensors net sales for at least the next few fiscal quarters 
vehicle sensors the largest element of vehicle sensors net sales was sales of our ldw systems to the heavy truck market  which aggregated approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal vehicle sensors net sales have sequentially decreased over the last two fiscal years primarily due to the slowdown in our ldw unit shipments to each of our key markets  which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal although we saw an encouraging increase in net sales in the second half of fiscal as compared to the immediately preceding quarters  which resulted primarily from significant sales to one of our us truck fleet customers in the fourth quarter  we cannot assure you that such sales levels from this or other customers will recur in subsequent periods 
we also continue to experience overall softness in our ldw unit sales to the north american truck market and to our european and asian oem customers 
we believe this is driven largely by lower new heavy truck sales in general  as well as the general slowdown in the us and worldwide credit markets and continued weakness and uncertainty in the overall global economy 
we anticipate that vehicle sensors unit sales beyond fiscal could continue to be adversely impacted as a result of the overall decline in sales of heavy trucks globally and by slower than expected adoption rates of our ldw system by european and asian oems and north american heavy truck fleets 
additionally  future unit sales of ldw systems and unit pricing could be adversely impacted as a result of increased competition in this market 
the increase in competition in the current fiscal year contributed to a division of an international heavy truck customer sourcing future primary ldw unit sales to a competitor for a specific geographic region 
also included in vehicle sensors net sales are revenues from contract engineering services and royalty revenues in the passenger car market that are derived from our strategic relationship with valeo  which aggregated approximately  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
we have experienced year over year decreases in contract engineering services provided to valeo as the pertinent engineering development activities have generally reached maturity for the related vehicle platforms that currently incorporate our ldw system 
our ldw systems are currently offered as an option on three infiniti models  with a fourth model expected by the summer of while valeo is promoting our ldw systems to other passenger car oems  we cannot assure you that valeo will be successful in these efforts 

table of contents contract revenues contract revenues are derived from our transportation systems segment and are primarily dependent upon the continued availability of funding at both the state and federal levels from the various departments of transportation 
the decrease in contract revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to delays or reductions in funding for certain of our projects  particularly in the southeast region of the us and in our private planning group  which focuses on private development consulting 
the decrease is also attributable to the timing differences on certain of our larger contracts  which contained a higher amount of sub consultant revenue in fiscal  but such contracts were mostly completed by the end of fiscal and were not replaced with similar such contracts in the current fiscal year 
in the future  we plan to pursue large contracts that may contain significant sub consulting content  which will likely contribute to variability in the timing and amount of our contract revenues from period to period 
during fiscal  we began work on our first two overseas contract awards in abu dhabi and dubai  for which we have recognized contract revenues to date of approximately  we plan to continue to pursue additional international opportunities for our transportation systems segment in the future 
among other factors  we believe the ability of our transportation systems segment to grow and successfully win and service new contracts will be highly dependent upon our continued success in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel 
the fiscal increase in contract revenues  as compared to fiscal  was largely a result of our increased sales and marketing activity across the us  resulting in certain significant new contracts that were awarded to us in fiscal certain of these new contracts contained a higher than usual amount of sub consulting content  which was primarily concentrated in our contract revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal gross profit 
the following tables present details of our gross profit for fiscal compared to fiscal  and fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal fiscal decrease change in thousands  except percentages total gross profit total gross profit as a of total net sales and contract revenues gross profit as a of net sales gross profit as a of contract revenues fiscal fiscal decrease change in thousands  except percentages total gross profit total gross profit as a of total net sales and contract revenues gross profit as a of net sales gross profit as a of contract revenues the decrease in our total gross profit for fiscal as compared to fiscal was generally commensurate with the overall decline in total net sales and contract revenues  as discussed above 
our total gross profit as a percent of total net sales and contract revenues for fiscal increased slightly compared to fiscal primarily due to higher margins from our net sales  particularly roadway sensors  as we realized cost savings due to lower costs of materials driven by improvements in our supply chain management  which we anticipate will continue in the future 
the increase was also attributable  to a lesser extent  to the improvement in our transportation systems margins in fiscal  as discussed further below 
the slight increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to certain materials cost savings  as discussed above  and a favorable customer mix weighted more toward direct sales 
we generally enjoy higher gross margins on direct sales as compared to dealer and aftermarket sales 
the increase was partially offset during the year by decreased gross margins in vehicle sensors  which was largely driven by lower overhead absorption due to the decline in sales  along with an increase in certain estimates for additional excess and obsolete inventory provisions 
the decrease in gross profit as a percent 
table of contents of net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily a result of decreased gross profit in roadway sensors and was largely driven by an unfavorable customer mix weighted more toward dealer than direct sales in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales can fluctuate in any specific quarter or year based on  among other factors  customer and product mix  competitive pricing requirements  product warranty costs and provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  as well as possible shifts of engineering resources from development activities to sustaining activities  which we record as cost of goods sold 
we recognize contract revenues and related gross profit using percentage of completion contract accounting  and the underlying mix of contract activity affects the related gross profit recognized in any given period 
the increase in gross profit as a percent of contract revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a contract mix weighted more toward higher margin contracts in the current fiscal year 
our higher margin contracts often contain a comparatively lower proportion of sub consulting revenues associated with them 
conversely  a larger portion of our fiscal contract revenues contained higher sub consulting content  as compared to fiscal  and thus contributed to overall lower margins 
particularly  we experienced an abnormally high level of sub consulting content related to certain new contracts during the fourth quarter of fiscal  which contributed both to the overall increase in contract revenues and a decrease in our gross profit 
in the near term  we expect our sub consulting content as a percentage of total contract revenues to be generally in line with those experienced in fiscal  however  due to the variability and timing of our contracts  it has become increasingly difficult to accurately predict the sub consulting content in our transportation systems contracts in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expense the following table presents selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal and fiscal fiscal fiscal of net of net sales and sales and contract contract increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilities  insurance and supplies travel and conferences professional and outside services other selling  general and administrative the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to i our overall reduction in headcount from march   ii lower accruals for bonuses and other incentive compensation primarily due to lower sales and operating profit in the current fiscal year  and iii the suspension of our matching contributions under our k plan effective july  we also reduced our professional and outside services expenses during the current fiscal year primarily through our efforts to conserve costs and scale back our usage of such services  along with various efficiencies gained in our internal control assessment and other financial reporting obligations 
in fiscal  we are currently scheduled to be subject to the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  which we expect will increase our professional and outside services expenses 

table of contents the following table presents selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal and fiscal fiscal of net of net sales and sales and contract contract increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilities  insurance and supplies travel and conferences professional and outside services other selling  general and administrative the overall increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily driven by higher selling expenses in our transportation systems segment as a result of a shift in certain of our labor resources from project related activities to sales and marketing efforts  aimed at capturing additional contract backlog 
this resulted in an increase in this segment s sales and marketing expenses to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal our professional and outside services expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to our efforts to conserve costs and scale back our usage of certain outside and professional services  as well as various efficiencies gained in our internal control assessment and other financial reporting obligations in that year 
research and development expense the following table presents research and development expense for fiscal and fiscal fiscal fiscal of net of net sales and sales and contract contract amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilties  development and supplies other research and development the decrease in research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower overall engineering headcount and a more efficient engineering structure as we shifted our focus to new product development from a historical focus on new customer qualification and manufacturing support 
we believe research and development activities are crucial to our ability to continue to be a leader in our markets 
for competitive reasons  we closely guard the confidentiality of specific development projects 
we currently expect our total research and development expenditures for fiscal to be slightly higher in absolute dollars than those for fiscal 
table of contents the following table presents research and development expense for fiscal and fiscal fiscal of net of net sales and sales and contract contract increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilties  development and supplies other research and development the increase in research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased research and development activities in roadway sensors aimed at accelerating the time to market of certain new products which were introduced in fiscal other income  net other income  net in fiscal was  and primarily consisted of foreign currency transaction gains and the net decrease in the fair value of certain outstanding warrants 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report  for additional discussion regarding the fair value of our warrants 
other income  net in fiscal was  and includes the net gain of  that we recognized in connection with the early retirement of certain of our convertible debentures  as well as net foreign currency transaction gains and other miscellaneous income 
other income  net in fiscal was  and primarily reflected the net gain of  we recognized in connection with the early retirement of certain convertible debentures 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the retirement of our convertible debentures 
interest expense  net net interest expense was   and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the sequential decreases were primarily due to our lower overall level of borrowings and lower interest rates in the current years 
income taxes the following table presents our benefit provision for income taxes for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal year ended march  in thousands  except percentages benefit provision for income taxes effective tax rate our effective tax rate for fiscal was favorably impacted primarily by the recognition of approximately  of unrecognized tax benefits during the year due to the expiration of certain federal and state statutes in various jurisdictions 
the income tax benefits recorded in fiscal and fiscal were primarily the result of a decrease in the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets as a result of changes in estimates of the future realizability of these assets 
as we update our estimates in future periods  adjustments to our deferred tax asset and valuation allowance may be necessary 
we anticipate this will cause our future overall effective tax rate in any given period to fluctuate from prior effective tax rates and statutory tax rates 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including  but not limited to  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 

table of contents at march   we had million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in and  respectively 
due to changes in stock ownership  our federal net operating loss carryforwards and other federal attributes are subject to a section annual limitation 
although the impact cannot be precisely determined at this time  we believe that our net operating loss carryforwards will cause us to have future income tax payments that are substantially lower than the income tax liability calculated using statutory tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows we have historically financed our operations with a combination of cash flows from operations  borrowings under credit facilities and the sale of equity securities 
we currently rely on cash flows from operations and the availability of borrowings on a line of credit facility to fund our operations  which we believe to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional capital to fund potential future acquisitions and our future growth 
we may raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentage of existing stockholders would likely be reduced 
at march   we had million in working capital  which included no borrowings on our million line of credit and million in cash and cash equivalents 
this compares to working capital of million at march   which included no borrowings on our line of credit and million in cash and cash equivalents 
the following table summarizes our cash flows for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal year ended march  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
cash provided by our operations in fiscal was primarily the result of i our fiscal net income of million  ii million in non cash items within the statement of income  primarily consisting of adjustments to our deferred tax assets of million  depreciation expense of  and stock based compensation expense of  and iii million in cash resulting from changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the year 
our net accounts receivable decreased approximately million from march  to march  due in part to our lower net sales and contract revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal levels 
during the current fiscal year  we have also generally been successful in collecting our outstanding receivables within our expected payment terms 
in the future  our accounts receivable could increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant extended payment terms to customers  both of which are more likely to occur during challenging economic times when our customers may face issues gaining sufficient credit on a timely basis or on acceptable terms 
inventories decreased approximately million from march  to march  as we worked through higher inventory levels on hand as of march   which were partially due to the introduction of new roadway sensors products and the acquisition of various components that were discontinued by the manufacturer 
during the current fiscal year  we have also focused on reducing our inventory purchases to reflect the overall reduction in our net sales and the ongoing economic slowdown 
in the future  our inventory levels are likely to continue to be determined based upon  among other factors  the level of purchase orders we receive from our customers  the stage at which our products are in their respective product life cycles  and competitive situations in the marketplace 
we attempt to balance such considerations against risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
accounts payable decreased approximately million from march  to march  largely due to the decrease in inventory purchases throughout fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the general timing of inventory and other purchases and vendor payments also contributed to the year over year decrease in our accounts payable

interest on borrowed amounts under the revolving line of credit are payable monthly at a rate equal to the current stated prime rate at march  up to the current stated prime rate plus  depending on aggregate deposit balances maintained at the bank in relation to the total loan commitment under the credit facility 
we are obligated to pay an unused line fee of per annum applied to the average unused portion of the revolving line of credit during the preceding month 
the revolving line of credit does not contain any early termination fees and is secured by substantially all of our assets

in this event  we cannot assure you that we would be able to quickly obtain equivalent or suitable replacement financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we were not able to secure alternative sources of financing  such acceleration would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition
