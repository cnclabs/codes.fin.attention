item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  which are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under risk factors or in other parts of this form k 
overview we develop  market and sell network based platforms that enable cable multiple system operators msos and telecommunications companies collectively  service providers to offer video services across coaxial  fiber and copper networks 
we were incorporated in delaware in december since that time  we have developed significant expertise in rich media processing  communications networking and bandwidth management 
our customers are using our platforms to expand high definition television hdtv services  and ensure high quality video advertising programming to subscribers 
our broadcast video  telcotv  switched digital video and iptv personalized video solutions are comprised of a combination of software and programmable hardware platforms 
we have sold our solutions to more than customers globally 
we sell our products and services to customers in the us and canada through our direct sales force 
we sell to customers internationally through a combination of direct sales and resellers 
our domestic customers include bright house  cablevision  charter  comcast  cox  time warner cable and verizon  which are seven of the ten largest service providers in the us our largest international resellers include guangdong tongke  sugys and ssangyong 
our sales cycle typically ranges from six to months  but can be longer if the sale relates to new product introductions 
our sales process generally involves several stages before we can recognize revenues on the sale of our products 
as a provider of advanced technologies  we seek to actively participate with our existing and potential customers in the evaluation of their technology needs and network architectures  including the development of initial designs and prototypes 
following these activities  we typically respond to a service provider s request for proposal  configure our products to work within our customer s network architecture  and test our products first in laboratory testing and then in field environments to ensure interoperability with existing products in the service provider s network 
following testing  our revenue recognition generally depends on satisfying the acceptance criteria specified in our contract with the customer and our customer s schedule for roll out of the product 
completion of several of these stages is substantially outside of our control  which causes our revenue patterns from a given customer to vary widely from period to period 
after initial deployment of our products  subsequent purchases of our products typically have a more compressed sales cycle 
due to the nature of the cable and telecommunications industries  we sell our products to a limited number of large customers 
for the years ended december   and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our net revenues from our top five customers 
we believe that for the foreseeable future our net revenues will continue to be highly concentrated in a limited number of large customers 
the loss of one or more of our large customers  or the cancellation or deferral of purchases by one or more of these customers  would have a material adverse impact on our revenues and operating results 
net revenues 
we derive our net revenues principally from sales of  and services for video solutions  with a minimal remaining contribution from our data products  which we retired in october our product revenues are comprised of a combination of software licenses and programmable hardware platforms 
our product revenues are influenced by a variety of factors  including the level and timing of capital spending by our customers and the annual budgetary cycles of  and the timing and amount of orders from  significant customers 
the selling prices of our products vary based upon the particular customer implementation  which impacts the relative mix of software  hardware and services associated with the sale 
to date  our products primarily include broadcast video  telcotv and switched digital video 
our service revenues include ongoing customer support and maintenance  product installation and training 
our customer support and maintenance is available in a tiered offering at either a standard or an enhanced level 
the majority of our customers have purchased our enhanced level of customer support and maintenance 
the accounting 
table of contents for revenues is complex  and we account for revenues in accordance with applicable us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
cost of net revenues 
our cost of product revenues consists primarily of payments for components and product assembly  costs of product testing  provisions recorded for excess and obsolete inventory  provisions recorded for warranty obligations  manufacturing overhead and allocated facilities and information technology expense 
cost of service revenues is primarily comprised of personnel costs in providing technical support  costs incurred to support deployment and installation within our customers networks  training costs and allocated facilities and information technology expense 
headcount in these functions was employees as of december  compared to employees as of december  we project headcount in services and manufacturing operations will continue to remain relatively flat in the near term 
gross margin 
our gross profit as a percentage of net revenues  or gross margin  has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of software  hardware and services sold  and the average selling prices of our products 
we achieve a higher gross margin on the software content of our products compared to the hardware content 
in general  we continue to experience competitive pricing pressures on our products and we expect the average selling prices of our products to decline compared to the year ended december  our gross margins for products are also influenced by the specific terms of our contracts  which may vary significantly from customer to customer based on the type of products sold  the overall size of the customer s order  and the architecture of the customer network  which can influence the amount and complexity of design  integration and installation services 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses consist of research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative  restructuring and other charges 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of our operating expenses 
we project our headcount will grow modestly in the near term  primarily in engineering and sales  to support new product initiatives and to expand our international reseller network 
research and development expense is the largest functional component of our operating expenses and consists primarily of personnel costs  independent contractor costs  prototype expenses  and other allocated facilities and information technology expense 
the majority of our research and development staff is focused on software development 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
our development teams are located in tel aviv  israel  shenzhen  peoples republic of china  westborough  massachusetts and redwood city  california 
due to the long term opportunities that we see for our business  we are accelerating certain technology projects 
accordingly  we expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in the near term  due to new product initiatives in key strategic areas for both new and existing products 
sales and marketing expense relates primarily to compensation and associated costs for marketing and sales personnel  sales commissions  promotional and other marketing expenses  travel  trade show expenses and allocated facilities and information technology expense 
marketing programs are intended to generate revenues from new and existing customers and are expensed as incurred 
we expect sales and marketing expense to grow modestly in absolute dollars in the near term  primarily to expand our international reseller network 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for general and administrative personnel  professional services and allocated facilities and information technology expenses 
professional services consist of outside legal  accounting and other consulting costs 
we expect that general and administrative expense will increase modestly in absolute dollars in the near term  to support a modest growth in headcount both in the us and abroad as well as a modest projected increase in professional expenses 
class action litigation charges are settlement fees and expenses  related to a series of purported shareholder class action lawsuits against our officers  our directors and the underwriters of our initial public offering 
in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc contingencies  we recorded an expense of million for the year ended december   and an additional expense of million for the year ended december  these lawsuits were settled or dismissed as of december   and hence we have no further obligations 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable periods 
management bases its estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  which  in turn  could change the results from those reported 
our management evaluates its estimates  assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis 
the critical accounting policies requiring estimates  assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition our software and hardware are sold as solutions and our software is a significant component of our solutions 
we provide unspecified software updates and enhancements related to products through support contracts 
with respect to certain transactions and for all transactions involving the sale of products with a significant software component  revenue is recognized when all of the following have occurred we have entered into an arrangement with a customer  delivery has occurred  customer payment is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
product revenues consist of sales of our software and hardware products 
software product sales include a perpetual license to our software 
we recognize product revenues upon shipment to our customers  including channel partners  on non cancellable contracts and purchase orders when all revenue recognition criteria are met  or  if specified in an agreement  upon receipt of final acceptance of the product  provided all other criteria are met 
end users and channel partners generally have no rights of return  stock rotation rights or price protection 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenues and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenues 
substantially all of our product sales have been made in combination with support services  which consist of software updates and customer support 
our customer service agreements allow customers to select from plans offering various levels of technical support  unspecified software upgrades and enhancements on an if and when available basis 
revenues for support services are recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term  which is typically one year but can extend to five years for our telecommunications customers 
revenues from other services  such as installation  program management and training  are recognized when the services are performed 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues when a customer agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenues 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occur or when fair value can be established 
when the undelivered element is customer support and there is no evidence of fair value for this support  revenue for the entire arrangement is bundled and revenue is recognized ratably over the service period 
vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately 
fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of an arrangement based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
in the event payment terms are greater than days  the fees are deemed not to be fixed or determinable and revenues are recognized when the payments become due  provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
deferred revenues consist primarily of deferred service fees including customer support and professional services such as installation  program management and training and product revenues  net of the associated costs 
deferred product revenue generally relates to acceptance provisions that have not been met or partial shipment or 
table of contents when we do not have vsoe of fair value on the undelivered items 
when deferred revenues are recognized as revenues  the associated deferred costs are also recognized as cost of net revenues 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including the credit worthiness of the customer and the past transaction history of the customer 
if the customer is not deemed credit worthy  all revenues are deferred from the arrangement until payment is received and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
inventories  net inventories  net consist primarily of finished goods and are stated at the lower of standard cost or market 
standard cost approximates actual cost on the first in  first out method 
we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record write downs for excess and obsolete inventories based on our estimate of demand for our products  potential obsolescence of technology  product life cycles and whether pricing trends or forecasts indicate that the carrying value of inventory exceeds its estimated selling price 
these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions  technology changes  and new product introductions and require estimates that may include elements that are uncertain 
actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and may have a material effect on gross margins 
if inventory is written down  a new cost basis is established that cannot be increased in future periods 
warranty liabilities we provide a warranty for our software and hardware products 
in most cases  we warrant that our hardware will be free of defects in workmanship for one year and that our software media will be free of defects for days 
in master purchase agreements with large customers  however  we often warrant that both our hardware and software products will function in material conformance to specifications for a period ranging from one to five years from the date of shipment 
in general  we accrue for warranty claims based on the company s historical claims experience 
in addition  we accrue for warranty claims based on specific events and other factors when we believes an exposure is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the adequacy of the accrual is reviewed on a periodic basis and adjusted  if necessary  based on additional information as it becomes available 
stock based compensation we apply the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of asc compensation stock compensation asc 
stock based compensation is recorded at fair value as of the grant date and recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period  which we have elected to amortize on a straight line basis 
under asc  we estimate the fair value of stock option awards using a black scholes option pricing formula and a single option award approach 
this model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that  at the date of grant  we use the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of the price of our common stock  risk free interest rates and expected dividend yield of our common stock 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
options typically vest with respect to of the shares one year after the options vesting commencement date and the remainder ratably on a monthly basis over the following three years 
in valuing share based awards under asc  significant judgment is required in determining the expected volatility of our common stock and the expected term individuals will hold their share based awards prior to exercising 
the computation of expected volatility is derived primarily from the weighted historical volatilities of several comparable companies within the cable and telecommunications equipment industry and to a lesser extent  our weighted historical volatility following our ipo in march the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and was calculated using the simplified method permitted by sec staff accounting bulletin sab as revised by sab in the future  as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock and the actual term employees hold our options  expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant date fair value of future awards of stock options and ultimately the expense we record 

table of contents restricted stock units rsu grants under the plan generally vest in increments over two to four years from the date of grant 
the rsus are classified as equity awards because the rsus are paid only in shares upon vesting 
rsu awards are measured at the fair value at the date of grant  which corresponds to the closing stock price of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the rsus  which is generally the vesting period 
impairment of long lived assets we assess impairment of long lived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  or current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
recoverability is assessed based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value  which is determined on a discounted cash flow basis 
we make estimates and judgments about future undiscounted cash flows and fair value 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans  there is significant exercise of judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a long lived asset over its estimated remaining useful life 
our estimates of anticipated future cash flows could be reduced significantly in the future 
as a result  the carrying amount of our long lived assets could be reduced through impairment charges in the future 
accounting for income taxes we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our consolidated balance sheets 
in general  deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be realized when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or credit and net loss carry forwards are utilized 
accordingly  realization of our deferred tax assets depends on future taxable income against which these deductions  losses and credits can be utilized 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance  thereby reducing the carrying value of deferred tax assets 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we recorded a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets arising from us operations 
based on the available evidence  we believed it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize all of these deferred tax assets in the future 
we intend to maintain the full valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets until sufficient evidence exists to support its reversal 
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
the us congress enacted the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of the act on november  creating an opportunity for us to elect to carry back either a or federal net operating loss nol for three  four  or five years 
the act also suspended the ninety percent limitation on the utilization of alternative minimum tax amt losses  effectively permitting us to elect to carry back our entire applicable nol 
this act favorably impacted our effective tax rate

the increase was primarily due to a million recognition of service revenues from decommissioned analog technology as described below  a million increase in video customer support and maintenance revenues from our new and installed base of customers and a million increase in video installation and training revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in customer support and maintenance revenues from our retired cmts platform products 
in an effort to switch to all digital broadcasting  the us federal government set june  as the final date for full power television stations that broadcasted in analog to convert to digital only 
previously  we sold analog products to a large telcotv customer that allowed analog transmission of video over fiber optic lines 
as part of its compliance with the move to all digital  this customer completed the decommissioning of the analog technology products from its network and migrated to an all digital format

table of contents longer deemed to be highly effective  resulting in the ineffective portion of the gain on these derivatives of million being recognized in other income expense  net in other income expense  net included a million charge from fair value adjustments of preferred stock warrants in upon the completion of our initial public offering on march   the warrants to purchase redeemable convertible preferred stock became warrants to purchase our common stock and accordingly we ceased adjusting these warrants for changes in fair value and reclassified their respective liabilities to stockholders equity 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes of million and million for and  respectively  were related to provisions for both domestic and foreign income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes of million and million  respectively 
we use the with and without approach described in guidance which has been incorporated into asc to determine the recognition and measurement of excess tax benefits 
accordingly  we elected to recognize excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in additional paid in capital  once realized 
in addition  we elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock based compensation awards or other tax attributes  such as research and development credits and alternative minimum tax credits  in our consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   the portion of the federal and state operating loss carry forwards  which related to stock option benefits  was million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carry forwards of million and state research and development tax credit carry forwards of million 
if not utilized  the federal net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards will expire between and  and the state net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards will expire in different years depending on the specific state  ranging from to indefinite 
utilization of these net operating losses and credit carry forwards are subject to an annual limitation due to the provisions of section of the internal revenue code 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private and public sales of equity securities and from cash provided by operations 
as of december   we had no long term debt outstanding 
cash flow cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities as of december  marketable securities consist principally of corporate debt securities  commercial paper and securities of us agencies with remaining time to maturity of two years or less 
restricted cash of million as of december  was not included in cash and cash equivalents 
operating activities the key line items affecting cash from operating activities were as follows in thousands years ended december  net loss income add back non cash charges net income before non cash charges decrease in accounts receivable decrease in inventories  net decrease increase in deferred revenues decrease in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities other  net net cash provided by operating activities 
table of contents non cash charges primarily related to stock based compensation and depreciation of property and equipment  and for revaluation of warrant liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased in compared to primarily due to the net loss in compared to net income in this net cash provided from operating activities was offset in primarily due to decreased deferred revenues in and net cash provided from operating activities increased in compared to primarily due to net income in compared to a net loss in this net cash provided from operating activities was offset in primarily due to decreased deferred revenues in compared to increased deferred revenues in we expect cash from operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter  accounts receivable collections  inventory and supply chain management and the timing and amount of taxes and other payments 
investing activities our investing activities used cash of million for  primarily from net purchases of marketable securities of million  the purchase of property and equipment  primarily computer and engineering equipment of million  and the purchase of a software license for million 
our investing activities used cash of million for  primarily from net purchases of marketable securities of million and the purchase of property and equipment of million primarily to support our new product offerings 
these capital expenditures consisted primarily of computer and test equipment and software purchases  offset in part by million in proceeds from the sale of intangible assets for our fast flow technology 
our investing activities used cash of million for  primarily from net purchases of marketable securities of million and the purchase of property and equipment of million primarily to support our new product offerings 
these capital expenditures consisted primarily of computer and test equipment and software purchases 
financing activities our financing activities provided cash from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options under our equity incentive plans and sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plan of million for our financing activities provided cash of million for  primarily from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of options under our equity incentive plans and sales of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
our financing activities provided cash of million for  primarily from our ipo  which provided us with aggregate net proceeds of million and proceeds of million  primarily from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of options under our equity incentive plans and sales under our employee stock purchase plan 
these increases were partially offset by the repayment of loans and capital leases of million 
liquidity and capital resource requirements we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  the networking industry is capital intensive 
in order to remain competitive  we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in products and in research and development 
we may seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our product lines or research and development efforts  or for other strategic purposes such as significant acquisitions 
the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our products  changes in industry conditions  product mix  competitive factors and the timing of any strategic acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations as of december  were as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than total one year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total obligations operating lease obligations are net of sublease rentals from a portion of our tel aviv facility 
purchase obligations comprise firm non cancelable agreements to purchase inventory 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of the securities and exchange commission s regulation s k 
effects of inflation our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash  marketable securities and receivables  are not significantly affected by inflation because they are short term in duration 
our non monetary assets  consisting primarily of inventory  intangible assets  goodwill and prepaid expenses and other assets  are not affected significantly by inflation 
we believe that the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our cost of goods sold and operating expenses  such as those for employee compensation  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of the products and services offered by us 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k for recent accounting pronouncements that could have an effect on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without exposing us to significant risk of loss 
the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of our investment to fluctuate 
to control this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is not limited to our investment portfolio 
as of december   our investments were primarily in commercial paper  corporate notes and bonds  money market funds and us government and agency securities 
if overall interest rates fell for the year ended december   our interest income would have decreased by an immaterial amount  assuming consistent investment levels 
foreign currency risk our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars  and therefore the majority of our revenues are not subject to foreign currency risk 
however  if we extend credit to international customers and the us dollar appreciates against our customers local currency there is an increased collection risk as it will require more local currency to settle our us dollar based invoice 
our operating expense and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the israeli new shekel  and to a lesser extent the chinese yuan and euro 
to protect against significant fluctuations in value and the volatility of future cash flows 
table of contents caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we have foreign currency risk management programs to hedge both balance sheet items and future forecasted expenses denominated in israeli new shekels 
an adverse change in exchange rates of for the israeli new shekel  chinese yuan and euro  without any hedging  would have resulted in an increase in our loss before taxes of approximately million for the year ended december  we continue to hedge our projected exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the israeli new shekel  and accordingly we do not anticipate that fluctuations will have a material impact on our financial results for the year ending december  currency forward contracts and currency options are generally utilized in these hedging programs 
our hedging programs are intended to reduce  but not eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
as our hedging program is relatively short term in nature  a long term material change in the value of the us dollar versus the israeli new shekel could adversely impact our operating expenses in the future
