the company believes  that subject to receipt of adequate financing  revenues from these products will significantly increase in due to the creation of distribution agreements that are anticipated to move the ivd cancer diagnostic test kits and the elleuxe brand of skin care products into broad commercial channels in markets throughout the world 
however  the success of the company s distribution strategy for these products in is dependent upon a number of factors including the company obtaining adequate financing in if the company is unable to raise sufficient funds  the company s distribution strategy may not be able to be implemented at the rate the company anticipates which will have a material adverse effect on anticipated revenues

because the onko sure tm test kit is a non invasive blood test  there are no side effects of the administration of the test 
as with other cancer diagnostic products  false positive and false negative test results could pose a small risk to patient health if the physician is not vigilant in following up on the onko sure tm test kit results with other clinically relevant diagnostic modalities 
while the onko sure tm test kit is helpful in diagnosing whether a patient has cancer  the attending physician needs to use other testing methods to determine and confirm the type and kind of cancer involved

com china based integrated pharmaceuticals china pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution  discontinued operations and dispositions the company s previously operated china based pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution business is engaged in the manufacture and distribution of generic and homeopathic pharmaceutical products and supplements  as well as cosmetic products 
rpc operated this business division through it s wholly owned subsidiary  jpi  which in turn  operates through a wholly owned chinese subsidiary  jiangxi jiezhong bio chemical pharmacy company limited jjb 
on january   the company s board of directors authorized management to sell the operations of yangbian yiqiao bio chemical pharmacy company limited yyb yyb 
the company classified the assets  liabilities  operations and cash flows of yyb as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the sale of yyb was completed in june shares in yyb along with rights to certain land and land use rights were transferred to the buyer an individual in consideration of the forgiveness of amounts owed to yyb from jjb  and the buyer of yyb has contractually agreed to pay off the balance of the million rmb obligation secured by a mortgage on certain land owned by jjb 
yyb 
yyb has been accounted for as discontinued operations and in connection with the sale of yyb jpi transferred certain of jjb s land use rights to the buyer of yyb  in which the bank has a secured interest 
jpi originally acquired yyb and jjb in along with certain assets and liabilities of a predecessor to jjb jiangxi shangrao kangda biochemical pharmacy co 
ltd 
yyb was sold to a chinese national for million rmb or  us dollars in the form of an agreement whereby the buyer of yyb will pay this amount to chinese international bank of commerce in order to partially satisfy outstanding bank loans at jjb 
during the second quarter of  the company s management became aware of internal management disputes in china that resulted in a deterioration of both operational and financial controls by jpi s management over the operating entity jjb 
the management of both jpi and jjb have indicated that they believe the most prudent 
table of contents path to raising additional capital for the company s chinese operating division is for jjb to complete one or more private placements of equity during the fourth quarter of they also indicated that they believe the best path for the company to monetize the company s investments in jpi and jjb would be for jjb to seek a public listing on the growth enterprise market gem located in hong kong or a similar asia based market by the third quarter of the company s executive management and board of directors are in agreement with jpi and jjb s management on this spin off strategy and are working with jpi and jjb to seek to complete their plans that are currently under development and designed to provide a path for a potential financial return for the company in the future from this business unit 
during the third quarter of  it became apparent to the company s management that the working relationship with management of its operations in china was becoming increasingly strained 
accordingly  the company deemed it appropriate to seek alternative means of monetizing its investment 
there were several issues that caused the company to conclude accordingly  including  but not limited to non responsiveness by the management in china to requests by company management for financial information  non responsiveness by management in china to requests for transfer of company funds to bank accounts under corporate control  lack of timely communication with corporate management concerning significant decisions made by management in china concerning the disposal of the yyb subsidiary  and lack of timely communication with corporate officers concerning operations in china 
effective september   based on unanimous consent of the company s board of directors and an executed binding agreement the agreement between the company and henry jia  frank zheng and yuan da xia collectively  the jpi shareholders  the company deconsolidated all activity of jpi 
based on the agreement and in accordance with current accounting guidelines  the company deconsolidated jpi as of the date the company ceased to have a controlling financial interest  which was effective september  in accordance with the agreement  the company exchanged its shares of jpi for non voting shares of preferred stock  relinquished all rights to past and future profits  surrendered its management positions and agreed to non authoritative minority role on its board of directors 
based on the company s evaluation of current accounting guidance  it was determined that the company did not maintain significant influence over the investee and  accordingly  has recorded such investment in accordance with the cost method 
although  the company maintains significant economic ownership in jpi  based on its evaluation of its lack of ability to influence  lack of a role in policy and decision making  no significant planned intercompany activity  among other things  the company concluded that it would not be appropriate to account for such investment in consolidation or under the equity method of accounting 
the deconsolidation process of jpi and jjb materially and adversely affected the company s earnings and sales 
there can be no assurance that we will ever realize any significant value from the company s equity interest in jpi and jjb 
despite the on going deconsolidation of jpi and jjb started on september   the company still believes jpi and jjb have a promising future 
the company anticipates that they may be able to sell off a portion or all of their ownership in jpi and jjb during the next months  alternatively the company would seek an exit from their 
table of contents investment at or after any public listing 
the company also could retain all or a portion of the company s remaining equity stake in jpi and jjb  if ownership continues to look promising 
the goal is to gain the best valuation possible for this strategic asset 
additionally  the company also believes that jpi jjb s business and brand recognition make it a potential buyout target 
on september   the company entered into an agreement which outlines the company s limited role in jpi s future operations 
as such  the company has classified jpi on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as investment in jpi and included results from jjb s operations for the period ended september  on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
operations of jjb jjb manufactures and markets numerous diagnostic  pharmaceutical  nutritional supplement and cosmetic products

historically  the top selling products in china are hpe based solutions anti aging cosmecutical  domperidone anti emetic  levofloxacin lactate injections iv antibiotics and glucose solutions pharmaceutical 
facilities the sfda requires that all facilities engaged in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products obtain gmp certification 
in february  jjb s gmp certification expired for the small volume parenteral solutions injection plant lines that were engaged in manufacturing the company s hpe injectible product  goodnak  and all other small volume parenteral solutions 
jjb ceased small volume parenteral solutions operations at this facility while undertaking million in modifications necessary to bring the facility and its operations into compliance 
the renovations are complete and jjb resumed operation of the parenteral small injectible lines in the second quarter of the company was notified by the chinese military department of its intent to annex one of jjb s plants that is located near a military installation 
the proposed area to be annexed contains the facilities that are used to manufacture large and small volume parenteral solutions  including the production lines for which the company is attempting to obtain gmp certification 
discussions regarding annexation are proceeding and we expect that jjb will be compensated fairly for the transfer of the facility upon annexation 
jjb intends to find a new single center site in jiangxi province  china to relocate its operations 
for purposes of reporting the results of discontinued operations  the company have assumed that all products previously manufactured and sold by yyb were sold with the business 
the company may have to spend significant time and resources finding  building and equipping the new location and restarting the relocated operations 
in addition  such new facilities will need to obtain gmp certification for all manufacturing operations 
marketing and distribution jjb has established a marketing program consisting of approximately forty sales managers and a network of distributors who market jjb s products 

table of contents jjb sells directly to hospitals and retail stores and indirectly to other customers through distributors 
one primary distributor has retail outlets throughout china 
jjb is developing educational programs for hospitals  doctors  clinics and distributors with respect to jjb s product lines 
these educational programs are intended to improve sales and promotion of jjb s products 
new beauty formulations of the hpe based anti aging product during  jjb finalized the formulations of the following hpe based cosmetic products 
these new products consist of capsules and an easy to apply lotion version and are marketed under the trade name nalefen skin care 
these new products complement jjb s existing high quality injectible and extract formulations 
additionally  jjb has contracted with yibo to develop a capsule version of the goodnak product 
jjb plans to sell both products through both new and existing distribution channels within the henan  sichuan  guizhou  shanxi  xinjiang  gansu  hunan  zhejiang  fujian  liaoning and heilongjiang provinces of china 
together these regions have a combined population of more than million people 
distribution channels for beauty product lines distribution contracts which were in place during for the sale of hpe products have expired and jjb has not renewed the agreements 
as a result  revenue in was adversely impacted 
at this time  jjb does not anticipate the new lotion formulations will also be sold through these same distributors 
jpi s management has indicated that they have developed various new distribution relationships with more reliable distributors that will be selling their hpe solutions in the future 
however  in addition to china  jjb believes that some of the beauty products will be good candidates for export to the north american and south american markets 
jjb has completed the reformulation of the china based formula and will submit to a us laboratory to be tested for safety and effectiveness 
in conjunction with the testing  rpc is collaborating with an industry specialist to develop a unique packaging scheme for the market 
it is estimated that this process will be completed in the current chinese economic and market environment the company operates in a challenging economic and regulatory environment that has undergone significant changes in technology and in patterns of global trade 
the current economic and market environment in china is uncertain 
in addition  china s health care spending is projected to increase by nearly to billion  with a government proposal to bring universal healthcare to of its billion citizens by  as reported by the american free press 
while this data appears promising  the proposal  however  could result in additional controls over the pricing of certain drugs which could  in turn  negatively impact jjb s business prospects in china and the carrying amount of production rights acquired from yibo

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

table of contents actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and the differences could be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements inventories 
major components of inventories are raw materials  packaging materials  direct labor and production overhead 
the company s inventories consist primarily of raw materials and related materials  and are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first in  first out fifo basis 
the company regularly monitors inventories for excess or obsolete items and makes any valuation corrections when such adjustments are needed 
once established  write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the obsolete or excess inventories 
the company writes down inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  future pricing and market conditions 
if actual future demand  future pricing or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required and the differences could be material 
such differences might significantly impact cash flows from operating activities 
sales allowances 
a portion of the company s business is to sell products to distributors who resell the products to end customers 
in certain instances  these distributors obtain discounts based on the contractual terms of these arrangements 
sales discounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases or by reference to a specific price in the related distribution agreement 
the company recognizes the amount of these discounts at the time the sale is recognized 
additionally  sales returns allowances are estimated based on historical return data  and recorded at the time of sale 
if the quality or efficacy of the company s products deteriorates or market conditions otherwise change  actual discounts and returns could be significantly higher than estimated  resulting in potentially material differences in cash flows from operating activities 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification of customer accounts and our best estimate of the likelihood of potential loss  taking into account such factors as the financial condition and payment history of major customers 
we evaluate the collectibility of our receivables at least quarterly 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the differences could be material and could significantly impact cash flows from operating activities 
valuation of intangible assets 
the company evaluates the carrying value of its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable 
the company uses its best judgment based on the current facts and circumstances relating to its business when determining whether any significant impairment factors exist 
the company considers the following factors or conditions  among others  that could indicate the need for an impairment review significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  market projections for cancer research technology  its ability to obtain patents  including continuation patents  on technology  significant changes in its strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  including legal factors  potential for strategic partnerships for the development of its patented technology  and changing or implementation of rules regarding sale of pharmaceuticals in china 
if the company determines that the carrying values of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company s management performs an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if impairment exists 
if impairment exists  the company measures the impairment based on the difference between the asset s carrying amount and its fair value  and the impairment is 
table of contents charged to operations in the period in which the long lived asset impairment is determined by management 
based on its analysis  the company believes that no indicators of impairment of the carrying value of its long lived assets existed at december  there can be no assurance  however  that market conditions will not change or demand for the company s products will continue or allow the company to realize the value of its technologies and prevent future long lived asset impairment 
revenue recognition 
revenues from the wholesale sales of over the counter and prescription pharmaceuticals are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the buyer  the price is fixed or readily determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
in conjunction with the launch of the company s nalefen skin care hpe products  distributors of the products were offered limited time discounts to allow for promotional expenses incurred in the distribution channel 
distributors are not required to submit proof of the promotional expenses incurred 
these promotional discounts are netted against revenues in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
accounts receivable presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance have been reduced by the promotional discounts  as customers are permitted by the terms of the distribution contracts to net the discounts against payments on the related invoices 
any provision for sales promotion discounts and estimated returns are accounted for in the period the related sales are recorded 
buyers generally have limited rights of return and the company provides for estimated returns at the time of sale based on historical experience 
returns from customers historically have not been material 
actual returns and claims in any future period may differ from the company s estimates 
deferred taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered estimated future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount needed for the valuation allowance 
based on these estimates  all of the company s deferred tax assets have been reserved 
if actual results differ favorably from those estimates used  the company may be able to realize all or part of the company s net deferred tax assets 
such realization could positively impact the company s consolidated operating results and cash flows from operating activities 
litigation 
the company accounts for litigation losses in accordance with gaap  loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management s best estimate of a loss  or when a best estimate cannot be made  a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than when the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information is known 
accordingly  the company is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  therefore  the minimum amount  which could be zero  is recorded 
as information becomes known  either the minimum loss amount is increased or a best estimate can be made  resulting in additional loss provisions 
occasionally  a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 
due to the nature of current litigation matters  the factors that could lead to changes in loss reserves might change quickly and the range of actual losses could be significant  which could materially impact the company s consolidated results of operations and comprehensive loss and cash flows from operating activities 
stock based compensation expense 
all issuances of the company s common stock for non cash consideration have been assigned a per share amount equaling either the market value of the shares issued or the value of consideration received  whichever is more readily determinable 
the majority of non cash consideration received pertains to services rendered by consultants and others and has been valued at the market value of the shares on the measurement date 
the company accounts for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services in accordance with gaap 
the measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or ii the date at which the consultant or vendor s performance is complete 
in the case of equity instruments issued to consultants  the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement 

table of contents the company accounts for equity awards issued to employees as follows 
gaap requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  including stock options  based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize the portion expected to vest as compensation expense over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  usually the vesting period 
derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value

the company cannot assure that this anti fibrinogen hrp replacement will be completed 
an integral part of the company s research and development through is the testing and development of an improved version of the onko sure tm test kit 
the company is reviewing various alternatives and believes that a replacement anti fibrinogen hrp will be identified  tested and usfda approved before the current supply is exhausted 
pilot studies show that the new version could be superior to the current version 
it is anticipated that this version will be submitted to the usfda in the latter half of china wholesale china net revenues were  for the twelve months ended december  as compared to  for the same period in this decrease was primarily due to management conflicts between jpi and its subsidiary jjb  the sale of yyb  and the lack of sales of hpe solutions due to the mandatory year cgmp recertification by the sfda of jjb s small injectible line and the expiration of contracts with beauty distributors that sell topical hpe solution

china china gross profit was  for the year ended december   a decrease over the same period in where gross profit was  gross profit as compared to sales decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this decrease can be attributed to a change in the product mix as products shifted away from products reliant on the small injectible manufacturing line to other less profitable products as well as an increase in the cost of raw materials and an increase in manufacturing overhead 
the major components of cost of sales include raw materials  wages and salary and production overhead 
production overhead is comprised of depreciation of building  land use rights  and manufacturing equipment  amortization of production rights  utilities and repairs and maintenance
