item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in millions  except per share data business overview our businesses aggressively focused on opportunities in a very challenging environment in fiscal  improving year over year segment operating margins despite facing destocking from aerospace  european industrial gas turbine igt and chinese pipe customers  and lower average metal selling prices 
these results were principally driven by a continued focus on cost reduction and operational improvements across all of our segments 
also  during the year  we successfully acquired a strategically important business within the forged products segment and acquired a minority interest in a chinese pipe business 
on september   we completed the acquisition of carlton forge works and a related entity carlton for approximately million in cash  comprised of approximately million of cash on hand reduced million due to working capital adjustments and the proceeds of approximately million of commercial paper debt issuance 
carlton  a leading manufacturer of seamless rolled rings for critical aerospace applications  offers nickel  titanium  and steel rolled rings across the widest range of product sizes in the industry 
carlton broadens our forging capabilities and enables us to provide a full range of forged products to our aerospace engine customers 
the carlton acquisition is an asset purchase for tax purposes and operates as part of our forged products segment 
on january   we acquired a equity interest in yangzhou chengde steel tube co  ltd chengde for approximately million in cash  comprised of approximately million of cash on hand and the proceeds of approximately million of commercial paper debt issuance 
chengde is a leading manufacturer of seamless  extruded pipe for boiler applications in coal fired power plants  as well as pipe and tubing for other energy related applications  such as compressed natural gas 
the company operates from one facility with a manufacturing footprint of nearly million square feet  in the jiangsu province of china 
chengde has built a leading position in the chinese boiler pipe market and has begun to make inroads into export markets 
also  during the year  we continued to upgrade manufacturing equipment and increase operational productivity with the completion or initiation of various large scale cost reduction projects  primarily within the forged products segment 
we expect fiscal capital expenditures will be approximately equal to fiscal spending levels  with the most significant equipment upgrade and cost reduction projects planned within the forged products and investment cast products segments 
we fully understand the challenges ahead of us through the first half of fiscal our chinese pipe customers are making adjustments to their inventories as they transition to building larger  more eco friendly coal fired plants that will result in two full quarters of reduced seamless pipe shipments within our forged products segment and our recently acquired chinese pipe business 
the second quarter will also have its seasonal challenges of scheduled forge shutdowns for maintenance and extended holidays in our european operations 
looking ahead  we anticipate a strong second half of fiscal operations across all of our segments have established new cost structures that are poised to achieve solid results as the anticipated volume begins to return in the second half of fiscal we expect to see a realignment of component orders and aircraft build rates and initial orders as production ramps up 
igt schedules should stabilize and we believe we will continue to gain market share and expand our customer base 
we expect seamless pipe shipments will recover as chinese inventory is depleted 
we will manage the expected upturn as we did the downturn  with continued attention to daily results and focus on optimum performance

contractual material pass through pricing adjustments are calculated based on market prices such as those shown in the above table in trailing periods from one to twelve months 
in addition  our foreign operations reported approximately million in reduced us dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the increase in the value of the us dollar relative to international currencies  primarily the british pound 
the remaining decrease is primarily attributable to lower average metal selling prices at our businesses that employ price in effect metal pricing  and various other factors 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million of sales from carlton  which was acquired in the third quarter of this year 
with regard to growth in the commercial aircraft industry  based on data from the airline monitor as of january  boeing and airbus aircraft deliveries increased moderately from calendar year to  largely due to the boeing strike in the airline monitor expects boeing and airbus aircraft deliveries to be relatively flat in calendar year as compared to due to manufacturing lead times  our production volumes are generally to months ahead of aircraft deliveries and therefore  based on build rates  should also have been relatively flat 
however  our sales have been negatively impacted by a discrepancy between order rates and engine builds  which we believe has been due to inventory destocking in the supply chain 
we expect our aerospace sales to increase in fiscal as a result of the industry s higher projected deliveries in calendar year cost of goods sold was  million  or percent of sales  in fiscal as compared to  million  or percent of sales  in fiscal the improvement in the year over year percentage reflects increased productivity and improved material utilization compared to fiscal contractual material pass through pricing diluted gross margin by percentage points in fiscal compared to percentage points last year 
selling and administrative expenses were million  or percent of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal the higher year over year percentage was primarily due to higher expense related to our deferred compensation plan as compared to the prior year and the fixed nature of selling and administrative expenses coupled with a decrease in sales

accordingly  any operating results of these businesses are presented in our consolidated statements of income as discontinued operations  net of income tax  and all prior periods have been reclassified 
fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to dispose of a small non core business in the fasteners products segment and reclassified it to discontinued operations 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we decided to divest a small non core business in the investment cast products segment and reclassified it to discontinued operations 
the sale of the business was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal the transaction resulted in a gain of approximately million net of tax in fiscal fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  we decided to dispose of two automotive fastener operations 
the decision to discontinue these automotive fastener operations resulted from their non core nature coupled with further erosion in the automotive market 
these operations have been reclassified from the fasteners products segment to discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal we recognized an impairment loss of approximately million net of tax in the second quarter of fiscal related to these automotive fastener businesses held for sale due to continued erosion in the automotive market 

table of contents in the first quarter of fiscal  we sold the stock of several small entities  a group of foreign operations held for sale and previously recorded as discontinued from our former flow technologies pumps and valves business 
the transaction resulted in a net gain of approximately million in fiscal fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into an agreement to sell a fastener business headquartered in shannon  ireland

this alloy manufacturing business was reclassified from the forged products segment to discontinued operations and continues to be marketed 
in january  we completed the sale of a business located in france that produced alloys for approximately million 
this business was held for sale since the first quarter of fiscal the sale of the business generated a tax effected gain of million  or per share diluted in the fourth quarter of fiscal in january  we completed the sale of a specialty wire business for million 
this business was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal  and was reclassified from the forged products segment to discontinued operations during the third quarter of fiscal the sale of the business generated a tax effected gain of million  or per share diluted  of which million  or per share diluted  was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal restructuring  asset impairment and other non recurring charges we regularly assess our cost structure to ensure that operations are properly sized for prevailing market conditions  taking into consideration current and forecasted conditions in markets we serve 
during fiscal  we did not incur any restructuring or impairment charges 
the following restructuring and asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal and fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  we incurred restructuring and impairment charges of million pursuant to plans to downsize operations across all segments 
we had been gearing up for aerospace growth into fiscal  whereas demand decreased  particularly in the casting and forging aerospace markets 
the charges consisted of million for employee severance expenses and million for impairments and relocation expenses associated with long lived assets 
these restructuring plans provided for terminations of approximately employees in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and first quarter of fiscal the restructuring and impairment charges recorded by the investment cast products segment  forged products segment and fastener products segment were million  million and million  respectively  during fiscal as of march  and march   and million  respectively  remained in accrued liabilities related to the restructuring plans 
the tax effected impact of these charges was million  or per share diluted 
fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the investment cast products segment recorded restructuring charges of million  primarily for shut down costs associated with an underutilized machining operation located in the united kingdom 
the tax effected impact of these charges was million  or per share diluted 
impacts of the global economic recession and program delays economic events created recessionary economic conditions around the world in many industries in fiscal and although many countries and industries are recovering  weakness persists in many areas 
while we are 
table of contents not immune to impacts of the global recession  we believe our strong financial position enables us to take advantage of opportunities in our markets served  continue to make operational improvements in our businesses and benefit from the economic recovery 
during the fiscal year  approximately percent of our sales were to customers in the global aerospace markets 
until the recession occurred and aerospace program delays were announced  customer schedules indicated that the aerospace production rates would continue to experience growth throughout fiscal and possibly beyond  particularly due to anticipated build rates of major new aerospace programs such as the boeing and airbus a  each of which contains significant per ship set revenue for pcc 
aircraft manufacturer schedules now indicate that aerospace production rates will remain relatively flat for the first half of fiscal as compared with fiscal levels  but we expect to see a realignment of component build rates and aircraft production schedules as destocking ends in the supply chain and as boeing and airbus a production starts to ramp up in the second half of fiscal our most significant customers in the aerospace industry are primarily large  well financed businesses that we believe have the ability to weather the economic downturn 
therefore  while there is significant uncertainty as to the direction of the economy in future periods  we have not experienced  and do not anticipate significant collection issues with our accounts receivable or marketability of our in process inventories 
however  our customers depend on demand from their end use customers  as well as the end use customers financial viability  of which we are unable to make an assessment 
we must rely on the forecasted information provided from time to time by our customers as guidance with regard to the impacts from the current and future economic environment 
during fiscal  approximately percent of our sales were to customers in the global power markets  which include our igt business as well as sales of our seamless extruded pipe 
demand in our oem igt markets has softened and during the latter half of fiscal  we experienced the beginning of destocking by our european customers 
during our fiscal fourth quarter  seamless pipe sales declined due to a change in chinese customers ordering patterns as they started to work through current inventory and transition to building larger  more eco friendly coal fired plants 
our most significant customers in the power markets are primarily large  well financed businesses that we believe should have the ability to weather the economic downturn or are customers for which sales are backed by letters of credit on which we believe there is little risk of default 
therefore  we have not experienced and do not anticipate significant collection issues with our accounts receivable or marketability of our in process inventories 
however  our customers depend on demand from their end use customers  as well as the end use customers financial viability  of which we are unable to make an assessment 
we must rely on the forecasted information provided from time to time by our customers as guidance with regard to the impacts from the current and future economic environment 
the remaining percent of our sales in fiscal were into general industrial markets 
it is difficult to summarize the opportunities and challenges in these markets  because the circumstances vary widely from one individual market to another 
we have taken  and will continue to take  precautionary measures with customers in these markets to limit our exposure  to the extent possible  to potential bankruptcies and other financial issues experienced by these customers 
these measures include shortening cash collection terms  regular updating of credit profiles  discontinuance of further business with customers not paying in a timely manner and the requirement of cash in advance of shipments  among others 
due to the diversity of markets and customer profiles in these businesses and the precautionary steps referred to previously  we have not experienced and do not anticipate severe impacts on our business or significant exposure to credit losses in these markets 
however  it is possible that we may experience unanticipated unfavorable impacts 
we follow an investment philosophy of diversified investing and risk mitigation when managing our pension plans 
the investments in our pension plans totaled approximately billion at the end of fiscal during fiscal  we contributed million to our defined benefit pension plans  including voluntary contributions of million  to increase plan funding 
we believe our financial position and liquidity will allow us to make all required pension contributions as well as any additional voluntary contributions that management deems advisable 
we made a voluntary contribution of million to the defined benefit pension plans in early fiscal see the changes in financial condition and liquidity section for a discussion of the impact of the global financial climate and credit shortage on liquidity

these increased volumes  driven across the business s improved cost structure  will help the segment achieve even stronger operational performance 
fiscal compared with fiscal the fastener products segment reported fiscal sales of  million  a percent increase from fiscal sales of  million 
the increase in sales primarily resulted from aerospace sales growing approximately percent compared to the prior year largely due to market share gains 
the growth in aerospace sales included approximately million related to airdrome and fti  which were acquired in the third quarter of fiscal the segment overcame negative pressures due to the boeing strike  which accounted for a decrease in fastener products sales of approximately million in fiscal additional negative impacts to sales in this segment included the continuation of a depressed north american automotive market  coupled with softening in both the european and brazilian automotive markets  as well as weakness in other areas of the general industrial market 
in addition  our foreign operations reported approximately million in reduced us dollar equivalent sales year over year due to the strong increase in the value of the us dollar relative to international currencies  primarily the british pound and brazilian real 
operating income for the fasteners segment was million or percent of sales in fiscal  compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal the improvement in operating margins reflected 
table of contents leverage from the increased sales volume and increased sales in the higher margin aerospace business  as well as the impact of continued efforts to reduce costs and improve manufacturing processes 
this was slightly offset by the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar  which had a negative impact of approximately million on operating income in fiscal interest and taxes net interest expense in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the higher net interest expense was primarily due to lower interest income earned on lower interest rates and lower average cash balances 
net interest expense in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the lower net interest expense was due to significantly reduced debt levels  lower borrowing rates  and higher interest income earned on higher average cash balances compared to fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent  percentage points higher than the percent effective tax rate in fiscal the slight increase in the full year tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily due to reduced benefits from the us manufacturing deduction  an increase in state taxes and non benefitted foreign losses in the current year  offset by increased benefits from foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the statutory us tax rate 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent  percentage points higher than the percent effective tax rate in fiscal the increase in tax rate was principally due to reduced tax benefits from lower foreign tax rates  a decrease in benefits from the us manufacturing deduction due to increased tax deductions for pension contributions  and a reduction in favorable audit settlements year over year  partially offset by an increase in benefits from the federal research credit 
liquidity and capital resources total assets of  million at march  represented a million increase from the  million balance at march  the increase principally reflects cash generated during the year from operations totaling million and the addition of million of total assets from the acquisition of carlton  partially offset by million in cash paid to acquire carlton 
total capitalization at march  was  million  consisting of million of debt and  million of equity 
the debt to capitalization ratio declined to at march  from at the end of fiscal  reflecting the impact of increased equity from earnings and lower cumulative translation adjustments  in addition to reduced debt 
cash as of march  was million  down million from the end of fiscal  and total debt was million  down million since the end of fiscal the negative net cash flow of million reflects million of cash paid for the acquisition of carlton  million paid for the acquisition of our interest in chengde  capital expenditures of million  million paid related to the acquisition of caledonian  and cash dividends of million  partially offset by cash generated from operations of million and million from the issuance of common stock 
capital spending of million in fiscal principally provided for cost reduction and equipment upgrades throughout the company 
the capital spending plan for fiscal  which is anticipated to be similar to the capital spending level in fiscal  will be targeted for equipment upgrades and cost reduction and productivity projects throughout the company 
during fiscal  we contributed million to the defined benefit pension plans  of which million was voluntary 
in addition  we contributed million to the other postretirement benefit plans during fiscal year we expect to contribute approximately million to the defined benefit pension plans in fiscal  of which million is voluntary 
we expect to contribute approximately million to the other postretirement benefit plans during fiscal year we believe we will be able to meet our short and longer term liquidity needs for working capital  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  capital spending  cash dividends  scheduled repayment of debt and 
table of contents potential acquisitions from cash generated from operations  borrowing from our existing billion revolving credit facility or new bank credit facilities  the issuance of public or privately placed debt securities  or the issuance of equity instruments 
as noted above  our revolving bank credit facility credit agreement provides available borrowing up to billion through may our unused borrowing capacity as of march  was million under the credit agreement  reduced by a million workers compensation letter of credit issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal the credit agreement contains various standard financial covenants  including maintenance of minimum net worth  interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio 
the financial covenants in the credit agreement are our most restrictive covenants 
our covenant requirements and actual ratios as of march  were as follows dollars in millions covenant requirement actual consolidated minimum net worth  minimum  consolidated interest coverage ratio minimum consolidated leverage ratio maximum terms are defined in the amended and restated credit agreement 
as of march   we were in compliance with all financial covenants of our loan agreements 
historically  we have also issued commercial paper as a method of raising short term liquidity 
we believe we continue to have the ability to issue commercial paper  even in the current credit markets  and have issued commercial paper in the third and fourth quarters to cover acquisitions and short term cash requirements 
we do not anticipate any changes in our ability to borrow under our current credit facility  but changes in the financial condition of the participating financial institutions could negatively impact our ability to borrow funds in the future 
should that circumstance arise  we believe that we would be able to arrange any needed financing  although we are not able to predict what the terms of any such borrowings would be  or the source of the borrowed funds 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and lease agreements 
the following table represents our contractual cash obligations as of march  and the estimated timing of future cash payments contractual cash obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases interest on fixed rate debt interest on variable rate debt total operating lease obligations include million attributable to an operation held for sale 
interest on variable rate debt is based on current prevailing interest rates 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions at march  was million 
due to the uncertainties associated with settling these liabilities  we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these liabilities 
as a result  our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits is excluded from the table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our reserve for uncertain tax positions 
the table above also excludes estimated required cash contributions to our qualified pension plans totaling approximately million over the next five years million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we also have benefit payments due under our non qualified pension and other post retirement benefit plans that are not required to be funded in advance  but are pay as you go 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout the management s discussion and analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
note that the preparation of this annual report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order  ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured  and pricing is fixed and determinable 
in instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment  we recognize revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance  depending on terms of the sales agreement 
service sales  representing maintenance and engineering activities  are recognized as services are performed 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue 
valuation of inventories all inventories are stated at the lower of the cost of purchase or manufacture of the inventory or the estimated market value of the inventory 
cost for inventories at a significant number of our operations is determined on a last in  first out lifo basis 
the average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on the age  historical usage or assumptions about future demand for the inventory 
we also regularly review inventory balances on a lifo basis to ensure the balances are stated at the lower of cost or market as of the balance sheet date 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
goodwill and acquired intangibles from time to time  we acquire businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at a minimum each fiscal year at the end of the second month in the second quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
for fiscal  our reporting units consisted of the three operating segments within our investment cast products reportable operating segment  two operating segments within our forged products reportable operating segment  as well as a number of reporting units in our fasteners products operating segment 
the fasteners products operating segment includes several aggregated component units referred to as the fasteners products reporting unit and three other reporting units for which the segment manager regularly reviews performance 
testing for goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations 
such models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions primarily based on future cash flows  expected market growth rates  our estimates of sales volumes  sales prices and related costs  and the discount rate applied  which reflects the weighted average cost of capital 
management uses the best available information at the time fair values of the reporting units are estimated  however  estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements potentially resulting from an impairment of the goodwill 
we also consider comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of 
table of contents the reporting units 
the cash flow models used to determine fair value are most sensitive to the expected future cash flows and the discount rate for each reporting unit 
the discount rate used in the cash flow models for the fiscal goodwill impairment analysis ranged from to depending on the reporting unit 
the annual growth rate for earnings before interest and taxes varied by reporting unit and ranged from to over the initial five year forecast period 
a sensitivity analysis determined that using terminal growth rates of  or would not result in impairment in the fiscal goodwill impairment analysis 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on both of these factors and determined that the forecast for future earnings before interest and taxes used in the cash flow model could decrease by and the discount rate utilized could increase by  and the goodwill of our reporting units would not be impaired 
the reporting unit that would be most sensitive to worsening economic conditions has million of goodwill recorded as of march  environmental costs the estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are accrued on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of remediation costs can be reasonably estimated 
when only a range of amounts is established  and no amount within the range is better than another  the minimum amount of the range is recorded 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is probable 
adjustments to our accruals may be necessary to reflect new information as investigation and remediation efforts proceed 
the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period  but any amounts  and the possible range of any amounts in excess of those already accrued  are not reasonably estimable at this time 
total environmental reserves accrued at march  and march  were million and million  respectively 
guidance on asset retirement and environmental obligations clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
asset retirement obligations covered by this guidance include those for which an entity has a significant obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  however the timing or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may not be within the control of the entity 
this guidance also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
in accordance with the asset retirement and environmental obligations guidance  we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability can be reasonably estimated 
currently  we have identified known asset retirement obligations associated with environmental contamination at two of our manufacturing facilities 
however  we have not recognized a liability under this guidance for these retirement obligations because the fair value of remediation at these sites cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement date is unknown at this time 
the settlement date is unknown because remediation of these sites is not required until production ceases  and we have no current or future plans to cease production 
these asset retirement obligations  when estimable  are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or business 
income taxes provisions for federal  state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre tax earnings based on current tax law and also include  in the current period  the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
tax benefits arising from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities 
the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefit plans we sponsor many domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans 
our pension and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans accounting guidance 
plan assets have been valued at fair value in accordance with this guidance 
pension and postretirement expense and liability amounts are derived from several significant assumptions  including the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rate 
we derive a market based discount rate from yields on high quality  liquid fixed income securities  at the end of our fiscal year for valuation of our pension liabilities 
we use only highly rated bonds aa aa or higher to estimate the interest rate at which our pension benefits could be settled 
our assumed return on plan assets is derived from a review of past performance  anticipated future performance in light of market conditions and our investment allocation and consultation with our investment advisors 
as the assumed rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption  it is not anticipated to be as volatile as the discount rate  which is a point in time measurement 
for our us plans  we used a long term rate of return assumption of to calculate the and net periodic pension cost 
for our non us plans  we used a long term rate of return assumption of to calculate the and net periodic pension cost 
in developing the long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions  we evaluated input from third party pension consultants and actuaries  reviewed asset allocation and investment strategies  ranges of projected and historical returns  and inflation and economic assumptions 
the expected return assumptions are derived from asset allocations within the company s target asset allocation ranges consistent with the company s diversified investment approach 
for our us plans  we used a discount rate assumption of for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our march  measurement date 
for our non us plans  we used a discount rate assumption of for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our march  measurement date 
for fiscal  our us net periodic pension expense was million and non us net periodic pension income was million 
we estimate that for fiscal  our us net periodic pension expense will be approximately million and non us net periodic pension income will be approximately million 
the table below quantifies the approximate impact  as of march   of a one quarter percentage point decrease in our assumptions for discount rate and expected return on assets  holding other assumptions constant 
percentage point decrease increase in annual costs discount rate expected long term rate of return increase in projected benefit obligation discount rate the approximate impact  as of march   of a one percentage point increase in our assumption for the health care cost trend rate  holding other assumptions constant  on our total service and interest cost components and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is not significant 
recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued guidance which requires new disclosures and clarifies existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
specifically  the changes require disclosure of transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements  and also require more detailed disclosure about the activity within level fair value measurements 
this guidance was effective for the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal  except for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements of level assets and liabilities  which will be effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal as this guidance only requires expanded disclosures  the adoption did not and will not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

this guidance was effective for the company in the second quarter of fiscal the adoption did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued guidance on an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan

in december  the fasb issued guidance on business combinations and noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
this guidance introduces significant changes in the accounting for and reporting of business acquisitions and noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary 
this guidance continues the movement toward the greater use of fair values in financial reporting and increased transparency through expanded disclosures 
the business combinations guidance changes how business acquisitions are accounted for  including expensing acquisition costs as incurred  and will impact financial statements at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
the noncontrolling interests guidance requires noncontrolling interests previously referred to as minority interests to be reported as a component of equity  which changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders 
the business combinations guidance was effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of our fiscal  and was applicable to our acquisition of carlton on september  the noncontrolling interests guidance was effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of the noncontrolling interests guidance did not have a significant impact on the reporting of our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as noncontrolling interests are not material to the financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at various times  we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and prices of strategic raw materials 
fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge 
because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes  they do not represent incremental risk to the company
