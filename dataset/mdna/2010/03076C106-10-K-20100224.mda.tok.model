item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statements  our consolidated financial statements and notes that follow and the consolidated five year summary of selected financial data and the risk factors included in our annual report on form k 
certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current presentation 
overview we provide financial planning  products and services that are designed to be utilized as solutions for our clients cash and liquidity  asset accumulation  income  protection and estate and wealth transfer needs 
our model for delivering these solutions is centered on building long term personal relationships between our affiliated advisors and clients  and in the case of our products distributed through unaffiliated advisors  by supporting those advisors in building strong client relationships 
we believe that our focus on personal relationships  together with our strengths in financial planning and product development  allow us to better address the evolving financial needs of our clients and our primary target market segment  the mass affluent and affluent  which we define as households with investable assets of more than  our branded affiliated advisors financial planning and advisory process is designed to provide comprehensive advice  when appropriate  to address our clients cash and liquidity  asset accumulation  income  protection  and estate and wealth transfer needs 
this approach allows us to recommend actions and a range of product solutions consisting of investment  annuity  insurance  banking and other financial products that help clients attain over time a return or form of protection while accepting what they determine to be an appropriate range and level of risk 
our focus puts us in a strong position to capitalize on significant demographic and market trends  which we believe will continue to drive increased demand for our financial planning and other financial services 
our focus on deep client advisor relationships has been central to the ability of our business model to succeed through the extreme market conditions of and  and we believe it will help us to respond to future market cycles 
our multi platform network of affiliated financial advisors is the primary means by which we develop personal relationships with retail clients 
as of december   we had a network of more than  financial advisors and registered representatives affiliated financial advisors 
we refer to the affiliated financial advisors who use our brand name as our branded advisors  and those who do not use our brand name but who are affiliated as registered representatives of ours  as our unbranded advisors 
the financial product solutions we offer through our affiliated advisors include both our own products and services and the products of other companies 
our branded advisor network is the primary distribution channel through which we offer our investment and annuity products and services  as well as a range of banking and protection products 
our asset management  annuity and auto and home protection products are also distributed through unaffiliated advisors and affinity relationships 
we offer our branded advisors training  tools  leadership  marketing programs and other field and centralized support to assist them in delivering advice and product solutions to clients 
we support unaffiliated advisors with strong sales and service support and our solutions which they provide to clients 
we believe our approach not only improves the products and services we provide to their clients  but allows us to reinvest in enhanced services for clients and increase support for financial advisors 
our integrated model of financial planning  diversified product manufacturing and affiliated and non affiliated product distribution affords us a better understanding of our clients  which allows us to better manage the risk profile of our businesses 
we believe our focus on meeting clients needs through personal financial planning results in more satisfied clients with deeper  longer lasting relationships with our company and a higher retention of experienced financial advisors 
we have four main operating segments advice wealth management  asset management  annuities and protection  as well as our corporate other segment 
our four main operating segments are aligned with the financial solutions we offer to address our clients needs 
the products and services we provide retail clients and  to a lesser extent  institutional clients  are the primary source of our revenues and net income 
revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies 
these factors  in turn  are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships 
equity price  credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations  primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset based fees we earn  the spread income generated on our annuities  banking and deposit products and universal life ul insurance products  the value of deferred acquisition costs dac and deferred sales annual report 
table of contents inducement costs dsic assets associated with variable annuity and variable ul products  the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits

it is management s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi year horizon by achieving our on average  over time financial targets 
our financial targets are net revenue growth of to  earnings per diluted share growth of to  and return on equity of to 
net revenues for the year ended december  were billion  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
net income attributable to ameriprise financial for the year ended december  was million compared to a net loss attributable to ameriprise financial of million for the year ended december  earnings per diluted share for the year ended december  were  compared to a loss per share of for the year ended december  on september   we announced a definitive agreement to acquire the long term asset management business of columbia management group columbia from bank of america  na the total consideration to be paid will be between million and billion based on net asset flows at columbia before closing and is expected to be funded through the use of cash on hand 
the transaction is expected to close in the spring of  subject to satisfaction of closing conditions that are generally present in similar acquisitions 
related to the transaction  we incurred million of pretax non recurring acquisition and integration costs during the year ended december   and expect to incur between million and million of such costs through these costs include system integration costs  proxy and other regulatory filing costs  employee reduction and retention costs  and investment banking  legal and other acquisition costs 
we continue to establish ameriprise financial as a financial services leader as we focus on meeting the financial needs of the mass affluent and affluent  as evidenced by our continued leadership in financial planning  a client retention percentage rate of  and  upon the anticipated closing of our acquisition of columbia s long term asset management business  our status as a top ten ranked firm within core portions of each of our four main operating segments  including our us advisor force  long term us mutual funds  variable annuities and variable universal life insurance 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed the all cash acquisitions of h r block financial advisors  inc  subsequently renamed ameriprise advisor services  inc aasi  j 
w 
seligman co  incorporated seligman and brecek young advisors  inc to expand our retail distribution and asset management businesses 
the cost of the acquisitions was million  which included the purchase price and transaction costs 
we recorded the assets and liabilities acquired at fair value and allocated the remaining costs to goodwill and intangible assets 
integration charges of million and million were included in general and administrative expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
separation from american express on february   the american express board of directors announced its intention to pursue the disposition of of its shareholdings in our company the separation through a tax free distribution to american express shareholders 
effective as of the close of business on september   american express completed the separation of our company and the distribution of our common shares to american express shareholders the distribution 
prior to the distribution  we had been a wholly owned subsidiary of american express 
our separation from american express resulted in specifically identifiable impacts to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
we incurred a total of million of non recurring separation costs as part of our separation from american express 
these costs were primarily associated with establishing the ameriprise financial brand  separating and reestablishing our technology platforms and advisor and employee retention programs 
our separation from american express was completed in annual report 
table of contents critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition and  in some cases  the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates  judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting and reporting policies we have identified as fundamental to a full understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are described below 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our accounting policies 
valuation of investments the most significant component of our investments is our available for sale securities  which we carry at fair value within our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  was primarily obtained from third party pricing sources 
we record unrealized securities gains losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income tax provision benefit and net of adjustments in other asset and liability balances  such as dac  to reflect the expected impact on their carrying values had the unrealized securities gains losses been realized as of the respective balance sheet dates 
we recognize gains and losses in results of operations upon disposition of the securities 
effective january   we early adopted an accounting standard that significantly changed our accounting policy regarding the timing and amount of other than temporary impairments for available for sale securities 
when the fair value of an investment is less than its amortized cost  we assess whether or not i we have the intent to sell the security made a decision to sell or ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery 
if either of these conditions is met  an other than temporary impairment is considered to have occurred and we must recognize an other than temporary impairment for the difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value through earnings 
for securities that do not meet the above criteria  and we do not expect to recover a security s amortized cost basis  the security is also considered other than temporarily impaired 
for these securities  we separate the total impairment into the credit loss component and the amount of the loss related to other factors 
the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to credit loss is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of impacts to dac  dsic  certain benefit reserves and income taxes 
for available for sale securities that have recognized an other than temporary impairment through earnings  if through subsequent evaluation there is a significant increase in the cash flow expected  the difference between the amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as interest income 
subsequent increases and decreases in the fair value of available for sale securities are included in other comprehensive income 
for all securities that are considered temporarily impaired  we do not intend to sell these securities have not made a decision to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
we believe that we will collect all principal and interest due on all investments that have amortized cost in excess of fair value that are considered only temporarily impaired 
factors we consider in determining whether declines in the fair value of fixed maturity securities are other than temporary include i the extent to which the market value is below amortized cost  ii the duration of time in which there has been a significant decline in value  iii fundamental analysis of the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer  and iv market events that could impact credit ratings  economic and business climate  litigation and government actions  and similar external business factors 
in order to determine the amount of the credit loss component for corporate debt securities considered other than temporarily impaired  a best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected discounted at the security s effective interest rate is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security 
the significant inputs to cash flow projections consider potential debt restructuring terms  projected cash flows available to pay creditors and our position in the debtor s overall capital structure 
for structured investments eg  residential mortgage backed securities  commercial mortgage backed securities  asset backed securities and other structured investments  we also consider factors such as overall deal structure and our position within the structure  quality of underlying collateral  delinquencies and defaults  loss severities  recoveries  prepayments and cumulative loss projections in assessing potential other than temporary impairments of these investments 
based upon these factors  securities that have indicators of potential other than temporary impairment are subject to detailed review by management 
securities for which declines are considered temporary continue to be carefully monitored by management 
generally  the credit loss component for the non agency mortgage backed securities is determined as the amount the amortized cost basis exceeds the present value of the projected cash flows expected to be collected 
annual report 
table of contents significant inputs considered in these projections are consistent with the factors considered in assessing potential other than temporary impairment for these investments 
current contractual interest rates considered in these cash flow projections are used to calculate the discount rate used to determine the present value of the expected cash flows 
deferred acquisition costs and deferred sales inducement costs for our annuity and life  disability income and long term care insurance products  our dac and dsic balances at any reporting date are supported by projections that show management expects there to be adequate premiums or estimated gross profits after that date to amortize the remaining dac and dsic balances 
these projections are inherently uncertain because they require management to make assumptions about financial markets  anticipated mortality and morbidity levels and policyholder behavior over periods extending well into the future 
projection periods used for our annuity products are typically to years  while projection periods for our life  disability income and long term care insurance products are often years or longer 
management regularly monitors financial market conditions and actual policyholder behavior experience and compares them to its assumptions 
for annuity and universal life insurance products  the assumptions made in projecting future results and calculating the dac balance and dac amortization expense are management s best estimates 
management is required to update these assumptions whenever it appears that  based on actual experience or other evidence  earlier estimates should be revised 
when assumptions are changed  the percentage of estimated gross profits used to amortize dac might also change 
a change in the required amortization percentage is applied retrospectively  an increase in amortization percentage will result in a decrease in the dac balance and an increase in dac amortization expense  while a decrease in amortization percentage will result in an increase in the dac balance and a decrease in dac amortization expense 
the impact on results of operations of changing assumptions can be either positive or negative in any particular period and is reflected in the period in which such changes are made 
for products with associated dsic  the same policy applies in calculating the dsic balance and periodic dsic amortization 
for other life  disability income and long term care insurance products  the assumptions made in calculating our dac balance and dac amortization expense are consistent with those used in determining the liabilities and  therefore  are intended to provide for adverse deviations in experience and are revised only if management concludes experience will be so adverse that dac are not recoverable 
if management concludes that dac are not recoverable  dac are reduced to the amount that is recoverable based on best estimate assumptions and there is a corresponding expense recorded in our consolidated results of operations 
for annuity and life  disability income and long term care insurance products  key assumptions underlying these long term projections include interest rates both earning rates on invested assets and rates credited to contractholder and policyholder accounts  equity market performance  mortality and morbidity rates and the rates at which policyholders are expected to surrender their contracts  make withdrawals from their contracts and make additional deposits to their contracts 
assumptions about earned and credited interest rates are the primary factors used to project interest margins  while assumptions about equity and bond market performance are the primary factors used to project client asset value growth rates  and assumptions about surrenders  withdrawals and deposits comprise projected persistency rates 
management must also make assumptions to project maintenance expenses associated with servicing our annuity and insurance businesses during the dac amortization period 
the client asset value growth rates are the rates at which variable annuity and variable universal life insurance contract values invested in separate accounts are assumed to appreciate in the future 
the rates used vary by equity and fixed income investments 
management reviews and  where appropriate  adjusts its assumptions with respect to client asset value growth rates on a regular basis 
we typically use a five year mean reversion process as a guideline in setting near term equity asset growth rates based on a long term view of financial market performance as well as recent actual performance 
the suggested near term growth rate is reviewed to ensure consistency with management s assessment of anticipated equity market performance 
in  management continued to follow the mean reversion process  decreasing near term equity asset growth rates to reflect the positive market 
the long term client asset value growth rates are based on assumed gross annual total returns of for equities and for fixed income securities 
a decrease of basis points in various rate assumptions is likely to result in an increase in dac and dsic amortization and an increase in benefits and claims expense from variable annuity guarantees 
the following table presents the estimated impact to pretax income estimated impact to pretax income in millions decrease in future near and long term equity returns by basis points decrease in future near and long term fixed income returns by basis points decrease in near term equity asset growth returns by basis points an increase in the above assumptions by basis points would result in an increase to pretax income for approximately the same amount 
annual report 
table of contents we monitor other principal dac and dsic amortization assumptions  such as persistency  mortality  morbidity  interest margin and maintenance expense levels each quarter and  when assessed independently  each could impact our dac and dsic balances 
the analysis of dac and dsic balances and the corresponding amortization is a dynamic process that considers all relevant factors and assumptions described previously 
unless management identifies a significant deviation over the course of the quarterly monitoring  management reviews and updates these dac and dsic amortization assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year 
an assessment of sensitivity associated with changes in any single assumption would not necessarily be an indicator of future results 
liabilities for future policy benefits and policy claims and other policyholders funds fixed annuities and variable annuity guarantees future policy benefits and policy claims and other policyholders funds related to fixed annuities and variable annuity guarantees include liabilities for fixed account values on fixed and variable deferred annuities  guaranteed benefits associated with variable annuities  equity indexed annuities and fixed annuities in a payout status 
liabilities for fixed account values on fixed and variable deferred annuities are equal to accumulation values  which are the cumulative gross deposits and credited interest less withdrawals and various charges 
the majority of the variable annuity contracts offered by us contain guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb provisions 
when market values of the customer s accounts decline  the death benefit payable on a contract with a gmdb may exceed the contract accumulation value 
we also offer variable annuities with death benefit provisions that gross up the amount payable by a certain percentage of contract earnings which are referred to as gain gross up benefits 
in addition  we offer contracts with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit gmab provisions and  until may  the company offered contracts containing guaranteed minimum income benefit gmib provisions 
in determining the liabilities for gmdb  gmib and the life contingent benefits associated with gmwb  we project these benefits and contract assessments using actuarial models to simulate various equity market scenarios 
significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to customer asset value growth rates  mortality  persistency and investment margins and are consistent with those used for dac asset valuation for the same contracts 
as with dac  management reviews  and where appropriate  adjusts its assumptions each quarter 
unless management identifies a material deviation over the course of quarterly monitoring  management reviews and updates these assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year 
the amounts in the table above in deferred acquisition costs and deferred sales inducement costs include the estimated impact to benefits and claims expense related to variable annuity guarantees resulting from a decrease of basis points in various rate assumptions 
the gmdb liability is determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected contract accumulation value and recognizing the excess over the estimated meaningful life based on expected assessments eg  mortality and expense fees  contractual administrative charges and similar fees 
if elected by the contract owner and after a stipulated waiting period from contract issuance  a gmib guarantees a minimum lifetime annuity based on a specified rate of contract accumulation value growth and predetermined annuity purchase rates 
the gmib liability is determined each period by estimating the expected value of annuitization benefits in excess of the projected contract accumulation value at the date of annuitization and recognizing the excess over the estimated meaningful life based on expected assessments 
the embedded derivatives related to gmab and the non life contingent benefits associated with gmwb provisions are recorded at fair value 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the fair value measurement of embedded derivatives 
the liability for the life contingent benefits associated with gmwb provisions is determined in the same way as the gmdb liability 
the changes in both the fair values of the gmwb and gmab embedded derivatives and the liability for life contingent benefits are reflected in benefits  claims  losses and settlement expenses 
liabilities for equity indexed annuities are equal to the accumulation of host contract values covering guaranteed benefits and the fair value of embedded equity options 
liabilities for fixed annuities in a benefit or payout status are based on future estimated payments using established industry mortality tables and interest rates  ranging from to at december   depending on year of issue  with an average rate of approximately annual report 
table of contents life  disability income and long term care insurance future policy benefits and policy claims and other policyholders funds related to life  disability income and long term care insurance include liabilities for fixed account values on fixed and variable universal life policies  liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported claims  estimates of benefits payable on claims incurred but not yet reported and estimates of benefits that will become payable on term life  whole life  disability income and long term care policies as claims are incurred in the future 
liabilities for fixed account values on fixed and variable universal life insurance are equal to accumulation values 
accumulation values are the cumulative gross deposits and credited interest less various contractual expense and mortality charges and less amounts withdrawn by policyholders 
liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported life insurance claims are equal to the death benefits payable under the policies 
liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported disability income and long term care claims include any periodic or other benefit amounts due and accrued  along with estimates of the present value of obligations for continuing benefit payments 
these amounts are calculated based on claim continuance tables which estimate the likelihood an individual will continue to be eligible for benefits 
present values are calculated at interest rates established when claims are incurred 
anticipated claim continuance rates are based on established industry tables  adjusted as appropriate for our experience 
interest rates used with disability income claims ranged from to at december   with an average rate of 
interest rates used with long term care claims ranged from to at december   with an average rate of liabilities for estimated benefits payable on claims that have been incurred but not yet reported are based on periodic analysis of the actual time lag between when a claim occurs and when it is reported 
liabilities for estimates of benefits that will become payable on future claims on term life  whole life  disability income and long term care policies are based on the net level premium method  using anticipated premium payments  mortality and morbidity rates  policy persistency and interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability 
anticipated mortality and morbidity rates are based on established industry mortality and morbidity tables  with modifications based on our experience 
anticipated premium payments and persistency rates vary by policy form  issue age  policy duration and certain other pricing factors 
anticipated interest rates for term and whole life ranged from to at december   depending on policy form  issue year and policy duration 
anticipated interest rates for disability income vary by plan and were and at policy issue grading to over five years and over years  respectively 
anticipated interest rates for long term care policy reserves can vary by plan and year and ranged from to at december  where applicable  benefit amounts expected to be recoverable from reinsurance companies who share in the risk are separately recorded as reinsurance recoverable within receivables 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to various market risks 
all derivatives are recorded at fair value 
the fair value of our derivative instruments is determined using either market quotes or valuation models that are based upon the net present value of estimated future cash flows and incorporate current market observable inputs to the extent available 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on its intended use and the resulting hedge designation  if any 
we primarily use derivatives as economic hedges that are not designated as accounting hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
we occasionally designate derivatives as i hedges of changes in the fair value of assets  liabilities or firm commitments fair value hedges  ii hedges of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedges or iii hedges of foreign currency exposures of net investments in foreign operations net investment hedges in foreign operations 
our policy is to not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivatives and collateral arrangements executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement 
for derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in current period earnings 
the changes in fair value of derivatives hedging variable annuity living benefits and certain variable annuity death benefits are included within benefits  claims  losses and settlement expenses 
the changes in fair value of derivatives hedging equity indexed annuities and stock market certificates are included within interest credited to fixed accounts and banking and deposit interest expense  respectively 
the changes in fair value of all other derivatives are a component of annual report 
table of contents net investment income 
our derivatives primarily provide economic hedges to equity market and interest rate exposures 
examples include structured derivatives  options  futures  equity and interest rate swaps and swaptions that economically hedge the equity and interest rate exposure of derivatives embedded in certain annuity and certificate liabilities  as well as exposure to price risk arising from affiliated mutual fund seed money investments 
for derivative instruments that qualify as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivatives  as well as of the hedged risk within the corresponding hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments are recognized in current earnings 
if a fair value hedge designation is removed or the hedge is terminated prior to maturity  previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged item are recognized into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item 
for derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portions of the gain or loss on the derivative instruments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings when the hedged item or transaction impacts earnings 
any ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported currently in earnings 
if a hedge designation is removed or a hedge is terminated prior to maturity  the amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss is recognized into earnings over the period that the hedged item impacts earnings 
for any hedge relationships that are discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original strategy  any related amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are recognized in earnings immediately 
for derivative instruments that qualify as net investment hedges in foreign operations  the effective portions of the change in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment 
any ineffective portions of net investment hedges in foreign operations are recognized in earnings during the period of change 
for further details on the types of derivatives we use and how we account for them  see note and note to our consolidated financial statements 
income tax accounting income taxes  as reported in our consolidated financial statements  represent the net amount of income taxes that we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions in connection with our operations 
we provide for income taxes based on amounts that we believe we will ultimately owe taking into account the recognition and measurement for uncertain tax positions 
inherent in the provision for income taxes are estimates and judgments regarding the tax treatment of certain items 
in the event that the ultimate tax treatment of items differs from our estimates  we may be required to significantly change the provision for income taxes recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the provision for income taxes  our consolidated financial statements reflect certain amounts related to deferred tax assets and liabilities  which result from temporary differences between the assets and liabilities measured for financial statement purposes versus the assets and liabilities measured for tax return purposes 
among our deferred tax assets is a significant deferred tax asset relating to capital losses that have been recognized for financial statement purposes but not yet for tax return purposes 
under current us federal income tax law  capital losses generally must be used against capital gain income within five years of the year in which the capital losses are recognized for tax purposes 
our life insurance subsidiaries will not be able to file a consolidated us federal income tax return with the other members of our affiliated group until  which will result in net operating and capital losses  credits and other tax attributes generated by one group not being available to offset income earned or taxes owed by the other group during the period of non consolidation 
this lack of consolidation could affect our ability to fully realize certain of our deferred tax assets  including the capital losses 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance for any portion of our deferred tax assets that management believes will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining if a valuation allowance should be established  and the amount of such allowance if required 
factors used in making this determination include estimates relating to the performance of the business including the ability to generate capital gains 
consideration is given to  among other things in making this determination  i future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  ii future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  iii taxable income in prior carryback years  and iv tax planning strategies 
it is likely that management will need to identify and implement appropriate planning strategies to ensure our ability to realize our deferred tax assets and avoid the establishment of a valuation annual report 
table of contents allowance with respect to such assets 
in the opinion of management  it is currently more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets  including our capital loss deferred tax asset  therefore  no such valuation allowance has been established 
recent accounting pronouncements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations or financial condition  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
sources of revenues and expenses management and financial advice fees management and financial advice fees relate primarily to fees earned from managing mutual funds  separate account and wrap account assets  institutional investments  including structured investments  as well as fees earned from providing financial advice and administrative services including transfer agent  administration and custodial fees earned from providing services to retail mutual funds 
management and financial advice fees also include mortality and expense risk fees earned on separate account assets 
our management fees are generally accrued daily and collected monthly 
a significant portion of our management fees are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our managed assets 
the substantial majority of our managed assets are valued by independent pricing services vendors based upon observable market data 
the selection of our pricing services vendors and the reliability of their prices are subject to certain governance procedures  such as periodic comparison across pricing vendors  due diligence reviews  daily price variance analysis  subsequent sales testing  stale price review  pricing vendor challenge process  and valuation committee oversight 
many of our mutual funds have a performance incentive adjustment pia 
the pia increases or decreases the level of management fees received based on the specific fund s relative performance as measured against a designated external index 
we may also receive performance based incentive fees from hedge funds or other structured investments that we manage 
we recognize pia revenue monthly on a month rolling performance basis 
the monthly pia and annual performance fees for structured investments are recognized as revenue at the time the performance fee is finalized or no longer subject to adjustment 
the pia is finalized on a monthly basis 
all other performance fees are based on a full contract year and are final at the end of the contract year 
any performance fees received are not subject to repayment or any other clawback provisions and approximately of managed assets as of december  are subject to high water marks whereby we will not earn incentive fees even if the fund has positive returns until it surpasses the previous high water mark 
employee benefit plan and institutional investment management and administration services fees are negotiated and are also generally based on underlying asset values 
fees from financial planning and advice services are recognized when the financial plan is delivered 
distribution fees distribution fees primarily include point of sale fees such as mutual fund front end sales loads and asset based fees such as b distribution and shareholder service fees that are generally based on a contractual percentage of assets and recognized when earned 
distribution fees also include amounts received under marketing support arrangements for sales of mutual funds and other companies products  such as through our wrap accounts  as well as surrender charges on fixed and variable universal life insurance and annuities 
net investment income net investment income primarily includes interest income on fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale  commercial mortgage loans  policy loans  consumer loans  other investments and cash and cash equivalents  the changes in fair value of trading securities  including seed money  and certain derivatives  the pro rata share of net income or loss on equity method investments  and realized gains and losses on the sale of securities and charges for other than temporary impairments of investments related to credit loss 
interest income is accrued as earned using the effective interest method  which makes an adjustment of the yield for security premiums and discounts on all performing fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale  excluding structured securities  and commercial mortgage loans so that the related security or loan recognizes a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance throughout its term 
for beneficial interests in structured securities  the excess cash flows attributable to a beneficial interest over the initial investment are recognized as interest income over the life of the beneficial interest using the effective yield method 
realized gains and losses on securities  other than trading securities and equity method investments  are recognized using the specific identification method on a trade date basis

distribution expenses distribution expenses primarily include compensation paid to our financial advisors  registered representatives  third party distributors and wholesalers  net of amounts capitalized and amortized as part of dac 
the amounts capitalized and amortized are based on actual distribution costs 
the majority of these costs  such as advisor and wholesaler compensation  vary directly with the level of sales 
distribution expenses also include marketing support and other distribution and administration related payments made to affiliated and unaffiliated distributors of products provided by our affiliates 
the majority of these expenses vary with the level of sales  or assets held  by these distributors  and the remainder is fixed 
distribution expenses also include wholesaling costs 
interest credited to fixed accounts interest credited to fixed accounts represents amounts earned by contractholders and policyholders on fixed account values associated with fixed and variable universal life and annuity contracts

benefits  claims  losses and settlement expenses benefits  claims  losses and settlement expenses consist of amounts paid and changes in liabilities held for anticipated future benefit payments under insurance policies and annuity contracts  along with costs to process and pay such amounts 
amounts are net of benefit payments recovered or expected to be recovered under reinsurance contracts 
benefits under variable annuity guarantees include the changes in fair value of gmwb and gmab embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging these benefits  as well as the changes in fair value of derivatives hedging gmdb provisions 
benefits  claims  losses and settlement expenses also include amortization of dsic 
amortization of dac direct sales commissions and other costs capitalized as dac are amortized over time 
for annuity and universal life contracts  dac are amortized based on projections of estimated gross profits over amortization periods equal to the approximate life of the business 
for other insurance products  dac are generally amortized as a percentage of premiums over amortization periods equal to the premium paying period 
for certain mutual fund products  dac are generally amortized over fixed periods on a straight line basis adjusted for redemptions

fair value measurements we report certain assets and liabilities at fair value  specifically  separate account assets  derivatives  embedded derivatives  properties held by our consolidated property funds  and most investments and cash equivalents 
fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions 
companies are not permitted to use market prices that are the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale 
we include actual market prices  or observable inputs  in our fair value measurements to the extent available 
broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available 
we validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as price variance analysis  subsequent sales testing  stale price review  price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors 
inactive markets through our own experience transacting in the marketplace and through discussions with our pricing vendors  we believe that the market for non agency residential mortgage backed securities is inactive 
indicators of inactive markets include pricing services reliance on brokers or discounted cash flow analyses to provide prices  an increase in the disparity between prices provided by different pricing services for the same security  unreasonably large bid offer spreads and a significant decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels 
in certain cases  this market inactivity has resulted in our applying valuation techniques that rely more on an income approach annual report 
table of contents discounted cash flows using market rates than on a market approach prices from pricing services 
we consider market observable yields for other asset classes we consider to be of similar risk which includes nonperformance and liquidity for individual securities to set the discount rate for applying the income approach to certain non agency residential mortgage backed securities 
the discount rates used for these securities at december  ranged from to 
non agency residential mortgage backed securities backed by sub prime  alt a or prime collateral sub prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with weak credit profiles 
alt a mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers who have credit ratings above sub prime but may not conform to government sponsored standards 
prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with good credit profiles 
we have exposure to these types of loans predominantly through mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
the slow down in the us housing market  combined with relaxed underwriting standards by some originators  has led to higher delinquency and loss rates for some of these investments 
market conditions have increased the likelihood of other than temporary impairments for certain non agency residential mortgage backed securities 
as a part of our risk management process  an internal rating system is used in conjunction with market data as the basis of analysis to assess the likelihood that we will not receive all contractual principal and interest payments for these investments 
for the investments that are more at risk for impairment  we perform our own assessment of projected cash flows incorporating assumptions about default rates  prepayment speeds  loss severity  and geographic concentrations to determine if an other than temporary impairment should be recognized

total exposure to subordinate tranches was nil as of december  fair value of liabilities and nonperformance risk companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant an exit price 
since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders  we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price 
as a result  we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders by updating certain contractholder assumptions  adding explicit margins to provide for profit  risk and expenses  and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk 
the nonperformance risk adjustment is based on broker quotes for credit default swaps that are adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities 
consistent with general market conditions  this estimate resulted in a spread over the libor swap curve as of december  as our estimate of this spread widens or tightens  the liability will decrease or increase 
if this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the libor swap curve  the reduction to net income would be approximately million  net of dac and dsic amortization and income taxes  based on december  credit spreads

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate  equity price  foreign currency and credit risk are the market risks to which we have material exposure 
equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations  primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset based fees we earn  the spread income generated on our annuities  banking  and face amount certificate products and ul insurance products  the value of dac and dsic assets associated with variable annuity and variable ul products  the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits 
the guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities are guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits gmwb  guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits gmab  guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb and guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib options 
each of these guaranteed benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying investment assets 
we continue to utilize a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities 
this approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result 
this program can generally be described as a static greek hedging program 
this style of hedging focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of the assets and liabilities  equity market level delta  interest rate level rho and volatility vega 
additionally  various second order sensitivities are managed 
we use various index options across the term structure  interest rate swaps and swaptions  total return swaps and futures to manage the risk exposures 
the exposures are measured and monitored daily  and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary 
to evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a month period following a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical decline in equity prices 
the interest rate risk test assumes a sudden basis point parallel shift in the yield curve  with rates then staying at those levels for the next months 
the equity price risk test assumes a sudden drop in equity prices  with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next months 
in estimating the values of variable annuity riders  equity indexed annuities  stock market certificates and the associated hedge assets  we assumed no change in implied market volatility despite the drop in equity prices 
annual report 
table of contents the following table presents our estimate of the pretax impact of these hypothetical market moves  net of hedging  as of december  equity price exposure to pretax income equity price decline before hedge impact hedge impact net impact in millions asset based management and distribution fees dac and dsic amortization variable annuity riders gmdb and gmib gmwb gmab dac and dsic amortization n a n a total variable annuity riders equity indexed annuities stock market certificates total interest rate exposure to pretax income interest rate increase basis points before hedge impact hedge impact net impact in millions asset based management and distribution fees variable annuity riders gmwb gmab dac and dsic amortization n a n a total variable annuity riders fixed annuities  fixed portion of variable annuities and fixed insurance products flexible savings and other fixed rate savings products total n a not applicable 
market impact on dac and dsic amortization resulting from lower projected profits 
market impact on dac and dsic amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact 
the above results compare to estimated negative impacts to pretax income of million related to a equity price decline and million related to a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  the reduced equity impact in is a result of market dislocation in and changes to our valuation models 
the discount rates and credit spreads we used in to value certain of our investments were negatively impacted by the market  which led to greater pretax loss projections related to our variable annuity riders  partially offset by a lower impact to our asset based management and distribution fees  primarily as a result of lower asset values 
in evaluating equity price risk  the estimated impact on dac and dsic amortization resulting from lower projected profits as a result of the equity price decline is shown separately from the estimated impact on dac and dsic amortization resulting from changes in the values of gmwb and gmab riders net of hedges 
in estimating the impact on dac and dsic amortization resulting from lower projected profits  we have not changed our assumed equity asset growth rates 
this is a significantly more conservative estimate than if we assumed management follows its mean reversion guideline and increased near term rates to recover the drop in equity values over a five year annual report 
table of contents period 
see critical accounting policies for additional discussion on our dac and dsic accounting policies 
we make this same conservative assumption in estimating the impact from gmdb and gmib riders 
net impacts shown in the above table from gmwb and gmab riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis 
liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles  with key policyholder behavior assumptions loaded to provide risk margins and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities 
management has elected to hedge based on best estimate policyholder assumptions and explicitly does not hedge nonperformance spread risk 
net impacts shown in the above table from gmdb and gmib reflect the fact that these guaranteed benefits are primarily retained by us and not hedged 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a limited number of derivative contracts to economically hedge equity exposure related to gmdb provisions on variable annuity contracts written previously in actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions 
these include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity values fall by  that management does not increase assumed equity asset growth rates to anticipate recovery of the drop in equity values when valuing dac  dsic and gmdb and gmib liability values and that the basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve 
furthermore  we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior  nor have we tried to anticipate actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios 
the selection of a basis point interest rate increase as well as a equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events 
impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a basis point increase in interest rates or a decline in equity prices 
asset based management and distribution fees we earn asset based management fees on our owned separate account assets and certain of our managed assets 
at december   the value of these assets was billion and billion  respectively 
we also earn distribution fees on our managed assets 
these sources of revenue are subject to both interest rate and equity price risk since the value of these assets and the fees they earn fluctuate inversely with interest rates and directly with equity prices 
we do not currently hedge the interest rate or equity price risk of this exposure 
dac and dsic amortization for annuity and universal life products  dac and dsic are amortized on the basis of estimated gross profits 
estimated gross profits are a proxy for pretax income prior to the recognition of dac and dsic amortization expense 
when events occur that reduce or increase current period estimated gross profits  dac and dsic amortization expense is typically reduced or increased as well  somewhat mitigating the impact of the event on pretax income 
variable annuity riders the total value of all variable annuity contracts has increased from billion at december  to billion at december  these contract values include gmwb and gmab contracts which have increased from billion and billion  respectively  at december  to billion and billion at december   respectively 
at december   reserves for gmwb and gmab were million and million  respectively  compared to reserves of billion and million at december   respectively 
the decrease in reserves for gmwb and gmab reflect the changes in economic factors impacting the mark to market value of the guarantees 
at december   the reserve for the other variable annuity guaranteed benefits  gmdb and gmib  was million compared to million at december  equity price risk variable annuity riders the variable annuity guaranteed benefits guarantee payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the investment assets 
for this reason  when equity prices decline  the returns from the separate account assets coupled with guaranteed benefit fees from annuity holders may not be sufficient to fund expected payouts 
in that case  reserves must be increased with a negative impact to earnings 
the core derivative instruments with which we hedge the equity price risk of our gmwb and gmab provisions are longer dated put and call derivatives  these core instruments are supplemented with equity futures and total return swaps 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a limited number of derivative contracts to economically hedge equity exposure related to gmdb provisions on variable annual report 
table of contents annuity contracts written previously in see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative instruments 
interest rate risk variable annuity riders the gmab and the non life contingent benefits associated with the gmwb provisions create embedded derivatives which are carried at fair value separately from the underlying host variable annuity contract 
changes in the fair value of the gmwb and gmab liabilities are recorded through earnings with fair value calculated based on projected  discounted cash flows over the life of the contract  including projected  discounted benefits and fees 
increases in interest rates reduce the fair value of the gmwb and gmab liabilities 
the gmwb and gmab interest rate exposure is hedged with a portfolio of longer dated put and call derivatives  interest rate swaps and swaptions 
these derivatives are an alternative to the more customized equity puts we previously used 
we have entered into interest rate swaps according to risk exposures along maturities  thus creating both fixed rate payor and variable rate payor terms 
if interest rates were to increase  we would have to pay more to the swap counterparty  and the fair value of our equity puts would decrease  resulting in a negative impact to our pretax income 
fixed annuities  fixed portion of variable annuities and fixed insurance products interest rate exposures arise primarily with respect to the fixed account portion of annuity and insurance products of riversource life companies and their investment portfolios 
we guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products 
premiums and deposits collected from clients are primarily invested in fixed rate securities to fund the client credited rate with the spread between the rate earned from investments and the rate credited to clients recorded as earned income 
client liabilities and investment assets generally differ as it relates to basis  repricing or maturity characteristics 
rates credited to clients accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments 
therefore  in an increasing rate environment  higher interest rates are reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets resulting in a reduced spread between the two rates  reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income 
of the billion in future policy benefits and claims on our consolidated balance sheet at december   billion related to liabilities created by these products 
we do not hedge this exposure 
flexible savings and other fixed rate savings products we have interest rate risk from our flexible savings and other fixed rate savings products 
these products are primarily investment certificates generally ranging in amounts from  to million with terms ranging from three to months  as well as other savings products sold through ameriprise bank 
we guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products 
payments collected from clients are primarily invested in fixed rate securities to fund the client credited rate with the spread between the rate earned from investments and the rate credited to clients recorded as earned income 
client liabilities and investment assets generally differ as it relates to basis  repricing or maturity characteristics 
rates credited to clients generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on underlying investments 
this exposure is not currently hedged although we monitor our investment strategy and make modifications based on our changing liabilities and the expected rate environment 
of the billion in customer deposits at december   billion related to reserves for our fixed rate certificate products and billion related to reserves for our banking products 
equity indexed annuities our equity indexed annuity product is a single premium annuity issued with an initial term of seven years 
the annuity guarantees the contractholder a minimum return of on of the initial premium or end of prior term accumulation value upon renewal plus a return that is linked to the performance of the s p index 
the equity linked return is based on a participation rate initially set at between and of the s p index  which is guaranteed for the initial seven year term when the contract is held to full term 
at december   we had million in reserves related to equity indexed annuities 
in  we discontinued new sales of equity indexed annuities 
equity price risk equity indexed annuities the equity linked return to investors creates equity price risk as the amount credited depends on changes in equity prices 
to hedge this exposure  a portion of the proceeds from the sale of equity indexed annuities is used to purchase futures  calls and puts which generate returns to replicate what we must credit to client accounts 
in conjunction with purchasing puts we also write puts 
pairing purchased puts with written puts allows us to better match the characteristics of the liability 
annual report 
table of contents interest rate risk equity indexed annuities most of the proceeds from the sale of equity indexed annuities are invested in fixed income securities with the return on those investments intended to fund the guarantee 
we earn income from the difference between the return earned on invested assets and the guarantee rate credited to customer accounts 
the spread between return earned and amount credited is affected by changes in interest rates 
stock market certificates stock market certificates are purchased for amounts generally from  to million for terms of weeks which can be extended to a maximum of years 
for each term the certificate holder can choose to participate in any percentage increase in the s p index up to a maximum return or choose partial participation in any increase in the s p index plus a fixed rate of interest guaranteed in advance 
if partial participation is selected  the total of equity linked return and guaranteed rate of interest cannot exceed the maximum return 
reserves for our stock market certificates are included in customer deposits on our consolidated balance sheets 
at december   we had million in reserves related to stock market certificates 
equity price risk stock market certificates as with the equity indexed annuities  the equity linked return to investors creates equity price risk exposure 
we seek to minimize this exposure with purchased futures and call spreads that replicate what we must credit to client accounts 
interest rate risk stock market certificates stock market certificates have some interest rate risk as changes in interest rates affect the fair value of the payout to be made to the certificate holder 
this risk continues to be fully hedged 
foreign currency risk we have foreign currency risk through our net investment in foreign subsidiaries and our operations in foreign countries 
we are primarily exposed to changes in british pounds gbp related to our net investment in threadneedle  which had million gbp exposure at december  our primary exposure related to operations in foreign countries is to the gbp and the indian rupee 
we monitor the foreign exchange rates that we have exposure to and enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risk when economically prudent 
at december   the notional value of outstanding contracts and our remaining foreign currency risk related to operations in foreign countries were not material 
interest rate risk on external debt the stated interest rate on the billion of our senior unsecured notes is fixed and the stated interest rate on the million of junior notes is fixed until june  in january  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert the fixed interest rate on billion of the senior unsecured notes to floating interest rates based on six month libor 
as a result  we are exposed to interest rate risk on this debt 
we also have floating rate debt of million related to our municipal bond inverse floater certificates and million related to certain consolidated property funds  a portion of which is hedged using interest rate swaps which effectively convert the floating rates to fixed rates 
the remaining interest rate risk on this debt is not material 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk within our investment portfolio  including our loan portfolio  and through our derivative and reinsurance activities 
credit risk relates to the uncertainty of an obligor s continued ability to make timely payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the financial instrument or contract 
we consider our total potential credit exposure to each counterparty and its affiliates to ensure compliance with pre established credit guidelines at the time we enter into a transaction which would potentially increase our credit risk 
these guidelines and oversight of credit risk are managed through a comprehensive enterprise risk management program that includes members of senior management 
we manage the risk of credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties by applying disciplined fundamental credit analysis and underwriting standards  prudently limiting exposures to lower quality  higher yielding investments  and diversifying exposures by issuer  industry  region and underlying investment type 
we remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long term historical average used in pricing 
annual report 
table of contents we manage our credit risk related to over the counter derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy counterparties  maintaining collateral arrangements and through the use of master netting arrangements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty to another at each due date and upon termination 
generally  our current credit exposure on over the counter derivative contracts is limited to a derivative counterparty s net positive fair value of derivative contracts after taking into consideration the existence of netting arrangements and any collateral received 
this exposure is monitored and managed to an acceptable threshold level 
because exchange traded futures are effected through regulated exchanges and positions are marked to market and generally cash settled on a daily basis  we have minimal exposure to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such derivative instruments 
we manage our credit risk related to reinsurance treaties by evaluating the financial condition of reinsurance counterparties prior to entering into new reinsurance treaties 
in addition  we regularly evaluate their financial strength during the terms of the treaties 
as of december   our largest reinsurance credit risk is related to a long term care coinsurance treaty with a life insurance subsidiary of genworth financial  inc see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on reinsurance
