item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition of the company and on its results of operations during   and this discussion and analysis is intended to highlight and supplement information presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in item critical accounting policies certain critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the accounting principles we follow and the methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and general banking practices 
our most critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for loan losses  which reflects the estimated losses resulting from the inability of its borrowers to make loan payments 
if the financial condition of our borrowers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  t he estimates would be updated and additional provisions for loan losses may be required 
see asset quality allowance for loan losses 
another of our critical accounting policies relates to goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if deemed necessary 
if the fair value of an asset exceeds the carrying amount of the asset  no charge to goodwill is made 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset  goodwill will be adjusted through a charge to earnings 
as part of our compensation program  we provide stock based compensation 
compliance with accounting for stock based compensation requires that we make assumptions including stock price volatility and employee turnover that are utilized to measure compensation expense 
the fair value of stock options granted is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
given the current instability of the economic environment  it is reasonably possible that the methodology of the assessment of potential loan losses  goodwill impairment  and other fair value measurements could change in the near term or could result in impairment going forward 
overview we are a bank holding company  headquartered in lafayette  louisiana  that through our community banking subsidiary  midsouth bank  na  operated offices in south louisiana and southeast texas 
we had approximately million in consolidated assets as of december  we derive the majority of our income from interest received on our loans and investments 
our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits  on which we pay interest 
approximately of our total deposits are interest bearing 
consequently  one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income  or the difference between the income on our interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the expense on our interest bearing liab ilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  which is called our net interest spread 
there are risks inherent in all loans  so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
we maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings for each period 
we have included a detailed discussion of this process  as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses 
our financial performance for the years ended december  and were  and continue to be  significantly impacted by the disruptions in the national economy and the resulting financial uncertainty that has severely impacted the banking industry 
while we believe our market areas have faired better than the national economy during this most recent economic downturn  the economic uncertainty and difficult re al estate markets had an impact on our loan losses  loan demand and our interest rate spread 

table of contents in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments  we earn income through fees and other charges to our customers 
we have also included a discussion of the various components of this noninterest income  as well as of our noninterest expense 
we plan to continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions  including potential expansion into new market areas 
to support our growth  in december  we completed a public offering of approximately million shares of our common stock for which we received net proceeds of approximately million including shares issued upon the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option in january 
as a result of the offering  we were also able to cut in half the number of shares underlying the warrants we issued to the treasury as part of the cpp transaction 
we believe our current financial condition  coupled with our scalable operational capabilities will allow us to act upon growth opportunities afforded within the current banking environment 
the following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the financial statements accompanying or incorporated by reference in this report 
we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the other statistical information included and incorporated by reference in this report 
results of operations net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
dividends recorded on our series a preferred stock reduced net earnings available to common shareholders by  for the year ended december  basic earnings per share were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share were for the year ended december   compared to per share earned for the year ended december  total consolidated assets increased million  or  from million at december   to million at december  the increase in assets resulted primarily from our public offering of million shares of our common stock at per share which closed on december  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
subsequent to december   the underwriters exercised the over allotment option granted to them in the offering  resulting in the issuance of an additional  shares and net proceeds of approximately million 
we plan to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes including  as discussed above  potential acquisition opportunities 
the additional capital increased our leverage capital ratio from 
at december  to at december  tier risk weighted capital and total risk weighted capital ratios were and at december   compared to and at december   respectively

deposits totaled million as of december   an increase of million  compared to million on december  total loans were million  a decrease of million  or  from the million reported as of december  loans decreased throughout as commercial customers used cash flows to pay down debt and continued economic concerns stemmed loan production in both commercial and retail credits 
net earnings before dividends on series a preferred stock decreased  from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to a  increase in our provision for loan losses 
the increase in provision expense was primarily driven by a million increase in net charge offs in  which included million charged off on a national participation credit 
although our total loans decreased  net interest income increased  as deposit rate reductions throughout lowered interest expense and offset the decreased interest income from earning assets 
non interest income decreased  in annual comparison 
increases of  in atm and debit card income and  in service charges on deposit accounts were partially offset by a  decrease in other noninterest income 
the  decrease resulted primarily from a  impairment charge on an equity security  a  decrease in income from a third party investment advisory firm and a  one time payment recorded in other non interest income in the one time payment resulted from visa s mandatory redemption of a portion of its class b shares outstanding in connection with its initial public offering 

table of contents non interest expense increased  in year to date comparison 
salary and benefits costs increased  and occupancy expenses increased  included in other noninterest expense  a  increase in fdic premiums was offset by significant decreases of  in marketing costs   in corporate developmentand training expenses   in professional fees  and  in expenses recorded in related to the data conversion and merger of our former texas bank charter into our louisiana charter 
income tax expense decreased  due to the effect of certain federal tax credits combined with lower annual pre tax profits and sustained tax exempt income levels

changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities combined with changes in market rates of interest greatly affect net interest income 
our net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis  which is net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets  was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
tables and analyze the changes in net interest income in the years ended december    and during  securities in our investment portfolio that have matured have generally been replaced by new securities that  as a result of the current interest rate environment  pay us a lower yield compared to the matured securities they are replacing 
as a result  during we experienced some contraction in our net interest margin and expect to continue to experience additional contraction into however  because of our base of core deposits described below under funding sources deposits  we expect our net interest margin to remain strong

of the million growth in  million was in real estate loans secured by mortgages 
the real estate loan growth consisted primarily of commercial credits that have ten to fifteen year amortization terms with rates fixed primarily for three years  but up to five years 
we believe the short term structure of these real estate mortgage credits allows greater flexibility in controlling interest rate risk 
the commercial portfolio  including financial and agricultural loans  decreased million in the installment loan portfolio decreased million in total real estate construction loans decreased million  a portion of which reflected interim construction loan balances converted to permanent financing within the real estate mortgage loan portfolio  which increased million 
the loan portfolio at december  consisted of approximately in fixed rate loans  with the majority maturing within five years

table of contents we have maintained our credit policy and underwriting procedures and have not relaxed these procedures to stimulate loan growth 
completed loan applications  credit bureau reports  financial statements  and a committee approval process remain a part of credit decisions 
documentation of the loan decision process is required on each credit application  whether approved or denied  to insure thorough and consistent procedures 
asset quality credit risk management we manage credit risk by observing written  board approved policies that govern all underwriting activities 
the risk management program requires that each individual loan officer review his or her portfolio on a quarterly basis and assign recommended credit ratings on each loan 
these efforts are supplemented by independent reviews performed by the loan review officer and other validations performed by the internal audit department 
the results of the reviews are reported directly to the audit committee of the board of directors 
additionally  bank concentrations are monitored and reported quarterly whereby individual customer and aggregate industry leverage  profitability  risk rating distributions  and liquidity are evaluated for each major standard industry classification segment 
 at december   we identified two industry segment concentrations that aggregate more than of our loan portfolio 
the oil and gas industry  including related service and manufacturing industries  totaled approximately million  or and the commercial real estate segment  the majority of which is owner occupied real estate  represented approximately million  or  of the total loan portfolio

our policies provide that retail consumer loans that become days delinquent be routinely charged off 
loans classified for regulatory purposes but not included in table do not represent material amounts that we have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with loan repayment terms 
allowance for loan losses provisions totaling   and  for the years   and  respectively  were considered necessary to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level we believe sufficient to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio

the allowance is comprised of specific reserves assigned to each impaired loan for which probable loss has been identified as well as general reserves to maintain the allowance at an acceptable level for other loans in the portfolio where historical loss experience is available that indicates certain probable losses may exist 
factors considered in determining provisions include estimated losses in significant credits  known deterioration in concentrations of credit  historical loss experience  trends in nonperforming assets  volume  maturity and composition of the loan portfolio  off balance sheet credit risk  lending policies and control systems  national and local economic conditions  the expe rience  ability and depth of lending management  and the results of examinations of the loan portfolio by regulatory agencies and others 
the processes by which we determine the appropriate level of the allowance  and the corresponding provision for probable credit losses  involves considerable judgment  therefore  no assurance can be given that future losses will not vary from current estimates

table of contents capital as described under supervision and regulation  we are required to maintain certain minimum capital levels for the company and the bank 
risk based capital requirements are intended to make regulatory capital more sensitive to the risk profile of an institution s assets

the net unrealized gains and losses reported for december  and  however  did affect the equity to assets ratio for financial reporting purposes 
the ratio of equity to assets was at december  and at december interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity is the sensitivity of net interest income and economic value of equity to changes in market rates of interest 
during  we utilized a qualified third party s model of asset and liability management 
the third party utilizes its own proprietary software to model our assets and liabilities  combined with another qualified third party s system to analyze the investment portfolio 
the model captures data from our internal operating systems and additional information regarding rates and prepayment characteristics to construct an analysis that presents differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for selected time periods 
the analysis also factors in repricing characteristics and cash flows from payments received o n loans and investments

the results of the simulations are reviewed quarterly and discussed at funds management committee meetings of our board of directors 
we do not invest in derivatives and have none in our securities portfolio 
liquidity bank liquidity liquidity is the availability of funds to meet maturing contractual obligations and to fund operations 
the bank s primary liquidity needs involve its ability to accommodate customers demands for deposit withdrawals as well as customers requests for credit 
liquidity is deemed adequate when sufficient cash to meet these needs can be promptly raised at a reasonable cost to the bank 
liquidity is provided primarily by three sources a stable base of funding sources  an adequate level of assets that can be readily converted into cash  and borrowing lines with correspondent banks 
our core deposits are our most stable and important source of funding
