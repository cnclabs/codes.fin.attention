item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the consolidated financial statements include wayne savings bancshares  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  wayne savings community bank 
intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s net income is primarily dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on its loan  mortgage backed securities and investment portfolios  and its cost of funds consisting of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the company s net income also is affected by its provision for loan losses  as well as the amount of noninterest income  including trust income  deposit service charges and gain on the sale of loans into the secondary market  and noninterest expense  such as salaries and employee benefits  federal deposit insurance premiums  occupancy and equipment costs  and income taxes 
earnings of the company also are affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities as more fully described under risk factors above 
business strategy the company s current business strategy is to operate a well capitalized  profitable and community oriented bank dedicated to providing quality service and products to its customers 
the company has sought to implement this strategy in recent years by closely monitoring the needs of customers and providing personal  quality customer service  continuing the origination of a wide array of loan products in the company s market area  managing interest rate risk exposure by better matching asset and liability maturities and rates  increasing fee income  including the continuing growth of the trust department and participation in the secondary mortgage market  managing asset quality  maintaining a strong retail deposit base  maintaining capital in excess of regulatory minimum requirements  and emphasizing the commercial loan program to add high quality  higher yielding and shorter duration assets to the company s loan portfolio 
discussion of financial condition changes from march  to march in addition to the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
economic circumstances  the company s operations  and actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed herein but also include changes in the economy and interest rates in the nation and the company s general market area 
the forward looking statements contained herein include  but are not limited to  those with respect to the following matters management s determination of the amount and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the effect of changes in interest rates  management s opinion as to the effects of recent accounting pronouncements on the company s consolidated financial statements  and management s opinion as to the bank s ability to maintain regulatory capital at current levels 
the company considers the allowance for loan losses and related loss provision to be a critical accounting policy 
a detailed discussion as to the application of such policy is set forth in note to the financial statements 

index at march   total assets increased to million from the million total at march  mainly due to increases in cash and due from banks of million  available for sale securities of million  foreclosed assets held for sale of million and prepaid fdic assessment of million  partially offset by a decrease in loans of million 
during the fiscal year ended march   loans receivable decreased million  or  as the bank originated and retained million of loans  received payments of million and transferred million to foreclosed assets held for sale 
rather than reinvest funds from repayments on loans in long term  fixed rate and lower yielding residential loans  management has invested in shorter term mortgage backed securities to limit interest rate risk in the current rate environment 
at march  and  the allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of total loans and million  or  of total loans  respectively 
in determining the amount of the loan loss allowance at any point of time  management and the board systematically determine the risk of loss in the portfolio 
first  delinquent nonresidential  multi family and commercial loans are evaluated for potential impairment in carrying value 
at march   all delinquent nonresidential  multi family and commercial loans were analyzed  with  of the reserve being allocated to these categories of loans 
the largest loan in this category totaled million at march  the second step in determining the allowance for loan losses entails the application of historic loss experience to individual loan types in the portfolio 
in addition to the historic loss percentage  management employs an additional risk percentage tailored to the board s and management s perception of the overall risk in the economy 
finally  to provide additional assurance regarding the validity of the commercial loan risk rating system  management engages a third party loan reviewer who provides independent validation of the bank s loan grading process 
management recorded a million provision for losses on loans for fiscal  an increase of  over the million recorded for the fiscal year ended march   primarily due to the increase in non performing loans and increased charge offs 
goodwill of million is carried on the company s balance sheet as a result of the acquisition of stebbins bancshares in june in accordance with fasb asc  this goodwill is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
during fiscal  the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test from december to its fiscal year end date of march management evaluated the goodwill using an analysis of required measures of value  including the current stock price as an indicator of minority interest value  change of control multiples as a measure of controlling interest value and discounted cash flow analysis as a measure of going concern value and applied a weighting based on appraisal standards to arrive at a valuation conclusion that indicated no impairment at this time 
a prepaid asset of million was created in the third fiscal quarter of due to the fdic imposing a prepaid assessment on all insured institutions  including the company s subsidiary 
the amount of the prepaid premium covered the fourth calendar quarter of and all of calendar years  and and included a deposit growth assumption 
actual deposit insurance premium expense is calculated by the fdic on a quarterly basis  with the expense being charged to the prepaid asset 
any balance remaining in june  will be refunded to the company s subsidiary bank 
deposits totaled million at march   an increase of million  or  from million at march  savings accounts increased by million  or  demand accounts increased million  or  and money market accounts increased million  or  partially offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit of million  or 
the company experienced an increase in low cost liquid deposit accounts as customers chose to keep funds in more liquid types of accounts due to the low level of market interest rates and as management exercised discipline during the period with regard to the pricing of retail certificates 
in general  management attempts to benchmark retail certificate of deposit pricing to the cost of alternate sources of funds  including fhlb advances and brokered deposits 
exceptions are made to defend customer relationships with significant value to the bank while allowing rate sensitive certificate of deposit shoppers to move to other alternatives 

index other short term borrowings decreased by million as a result of a decrease in commercial repurchase agreements by rate sensitive customers  as reduced economic activity appears to be reducing excess cash balances for a number of the company s customers 
advances from the fhlb decreased  from million at march  to million at march  during the period  million in fixed rate and term advances matured and were renewed into million of new fixed rate and term advances maturing in and to extend liability duration for interest rate risk management purposes at a cost lower than attempting to extend liability duration through the acquisition or retention of retail certificates of deposit 
stockholders equity totaled million  an increase of million  or  during the year ended march   due primarily to million in net income for the fiscal year ended march   an increase of  in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the unrealized gains on available for sale securities during fiscal and amortization of the esop shares of  these increases were offset by dividends totaling  for fiscal comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and general net income totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   an increase of  from net income for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income of million partially offset by an increase in the provision for losses on loans of  interest income interest income decreased million or  to million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to fiscal this decrease was mainly due to a decrease in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets to from for the fiscal year ended march   offset by an increase in the average balance of million  or 
the yield decrease was primarily due to the reduction in overall market rates 
these rate decreases have negatively affected the yields earned on the company s interest earning assets and the most immediate decrease is reflected in the yield on interest bearing deposits 
interest income on loans decreased  or  for the year ended march   compared to fiscal  due primarily to a basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on loans outstanding  offset by a million  or  increase in the average balance of loans year over year 
the decrease in the yield was due to the decrease in market interest rates and the corresponding downward impact on new originations 
interest income on securities decreased  or  during fiscal  compared to fiscal  due primarily to a decrease of basis points in the weighted average yield to as compared to  from the comparable period  generally reflecting reinvestment in lower yielding mortgage backed securities as higher yielding securities prepaid or matured  and a decrease of million  or  in the average balance 
interest income on interest earning deposits decreased by  or  for the fiscal year ended march   due primarily to a decrease in the weighted average yield of basis points to  partially offset with an increase in the average balance of million  or 
as previously mentioned  the decrease in the yield was primarily due to the overall decrease in market rates 

index interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year ended march   totaled million  a decrease of million  or  compared to interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in interest expense resulted from a decrease in the weighted average cost of funds of basis points to for fiscal  combined with a decrease of million  or  in the average balance of deposits and borrowings outstanding in fiscal interest expense on deposits totaled million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or  compared to fiscal the decrease in deposit costs resulted from a decrease of basis points in the weighted average cost of deposits to for fiscal  combined with a decrease in the average balance outstanding of million  or 
in addition  as noted earlier  a shift in the composition of deposits from higher cost certificates of deposit to lower cost checking and savings accounts contributed to the decrease in the cost of deposits  along with a general decline in overall market rates 
interest expense on other short term borrowings totaled  for the year ended march   a decrease of  or  from the period  due primarily to a decrease in the weighted average rate of basis points to for the fiscal year ended march the rate decrease  again  was the result of an overall decline in market rates 
interest expense on borrowings totaled million for the year ended march   an increase of  or  from the period  due primarily to an increase in the average balance of million  or  partially offset with a decrease in the weighted average rate of basis points to for the fiscal year ended march  as a result of lower interest rates on renewed advances 
the increase in the average balance was due to increased borrowings to offset the runoff in deposits due to management s strategic pricing strategy that focused on the maintenance of customer relationships while avoiding high cost retail deposits and management s strategy of extending liability duration with advances to mitigate interest rate risk 
net interest income net interest income totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   an increase of million  or  from the amount for fiscal the average interest rate spread increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the net interest margin increased to for fiscal from for the fiscal year ended march  the basis point decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets was more than offset by the basis point decrease in the cost of funds 
as noted earlier  a decrease in overall market interest rates and shift in the composition of deposits from higher cost certificates of deposit to lower cost checking and savings accounts contributed to the decrease in the cost of deposits 
provision for losses on loans the company recorded a provision for losses on loans totaling million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to a provision for losses on loans of million for the fiscal year ended march  at march   all delinquent nonresidential  multi family and commercial loans were analyzed  resulting in a specific valuation reserve allocation of  the increase in the provision expense also reflects an increase in the levels of delinquent loans and management s analysis of economic conditions in the bank s market areas 
in the opinion of management  as of march   the carrying value of all non performing loans as of march   is expected to be realized 

index noninterest income noninterest income  consisting primarily of earnings on bank owned life insurance policies  gains on sale of loans  gains on the sale of securities designated as available for sale  trust income and deposit service fees increased by  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march   from million for the fiscal year ended march   as all categories saw a year over year increase 
the increase was primarily due to an increase of  in the gain on sale of loans and  in gain on the sale of available for sale securities 
there were no sales of securities in fiscal year available for sale securities were sold during fiscal to reduce credit risk exposure associated with private label mortgage backed securities and to reduce interest rate risk associated with callable securities 
as described under item above  management engages in limited sales of newly originated loans to limit the buildup of interest rate risk on the balance sheet and to provide liquidity to accommodate additional refinancing activity 
deposit service fees  charges and other operating income resulted in an increase of  or  over the previous year 
finally  both trust income and earnings on bank owned life insurance were up by  and  respectively  as trust portfolio market values and insurance portfolio yields increased year over year 
noninterest expense noninterest expense increased by  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to the fiscal year ended march  the increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to an increase of  in federal deposit insurance premiums 
during fiscal  the fdic both increased its assessment rate schedule and imposed a special assessment on all insured institutions 
this increase was combined with an increase in salaries and employee benefits of  or  primarily from merit increases and increased employee healthcare costs 
these increases were offset by a decrease in occupancy and equipment expense of  or  as result of decreased depreciation expense as older equipment was fully depreciated and management carefully controlled the purchase of new capital items and reduced data processing costs associated with new equipment and renegotiated data processing contracts 
franchise taxes also decreased  year over year mainly due to a receivable reduction in from an amendment of prior period returns 
federal income taxes federal income tax expense was  for the year ended march   reflecting an increase of  from fiscal primarily due to an increase of  in pre tax income  partially offset by additional tax exempt securities purchased during the year 
the difference in the effective tax rate of from the statutory rate was mainly due to the beneficial effects of income from the cash surrender value of life insurance and other tax exempt obligations 

index average balance sheet the following tables set forth certain information relating to the company s average balance sheet and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods presented 
year ended march  average average average average balance interest rate balance interest rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable  net investment securities interest earning deposits total interest earning assets non interest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities deposits other short term borrowings borrowings total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity net interest income interest rate spread net yield on interest earning assets ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities includes non accrual loan balances 
includes mortgage backed securities designated as available for sale 
includes federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions 
interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net yield on interest earning assets represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 

index rate volume analysis the table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense of the company for the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in average volume changes in average volume multiplied by old rate  and ii changes in rate change in rate multiplied by old average volume 
changes in rate volume changes in rate multiplied by the change in average volume have been allocated proportionately between changes in rate and changes in volume

while scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank manages the pricing of deposits to maintain a desired level of deposits and cost of funds 
in addition  the bank invests excess funds in federal funds and other short term interest earning assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
federal funds sold and other liquid assets outstanding at march  and  amounted to million and million  respectively 
for additional information about cash flows from the company s operating  financing and investing activities  see the statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
a major portion of the bank s liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  which are a product of operating  investing and financing activities 
the primary sources of cash are net income  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds from deposits and advances from the fhlb  and sales of securities 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if the bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate funds internally  borrowing agreements exist with the fhlb  which provide an additional source of funds 
at march   the company had million in outstanding advances from the fhlb 
at march   the company had additional borrowing capacity from the fhlb totaling million based on the bank s one to four family residential mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities  home equity lines of credit  second mortgage loans and multifamily loans 
the bank also has pledged million to secure a line of credit with the federal reserve bank of million 
the bank has the ability to pledge remaining investments and mortgage backed securities of million which would allow the bank the ability to borrow additional funds from the fhlb 

index contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at march  payments due by period less more than than year years years years total in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations advances from the federal home loan bank other short term borrowings certificates of deposit maturities amount of commitments expiring per period commitments to originate loans letters of credit credit card overdraft lines of credit home equity commercial lines of credit one to four family and multi family loans total contractual obligations impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto  presented elsewhere herein  have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management interest rate sensitivity analysis the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that interest earning assets reprice at a different time than interest bearing liabilities 
as part of its effort to monitor and manage interest rate risk  the bank uses the net portfolio value npv methodology adopted by the ots as part of its interest rate sensitivity regulations 
the application of npv methodology illustrates certain aspects of the bank s interest rate risk 
generally  npv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning and other assets and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing and other liabilities 
the application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk as the change in the npv  which would result from a theoretical change in market interest rates 

index asset and liability management interest rate sensitivity analysis continued presented below  as of march  and  is an analysis of the bank s interest rate risk as measured by changes in npv for instantaneous and sustained  and basis point basis point equals 
increases and a and basis point decrease in market interest rates 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the npv approach 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayment on loans and mortgage backed securities and early withdrawal levels from certificates of deposit would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in making the risk calculations 
as of march  net portfolio value change in net portfolio value as of pv of assets interest rates basis points amount change change npv ratio change in thousands bp   bp bp   bp   bp  bp   bp modeling for the basis point decrease has been temporarily discontinued due to the low current rate environment 
as of march  net portfolio value change in net portfolio value as of pv of assets interest rates basis points amount change change npv ratio change in thousands bp   bp bp   bp   bp  bp  bp  the company s policy in recent years had been to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk generally by better matching the maturities of its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
strategies include originating arm loans and other adjustable rate or short term loans  as well as by purchasing short term investments and mortgage backed securities and extending liabilities through promoting cost effective long term retail certificates of deposit or the use of long term fhlb advances 
however  particularly in the current interest rate and credit market environment  borrowers typically prefer fixed rate loans to arm loans 
accordingly  arm loan originations were very limited during the fiscal year ended march  the net effect of this continuing shift in customer preference for longer duration loans and shorter duration deposits has been to expose the company to increased interest rate risk 
the company has an asset liability management committee alco  which is responsible for reviewing the company s asset liability policies 
the committee meets and reports monthly to the board of directors on interest rate risks and trends  as well as liquidity and capital ratios and requirements 
the bank has operated within the framework of its prescribed npv risk range for each of the last three years
