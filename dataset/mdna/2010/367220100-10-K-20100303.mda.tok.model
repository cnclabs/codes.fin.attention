our business strategy is to enhance shareholder value by using technologies new to a specific area to generate and develop high potential exploitation resources in this area 
our principal business is the acquisition of leasehold interests in petroleum and natural gas rights  either directly or indirectly  and the exploitation and development of properties subject to those leases 
we are currently focusing our drilling efforts in the riverbend project located in the unita basin of northeastern utah  targeting the wasatch  mesaverde  blackhawk  mancos  dakota and morrison formations 

table of contents recent developments sale of gathering assets on february   we completed the sale the closing of materially all of the assets the asset sale comprising our gathering system and our evaporative facilities  located in uintah county  utah the gathering assets  to monarch natural gas  llc monarch pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated january  the purchase agreement 
at closing  we received total cash consideration of million from monarch  the entirety of which was used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility defined below 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  simultaneous with closing we entered into i a transition services agreement with monarch pursuant to which we will provide certain services relating to the operation of the gathering assets to monarch for a six month term commencing at closing  ii a gas gathering agreement with monarch pursuant to which we dedicated our natural gas production from all of our utah acreage and monarch will provide gathering  compression and processing services utilizing the gathering assets to us  and iii a salt water disposal services agreement with monarch pursuant to which we may deliver salt water produced by our operations to the evaporative facilities that monarch acquired in the asset sale 
these agreements will result in less revenue and additional costs with an aggregate annual impact  inclusive of a reduction in depreciation expense  of approximately million based on activity 
the purchase agreement is subject to customary post closing terms and conditions for transactions of this size and nature 
acquisition of petro canada on february   we completed the acquisition of certain oil and gas leases and lands the petro canada assets from petro canada resources usa inc  a colorado corporation petro canada  for a purchase price of approximately  subject to customary post closing terms and conditions for transactions of this size and nature 
the sale was made pursuant to a definitive agreement dated february  by and between us and petro canada 
the petro canada assets include one producing well  one shut in well with recompletion potential and  gross and net acres located in utah west of our gate canyon operating area 
we funded this acquisition with cash flow from operating activities 
amendment to credit facility on february   our million revolving credit facility the credit facility was amended to  among other things  incrementally reduce our borrowing base by a fixed amount in connection with certain contemplated asset sales  including the sale of the gathering assets described above  and  effective as of april   to automatically reduce to million  regardless of whether any of the contemplated asset sales were consummated 
effective february   in connection with the consummation of the asset sale and the application of the proceeds therefrom to pay down outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility  we elected to reduce the borrowing base to million effective immediately 
following the million debt repayment  our available credit is approximately million 
resignation of former chief executive officer  appointment of replacement effective january   our former chief executive officer and president  mark erickson  resigned and was replaced by charles crowell as interim chief executive officer and w 
king grant as president 

table of contents impact of current credit markets and commodity prices the severe disruptions in the credit markets and reductions in global economic activity had significant adverse impacts on stock markets and oil and gas related commodity prices  which contributed to a significant decline in our stock price and negatively impacted our future liquidity 
we expect our liquidity will continue to be negatively affected in by the effects of this activity 
the following discussion outlines the potential impacts that reduced commodity prices could have on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
reduced cash flows from operations could impact our ability to fund capital expenditures and meet working capital needs oil and gas prices have declined significantly since historic highs in july to mitigate the impact of lower commodity prices on our cash flows  we entered into commodity derivative instruments for through the first quarter of see note derivatives to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in the event that commodity prices stay depressed or decline further  our cash flows from operations would be reduced even taking into account our commodity derivative instruments for and and may not be sufficient when coupled with available capacity under our credit facility to meet our working capital needs or  in the event of a significant decline in commodity prices  fund our capital expenditure budget 
this could cause us to alter our business plans  including further reducing our exploration and development plans 
we are operating under a preliminary capital budget subject to board approval for of million which will be used primarily for the completion and recompletion projects on our existing wells 
based on current expectations  we intend to fund our budget entirely through cash flow from operations 
consequently  we will monitor spending and cash flow throughout the year and may accelerate or delay investment depending on commodity prices  cash flow expectations and changes in our borrowing capacity 
effective february   our borrowing base under our credit facility was reduced to million from million and as of march   we had million of outstanding borrowings thereunder 
our borrowing base could be further reduced in the future by our lenders 
though we anticipate funding our capital budget of million for through cash flows from operations  an inability to access additional borrowings in excess of our existing million of existing capacity under our credit facility will limit our ability to increase our operating budget and execute on our growth plans 
the maturity of our credit facility and our outstanding million convertible senior notes occur in march and october of  respectively 
the lenders under our credit facility may elect not to extend the maturity of such facility without our having previously refinanced  restructured or repaid the convertible senior notes due accordingly  an inability to refinance  restructure or repay such convertible notes prior to their maturity on terms acceptable to us may impair our ability to execute on future growth plans 
furthermore  the failure to refinance  restructure or repay such convertible notes or our credit facility prior to their maturities may impair our ability to obtain alternate sources of financing 
any refinancing  restructuring or repayment could cause substantial dilution to our stockholders either through the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets 
if we need additional liquidity for future activities  including paying amounts owed in connection with a borrowing base reduction  if any  we may be required to consider several options for raising additional funds  such as selling securities  selling assets or farm outs or similar arrangements  but we may be unable to complete any of these transactions on terms acceptable to us or at all 
any financing obtained through the sale of our equity will likely result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 

table of contents reduced cash flows from operations could result in a default under our credit facility and convertible senior notes due our credit facility contains covenants including those that require us to maintain a current ratio defined as current assets plus unused availability under the credit facility divided by current liabilities excluding the current portion of the credit facility  determined at the end of each quarter  of not less than  and a ratio of senior debt to ebitdax as such term is defined in the credit facility for the most recent four quarters not to be greater than for each fiscal quarter 
in addition  the credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to incur other indebtedness  create liens or sell our assets  pay dividends on our common stock and make certain investments 
as of december   our current and senior debt to ebitdax ratios were and  respectively  and we were in compliance with each of the covenants as of december  sustained or lower oil and natural gas prices and the impact of the sale of our gathering system could reduce our consolidated ebitdax and thus could reduce our ability to maintain existing levels of senior debt or incur additional indebtedness 
any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit facility could result in a default which would  absent a waiver or amendment  require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility 
additionally  should our obligation to repay indebtedness under our credit facility be accelerated  we would be in default under the indenture governing our convertible notes  which would require repayment of the outstanding principal  interest and liquidated damages  if any  on such convertible notes 
to the extent it becomes necessary to address any anticipated covenant compliance issues  we may be required to sell a portion of our assets or issue additional securities  which would be dilutive to our shareholders and may not be on terms acceptable to us 
reduced commodity prices could impact the borrowing base under our credit facility our credit facility limits our borrowings to the borrowing base less our total outstanding letters of credit issued there under 
as of december   we had loans of approximately million outstanding under our credit facility and letters of credit in the amount of approximately  see note credit facility to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
under the terms of our credit facility  our borrowing base is subject to semi annual redetermination by our lenders thereunder the lenders based on their valuation of our proved reserves and their internal criteria 
in addition to such semi annual determinations  our lenders may request one additional borrowing base redetermination between each semi annual calculation 
if our borrowing base is further reduced as a result of a redetermination to a level below our then current outstanding borrowings  we will be required to repay the amount by which such outstanding borrowings exceed the borrowing base within days of notification by the lenders and we will have less or no access to borrowed capital going forward 
if we do not have sufficient funds on hand for repayment  we will be required to seek a waiver or amendment from our lenders  refinance our credit facility or sell assets or additional shares of common stock 
we may not be able to refinance or complete such transactions on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
in the event that we are unable to repay the amount owed within days  we will be in default under the credit facility  and as such the lenders party thereto will have the right to terminate their aggregate commitment under the credit facility and declare our outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable in whole 
an acceleration of the outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility in this manner would additionally constitute an event of default under the indenture governing to our convertible senior notes due the convertible notes 
should an event of default occur and continue under the indenture governing the convertible notes  the convertible notes may be declared immediately due and payable at their principal amount 
table of contents together with accrued interest and liquidated damages  if any 
as such  should we anticipate that we will not be able to repay all amounts owed under the credit facility as a result of the anticipated borrowing base redetermination  we will consider  along with previously discussed refinancing and sales  a sale of our company or our assets as well as a voluntary reorganization in bankruptcy 
additionally  if we are unable to repay amounts owed under the credit facility  we may be forced into an involuntary reorganization in bankruptcy 
reduced commodity prices may result in ceiling test write downs and other impairments as of march   our full cost pool exceeded the ceiling limitation based on oil and gas prices of per barrel and per mcf see note significant accounting policies oil gas properties to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
therefore  impairment expense relating to our ceiling test of  was recorded during the year ended december  we may be required to further write down the carrying value of our gas and oil properties as a result of low gas and oil prices or if there are substantial downward adjustments to the estimated proved reserves  increases in the estimates of development costs or deterioration in the exploration results 
investments in unproved properties are also assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
our evaluation of impairment of unproved properties incorporates our expectations of developing unproved properties given current and forward looking economic conditions and commodity prices 
as discussed above  we reclassified approximately  and  of expiring acreage primarily in utah and california  respectively into proved property 
this reclassification represents the value of the leases that will expire during before we are able to develop them further 
we believe that the majority of our remaining unproved costs will become subject to depletion within the next five years  by proving up reserves relating to the acreage through exploration and development activities  by impairing the acreage that will expire before we can explore or develop it further  or by making decisions that further exploration and development activity will not occur 
reduced commodity prices may impact our ability to produce economically significant or extended price declines may adversely affect the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically 
a reduction in production could result in a shortfall in our expected cash flows and require us to reduce our capital spending or borrow funds to cover any such shortfall 
any of these factors could negatively impact our ability to replace our production and our future rate of growth 
amendments to credit facility our credit facility is available to provide funds for the exploration  development and or acquisition of oil and gas properties  to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
borrowings made under the credit facility are secured by a pledge of the capital stock of the guarantors and mortgages on substantially all of the company s oil and gas properties 
interest on borrowings is payable monthly and principal is due at maturity on march  during may  our credit facility was amended to among other things  i lower our borrowing base to  from  ii increase the interest rate pricing grid  iii amend the definition of libo rate to include a floor of  iv increase the required collateral coverage and the title requirement relating thereto  v require us to engage a financial consultant on or prior to may  and vi permit us to monetize our commodity hedges as described in note of the accompanying financial statements and use the proceeds to pay down a portion of the approximate  deficiency created by the reduced borrowing base 
a special redetermination of our borrowing base on or 
table of contents around june  was also added  in addition to the scheduled redeterminations and special redeterminations available at our request or the request of the lenders party thereto 
during july  the credit facility was amended  among other things  to reschedule the special redetermination of our borrowing base on or about june  to on or about august  during august  the credit facility was further amended  among other things  to increase the interest rate pricing grid by bp for eurodollar based loans and for alternate base rate abr priced loans with respect to any periods in which we have utilized at least of the borrowing base 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility accrues at variable interest rates at either a eurodollar rate or an alternate base rate 
the eurodollar rate is calculated as libor plus an applicable margin that varies from for periods in which we have utilized less than of the borrowing base to for periods in which we have utilized at least of the borrowing base 
the alternate base rate is equal to the sum of i the greater of a the prime rate  b the federal funds effective rate plus and c the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period on such day plus and ii an applicable margin that varies from for periods in which we have utilized less than of the borrowing base to for periods in which we have utilized at least of the borrowing base 
we elect the basis of the interest rate at the time of each borrowing under the credit facility 
however  under certain circumstances  the lenders may require us to use the non elected basis in the event that the elected basis does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost of making such loans 
this amendment also delayed the special redetermination of our borrowing base previously scheduled to occur on or about august   to on or about september  during september  the credit facility was further amended  among other things  to delay indefinitely the special redetermination of our borrowing base previously scheduled to occur on or about september   as discussed above 
on october   the credit facility was further amended  among other things  to reschedule the scheduled mid year redetermination of the borrowing base pursuant to section of the credit facility originally scheduled to occur on or about november  to on or about november  pursuant to the credit facility  should there be a borrowing base deficiency after this scheduled mid year redetermination on or about november   we were permitted days to eliminate such deficiency 
during december  the credit facility was amended  among other things  to revise the definition of redetermination date with respect to scheduled redeterminations for the year ended december  to be on our about may of each year  thereby removing the scheduled redetermination previously scheduled to occur on or about november   and with respect to scheduled redeterminations for the year ended december  to be on our about january  may and november of such year 
with respect to any scheduled redetermination in subsequent years  however  the redetermination date continues to be on or about may and november of each such year 
pursuant to this amendment  should there be a borrowing base deficiency after the scheduled redetermination on or about january  additionally  the credit facility permitted us to terminate the engagement of our financial advisor effective november  during february  the credit facility was amended  among other things  i to remove the scheduled redetermination of our borrowing base on or about january  with the effect that scheduled redeterminations for the year ended december  revert to the regular redetermination schedule of every six months on or about may and november of each year and ii to reduce our borrowing base to million from million in connection with the sale of our gas gathering system and water disposal facilities and the sale of our interest in certain oil and gas properties collectively  the assets 
pursuant to the amendment  the borrowing base would be reduced by a fixed amount upon the 
table of contents consummation of each sale and  effective as of april   would be automatically reduced to million  regardless of whether any of the assets are sold 
this amendment also increased the interest rate pricing grid by basis points for eurodollar based loans and for abr priced loans effective february as of  interest on borrowings under the credit facility accrues at variable interest rates at either a eurodollar rate or an alternate base rate 
the eurodollar rate is calculated as libor plus an applicable margin that  as amended  varies from for periods in which we have utilized less than of the borrowing base to for periods in which we have utilized at least of the borrowing base 
the alternate base rate  as amended  is equal to the sum of i the greater of a the prime rate  b the federal funds effective rate plus and c the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period on such day plus and ii an applicable margin that varies from for periods in which we have utilized less than of the borrowing base to for periods in which we have utilized at least of the borrowing base 
this amendment further provides that if the borrowing base is greater than  on march   then effective on and after such date the interest rate pricing grid will automatically increase an additional by basis points for eurodollar based loans and for abr priced loans 
we elect the basis of the interest rate at the time of each borrowing under the credit facility 
however  under certain circumstances  the lenders may require us to use the non elected basis in the event that the elected basis does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost of making such loans 
additionally  this amendment provided for the release of certain liens relating to the assets that secure our obligations under the credit facility 
effective february   in connection with the consummation of the asset sale and the application of the proceeds therefrom to pay down outstanding borrowings  we elected to reduce the borrowing base to million effective immediately 
following the million debt repayment  our available credit is approximately million

drilling activity during  we reached total depth on gross wells approximately net wells  one of which was in progress at december   in the riverbend area 
we spudded one new well during and upon reaching total depth on this well  we released our remaining drilling rig 
we did not conduct any initial completion operations 
we re entered three gross operated wells net wells to complete pay zones that were behind pipe 
additionally  we performed limited workover operations on certain green river formation oil wells to enhance oil production during the improved oil prices received during the last three quarters of as of december   we operated gross producing wells 
we currently have an inventory of operated wells with up hole recompletion opportunities and two upper mancos wells awaiting initial completion activities 
california projects as of december   we had a leasehold interest in approximately  gross acres  net acres in kern and san luis obispo counties of southern california 
on one of our prospects in kern county  we entered into a farm out agreement with a large exploration and production company who has a considerable california operations presence 
we received a prospect fee and will be carried for a working interest on the initial well and will turn over operations on the prospect to our partner 
the operator has the option to drill a second well in which we will be carried for a working interest 
we currently have entered into agreements and received prospect fees and working interests on three of our california prospects 
in one of our prospects in the san joaquin basin of southern california  exploratory drilling commenced during the fourth quarter of in mid december  total depth of  feet was reached on this non 
table of contents operated well in which we have a carried working interest 
the well encountered oil shows but not in quantities deemed economic to produce and this well was plugged and abandoned 
we did not incur any exploration expense or dry well costs on this well 
we are currently in discussions with the operator to determine how best to proceed in this area 
the operator has approximately days to propose another test well in which we will be carried for a working interest 
summary of capital expenditures the following table summarizes our capital expenditures during by reconciling the cash paid for acquisitions  development and exploration included within the consolidated statement of cash flows in item cash paid for acquisitions  development and exploration cash spent for property costs that were accrued at capital expenditures for projects lease acquisitions and related costs gathering system  facilities and equipment costs drilling  completion and recompletion activity capital expenditures for projects production and reserve information in december  the sec adopted new rules related to modernizing reserve calculation and disclosure requirements for oil and natural gas companies  which became effective prospectively for annual reporting periods ending on or after december  the new rules expand the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include the extraction of saleable hydrocarbons from oil sands  shale  coal beds or other nonrenewable natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas  and activities undertaken with a view to such extraction 
the use of new technologies is now permitted in the determination of proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
other definitions and terms were revised  including the definition of proved reserves  which was revised to indicate that entities must use the average of beginning of the month commodity prices over the preceding month period  rather than the end of period price  when estimating whether reserve quantities are economical to produce 
likewise  the month average price is now used to calculate cost center ceilings for impairment and to compute depreciation  depletion and amortization 
another significant provision of the new rules is a general requirement that  subject to limited exceptions  proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure  which aligns the current oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements with those of the sec 
as of december   we changed our method of determining the quantities of oil and gas reserves which impacted the amount recorded for depreciation  depletion and amortization and the ceiling test calculation for oil and gas properties 
under the new rules  we prepared our oil and gas reserve estimates as of december  using the average  first day of the month price during the month period ending december  in prior years  we used the year end price  therefore  reserve estimates for the year ended december  may not be directly comparable to those presented for prior periods 
see note change in method of determining oil and gas reserves of the accompanying financial statements for further discussion 
the following table

this curtailment as well as normal production declines partially offset our increased production during during our proved reserve quantities decreased by approximately primarily due to the decrease in oil and gas prices used to estimate the reserves from per barrel and per mcf at december  to per barrel and per mcf at december  also contributing to the decrease in reserve quantities was the sale of our interest in four gross producing one net wells during august the revisions of previous estimates during were due primarily to a decrease in the gas price from per mcf at december  to per mcf at december  which caused some of our wells to become uneconomic 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the oil prices from per barrel at december  to per barrel at december  the majority of the revisions of previous estimates during were primarily the result of a decrease in proved undeveloped reserves as the prices of per barrel and per mcf that were used to estimate our reserves caused all of our proved undeveloped reserves to become uneconomic 
the majority of the revisions of previous estimates during were primarily the result of an increase in proved undeveloped reserves due to the increase in oil and gas prices used to estimate the reserves from per barrel and per mcf in to per barrel and per mcf at december

concurrent with the monetization of the hedges  we re hedged a portion of our production for the period june through march the new derivative contracts were entered into at a weighted average price over the contract periods 
we elected the weighted average price scenario for a portion of our natural gas volumes in an effort to secure the best prices for the contract period

table of contents forward sales contracts during april  we entered into a firm sales and transportation agreement to sell up to  mmbtu per day of our and gross production from the uinta basin 
the contract contains two pricing mechanisms up to  mmbtu per day will be priced at the nw rockies first of month price and up to  mmbtu per day will be priced at the first of the month index price as published by gas daily for the north west wyoming poll index price 
we believe that we are not required to treat the contracts as derivatives and the contracts will not be marked to market because we anticipate that we will produce the volumes required to be delivered under the terms of the contracts  it is probable the delivery will be made to the applicable counterparty and the applicable counterparty will fulfill its contractual obligations under the terms of the contracts 
capital budget based on current expectations  we intend to fund our capital expenditure program entirely through cash flow from operations 
this program will focus primarily on completion and recompletion projects on our existing wells 
consequently  we will monitor spending and cash flow throughout the year and may accelerate or delay investment depending on commodity prices  cash flow expectations and changes in our borrowing capacity

effective february   in connection with the consummation of the sale of our gathering assets and the application of the proceeds therefrom to pay down outstanding borrowings  we elected to reduce the borrowing base to million effective immediately 
following the million debt repayment  our available credit is approximately million 
for further discussion of each amendment  see amendments to credit facility in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the credit facility requires us to comply with financial covenants that require us to maintain a current ratio defined as current assets plus unused availability under the credit facility divided by current liabilities excluding the current portion of the credit facility  determined at the end of each quarter  of not less than  and a ratio of senior debt to ebitdax as such terms are defined in the credit facility for the most recent four quarters not to be greater than for each fiscal quarter 
in addition  the credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to incur other indebtedness  create 
table of contents liens or sell our assets  pay dividends on our common stock and make certain investments 
sustained or lower oil and natural gas prices could reduce our consolidated ebitdax and thus could reduce our ability to maintain existing levels of senior debt or incur additional indebtedness 
any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of the credit facility could result in a default which would  absent a waiver or amendment  require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility 
additionally  should our obligation to repay indebtedness under the credit facility be accelerated  we would be in default under the indenture governing the convertible notes  which would require repayment of the outstanding principal  interest and liquidated damages  if any  on such convertible notes 
to the extent it becomes necessary to address any anticipated covenant compliance issues  we will seek to obtain a waiver or amendment of the credit facility from the lenders  and in the event that such waiver or amendment is not granted  we may be required to sell a portion of our assets or issue additional securities  which would be dilutive to our shareholders 
any sale of assets or issuance of additional securities may not be on terms acceptable to us 
as of december   there were loans of  outstanding and letters of credit in the amount of  under the credit facility  which are considered usage for purposes of calculating availability and commitment fees 
as of december   our current and senior debt to ebitdax ratios were and  respectively  and we were in compliance with each of the covenants contained in the credit facility 
convertible notes on october  the issue date  we closed the private placement of  in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the convertible notes pursuant to an indenture dated as of october  the indenture  between us and wells fargo bank  national association  as trustee 
the amount sold consisted of  principal amount originally offered plus the exercise by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase an additional  principal amount 
the convertible notes were sold only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on rule a under the securities act of the convertible notes are convertible into our common stock  
par value per share  at any time prior to maturity at a conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of convertible notes equivalent to a conversion price of per share  which is subject to certain anti dilution adjustments 
interest on the convertible notes accrues from the most recent interest payment date  and is payable in cash semi annually in arrears on april th and october th of each year  and commenced on april  interest is payable to holders of record on march th and september th immediately preceding the related interest payment dates  and will be computed on the basis of a day year consisting of twelve day months 
we may  at our option  at any time on or after october   in whole  and from time to time in part  redeem the convertible notes on not less than nor more than days prior notice mailed to the holders of the convertible notes  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of convertible notes to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the redemption date  if the closing price of the common stock has exceeded of the conversion price for at least trading days in any consecutive trading day period 

table of contents upon a change of control as defined in the indenture  each holder of convertible notes can require us to repurchase all of that holder s notes days after we give notice of the change of control  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of convertible notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to  but not including  the repurchase date  plus a make whole premium under certain circumstances described in the indenture 
the convertible notes are unsecured except as described above and unsubordinated obligations and rank on parity except as described above in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
the convertible notes effectively rank junior to any future secured indebtedness and junior to our subsidiaries liabilities 
the indenture does not contain any financial covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends  the repurchase of our securities or the incurrence of indebtedness 
upon a continuing event of default  the trustee or the holders of principal amount of a series of convertible notes may declare the convertible notes immediately due and payable  except that a default resulting from our entry into a bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization will automatically cause all convertible notes under the indenture to become due and payable 
the fair value of the convertible notes was  as of december   based on market quotes 
derivatives our results of operations and operating cash flows are affected by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
as of december   natural gas derivative instruments were comprised of two swap agreements for through march production 
the fair value of the agreements was a current liability of  and a noncurrent liability of  as of december  the fair value of the agreements was a current asset of  as of december  these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas prices to be received for our economically hedged production 
see further discussion in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the significant accounting policies and related estimates that affect the company s financial disclosures 
oil and gas properties and reserves we follow the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs related to the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into a single cost center referred to as a full cost pool 
depletion of exploration and development costs and depreciation of production equipment is computed using the units of production method based upon estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
under the full cost method of accounting  capitalized oil and gas property costs less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves less the future cash outflows associated 
table of contents with the asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet plus the cost  or estimated fair value if lower  of unproved properties 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  an impairment would be recognized 
under the new rules  we prepared our oil and gas reserve estimates as of december  using the average  first day of the month price during the month period ending december  in prior years through september   we used the year end price 
prior to december   subsequent commodity price increases could be utilized to calculate the ceiling value 
see note change in method of determining oil and gas reserves to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of changes in the ceiling test as of december  as of march   our full cost pool exceeded the ceiling limitation based on oil and gas prices of per barrel and per mcf 
there was no additional impairment recorded for the remainder of therefore  impairment expense of  was recorded during the year ended december  estimated reserve quantities and future net cash flows have the most significant impact on us because these reserve estimates are used in providing a measure of the overall value of our company 
estimated quantities are affected by changes in commodity prices and actual well performance 
these estimates are also used in the quarterly calculations of depletion  depreciation and impairment of our proved properties 
if our reserve quantities change or if additional costs are reclassified from unproved properties into proved properties  depletion expense could be significantly affected 
estimating accumulations of gas and oil is complex and is not exact because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in the process 
the process relies on interpretations of available geological  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the securities and exchange commission sec  such as gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the most accurate method of determining proved reserve estimates is based upon a decline analysis method  which consists of extrapolating future reservoir pressure and production from historical pressure decline and production data 
the accuracy of the decline analysis method generally increases with the length of the production history 
since most of our wells have been producing less than seven years  their production history is relatively short  so other generally less accurate methods such as volumetric analysis and analogy to the production history of wells of other operators in the same reservoir were used in conjunction with the decline analysis method to determine the estimates of our proved reserves including developed producing  developed non producing and undeveloped 
as our wells are produced over time and more data is available  the estimated proved reserves will be redetermined on an annual basis and may be adjusted based on that data 
actual future production  gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable gas and oil reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
for example  a decrease in prices used to estimate our reserve quantities as of december  of per mcf for natural gas and per barrel of oil would result in a decrease in our december  present value of future net cash flows of approximately  in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  acquisitions  divestitures  ownership interest revisions  results of exploration and development and prevailing gas and oil prices 
our reserves may also be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets the cost of our unproved properties is withheld from the depletion base as described above  until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the properties 
these properties are reviewed periodically for possible impairment 
our management reviews all unproved property each quarter 
if a determination is made that acreage will be expiring or that we do not plan to develop some of the acreage that is no longer considered to be prospective  we record an impairment of the acreage and reclassify the costs to the full cost pool 
we estimate the value of these acres for the purpose of recording the related impairment 
the impairments that we have recorded were estimated by calculating a per acre value from the total unproved costs incurred for the applicable acreage divided by the total net acres owned by us 
this per acre estimate is then applied to the acres that we do not plan to develop in order to calculate the impairment 
a change in the estimated value of the acreage could have a material impact on the total impairment recorded by us  calculation of depletion expense and the ceiling test analysis 
during  we reclassified approximately  and  of expiring acreage primarily in utah and california  respectively into proved property 
this reclassification represents the value of the leases that will expire during before we are able to develop them further 
management believes that the current fair value is in excess of the carrying value of the remaining unproved property 
stock based compensation we account for stock option grants and restricted stock awards by recognizing compensation cost for stock based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award 
compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to calculate the fair value of option awards 
this model requires us to estimate a risk free interest rate and the volatility of our common stock price 
the use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense 
derivatives we have entered into certain derivative instruments to provide a measure of stability to our cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and to manage our exposure to commodity price risk 
we record all derivative instruments at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value are to be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we recorded a change in the fair value of derivative instruments of   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   the fair value of the agreements was a current liability of  and a non current liability of  the fair value measurement of these assets and liabilities are measured based upon our valuation model that considers various inputs including a quoted forward prices for commodities  b time value  c notional quantities d current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments and e the counterparty s and our credit ratings 
the unobservable inputs related to the volatility of the oil and gas commodity market are very significant in these calculations 
continued volatility in these markets could have a significant impact on the fair value of our derivative contracts 
see note fair value measurements to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents results of operations compared to oil and gas revenue and production the following table sets forth the production volumes  average sales prices and revenue by product for the periods indicated 
for the years ended december  natural gas production mcf average sales price per mcf natural gas revenue oil production bbl average sales price per bbl oil revenue production mcfe total oil and gas revenue oil and gas revenue decreased  in compared to due to i a decrease in oil and gas production that was primarily the result of normal production declines in existing wells  partially offset by completion activity during and ii a decrease in the average gas price of per mcf and a decrease in the average oil price of per bbl during the  decrease in oil and gas revenue during represents a decrease of  due to a decrease in oil and gas prices and a decrease of  due to a decrease oil and gas production 
gathering revenue and expenses gathering revenue and expense represents the income earned from the third party working interest owners in the wells we operate our share of gathering revenue is netted against the transportation expense included in our lease operating costs and the expenses incurred from the riverbend area pipeline that we constructed during and the gathering income increased by  during as compared with due to less revenue being eliminated as a result of our decreased average working interest in the wells during the decrease in gathering expense of  during is primarily due to decreased operating expenses due to the implementation of cost cutting measures as well as decreased production in rental income rental income during is comprised of the lease payments received from a third party s use of our drilling rig 
rental income is eliminated against the full cost pool when the rig is used to drill our operated wells and rental income is recognized when the rig is used to drill third party wells 
the rig was used for drilling third party wells during the first four months of as the rig was released from its last drilling project during april and was sold during june as further described below 

table of contents lease operating expenses the table below sets forth the detail of oil and gas lease operating expenses during the periods presented 
for the years ended december  direct operating expenses and overhead workover expense total operating expenses operating expenses per mcfe production and property taxes production and property taxes per mcfe total lease operating expense per mcfe lease operating expense decreased  during compared with the decrease is comprised of a  decrease in operating expenses combined with a  decrease in production taxes primarily due to the decrease in natural gas and oil prices during and to the use of severance tax exemptions related to certain of our gas wells 
the decrease in operating expenses is primarily due the implementation of cost savings measures such as the elimination of over time worked by our employees and the elimination of contractor services 
depletion  depreciation and amortization depletion  depreciation and amortization expense is comprised of depletion expense related to our oil and gas properties  depreciation expense of furniture  fixtures and equipment and accretion expense related to the asset retirement obligation 
the decrease of  during compared to is primarily due to the decrease in the full cost pool resulting from a property impairment of  that was recorded during the first quarter of impairment as of march   our full cost pool exceeded the ceiling limitation based on oil and gas prices of per barrel and per mcf 
therefore  an impairment expense of  was recorded for the year ended december  impairment expense during represents a reduction in the fair value of our drilling rig 
based upon an independent appraisal of our drilling rig  we believe that the market value of our drilling rig decreased from its carrying value of  to approximately  as of december  therefore  we recorded an impairment expense of  to reduce the carrying value of the rig during contract termination fee during february  we released our remaining drilling rig and paid the rig contractor  for early termination of the drilling contract  as calculated at  per day from the rig release date through march   the expiration date of the contract 

table of contents loss on sale of assets  net loss on sale of assets  net includes a loss of  on the sale of our drilling rig during june for proceeds of  which consisted of a cash payment of  and an interest bearing promissory note of  that has a maturity date of june  this loss was partially offset by a net gain of  representing the increase in the value of our inventory from when it was originally purchased to when it was transferred to the wells partially offset by losses resulting from a decrease in the market value of certain types of inventory see note significant accounting policies facilities and equipment to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
general and administrative expense the following table summarizes the components of general and administrative expense and stock based compensation expense incurred during the periods presented 
for the years ended december  total general and administrative costs general and administrative costs attributable to drilling  completion and operating activities general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses per mcfe total stock based compensation costs stock based compensation costs capitalized stock based compensation stock based compensation per mcfe total general and administrative expense including stock based compensation total general and administrative expense per mcfe general and administrative expense decreased by  in as compared with the decrease was primarily caused by a  decrease in stock based compensation expense due to certain stock options and restricted stock becoming fully vested and to the cancellation or forfeiture of options and restricted stock during this decrease was offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses of  was primarily due to cost cutting measures that we implemented during the first quarter of partially offset by increased legal fees due to the settlement of a lawsuit further described in note legal proceedings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and increased consulting fees related to the hiring of a financial consultant as required by our lenders 
interest expense interest expense during and consists primarily of interest expense related to our outstanding convertible senior notes which were issued on october  and borrowings under or existing line of credit 
the increase in interest expense of  was primarily due to increased borrowings and increased interest rates under our existing line of credit during 
table of contents derivative gains losses derivative gains were  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
these gains were comprised of realized and unrealized gains and losses on our derivative instruments 
the unrealized derivative gains losses represent the mark to market changes in our derivative assets and liabilities and the realized derivative gains losses represent the net settlements due from or to our counterparties based on each month s settlement during the year 
the change in these gains and losses during as compared with were due to the changes in the gas prices during the same periods 
interest income interest income increased  in compared with primarily due to a higher average cash and cash equivalent balances during compared to oil and gas revenue and production the following table sets forth the production volumes  average sales prices and revenue by product for the periods indicated 
for the years ended december  natural gas production mcf average sales price per mcf natural gas revenue oil production bbl average sales price per bbl oil revenue production mcfe total oil and gas revenue the increase in oil and gas revenue of  in compared to is comprised of a increase in oil and gas production primarily due to the drilling and completion activity during and an increase of per mcf in the average gas price and an increase of per bbl in the average oil price during the production increase during was partially offset by our decision to curtail production on some of our existing wells during the fourth quarter due to low natural gas prices as discussed previously as well as normal production declines on wells drilled during earlier periods 
the  increase in oil and gas revenue during represents an increase of  related to an increase in oil and gas prices and an increase of  related to increased oil and gas production 
gathering revenue and expenses gathering income increased by  in as compared to due to the increased production resulting from our drilling activity in the riverbend area 
the increase in gathering expense of  during is primarily due to the addition of compression in early  as well as increased operating expenses due to the production increase during 
table of contents rental income rental income was comprised of the lease payments received from a third party s use of the company s drilling rig 
rental income is eliminated against the full cost pool when the rig is used to drill company operated wells and rental income is recognized when the rig is used to drill third party wells 
the rig has been used for drilling third party wells only since april the increase in this income during is due to the rig being used on third party wells for all of versus nine months of lease operating expenses the table below sets forth the detail of oil and gas lease operating expenses during the periods presented 
for the years ended december  direct operating expenses and overhead workover expense total operating expenses operating expenses per mcfe production and property taxes production and property taxes per mcfe total lease operating expense per mcfe lease operating expense increased  during compared with the increase was comprised of a  increase in operating expenses and a  increase in production taxes during the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased water disposal costs along with increased chemical treatment costs related to the transition from contract pumpers to company pumpers as older wells were repaired and returned to production 
additionally  the number of producing wells increased from gross wells in to gross wells in depletion  depreciation and amortization the decrease in depletion  depreciation and amortization expense of  during compared with was primarily due to a  reduction in the full cost pool due to the impairments recorded during the second quarter and third quarter of  as described below  which resulted in a lower depletion base partially offset by an impairment of unproved properties and lower quantities of reserves during however  the decline in depletion  depreciation  and amortization resulting from the impairment was partially offset by an increase in oil and gas production and related capital costs resulting from our increased drilling and completion activity discussed above 
impairment impairment expense during represents a reduction in the fair value of our drilling rig 
in light of market conditions and lower commodity prices during  many oil and gas companies cut back on their drilling plans for as a result  the demand for drilling rig services also declined 
based upon an independent appraisal of our drilling rig  we believe that the market value of our drilling rig decreased 
table of contents from its carrying value of  to approximately  as of december  therefore  we recorded impairment expense of  to reduce the carrying value of the rig 
impairment expense of  during represents the impairments recorded as of june  and september  because the present value of our future net revenue discounted at exceeded our full cost pool based on current oil and gas prices 
as of june   oil and gas prices were per barrel and per mcf 
therefore  impairment expense of  was recorded during the quarter ended june  as of september   oil and gas prices were per mcf and per barrel 
our oil and gas reserves became uneconomic as the gas price on september  was less than our gathering costs to transport the gas to a sales point and would have resulted in an impairment of  however  subsequent to september   oil and gas prices increased  and using prices our full cost pool would have exceeded the above described ceiling by  therefore  impairment expense of  was recorded during the quarter ended september  general and administrative expense the following table summarizes the components of general and administrative expense and stock based compensation expense incurred during the periods presented 
for the years ended december  total general and administrative costs general and administrative costs attributable to drilling  completion and operating activities general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses per mcfe total stock based compensation costs stock based compensation costs capitalized stock based compensation stock based compensation per mcfe total general and administrative expense including stock based compensation total general and administrative expense per mcfe general and administrative expense increased by  in as compared with primarily due to increased consulting fees associated with the preparation and analysis of our mid year and year end reserve reports during interest expense the increase in interest expense of  from to was primarily due to increased borrowings under our existing line of credit during 
table of contents derivative gain loss the company began hedging its production in december for and production 
derivative gains  net  during were  the gain was comprised of a realized net gain of  and an unrealized gain of  during the derivative loss during was a noncash expense representing the recording of the fair value of a natural gas swap agreement that was entered into during december interest income interest income decreased  in compared with primarily due to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances during resulting from our investment in oil and gas properties 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb accounting standards codification codification  as the single source of authoritative us gaap for all non governmental entities  with the exception of the sec and its staff 
the codification  which became effective july   changes the referencing and organization of accounting guidance and was effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  we adopted the codification on july  which provides for changes in references to technical accounting literature if used in this annual report on form k and subsequent reports  but did not have a material impact on the our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the accounting and disclosures of subsequent events 
this guidance incorporates the subsequent events guidance contained in the auditing standards literature into authoritative accounting literature 
it also requires entities to disclose the date through which they have evaluated subsequent events and whether the date corresponds with the release of their financial statements 
this guidance was effective for all interim and annual periods ending after june  we adopted this guidance upon its issuance and it had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate subsequent events up to immediately prior to the issuance of its consolidated financial statements  and for purposes of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we have evaluated subsequent events through march   the filing date of this k  and have disclosed such items in note credit facility  note commitments  note legal proceedings and note subsequent events in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued new accounting guidance to provide clarification on measuring liabilities at fair value when a quoted price in an active market is not available 
this guidance became effective for us on october  we adopted this guidance on october   and it had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
please refer to the earlier disclosure for derivatives  note change in method of determining oil and gas reserves and note fair value measurements for additional information on the recent adoption of new authoritative accounting guidance 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we had entered into included undrawn letters of credit  operating lease agreements and gas transportation commitments 
the company does not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect its liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources currently or in the future 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk our results of operations and operating cash flows are affected by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of our exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
as of december   our derivative instruments consisted of two swap agreements for our through march production 
the fair market values of these agreements were a current liability of  and a noncurrent liability of  as of december  these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
our derivative contracts are described below for our swap instruments  we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pays a floating market price to the counterparty 
the fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
our swap agreements for through march are summarized in the table below remaining fixed price floating price a agreement type term quantity counterparty payer gasco payer swap b  mmbtu day mmbtu nw rockies swap  mmbtu day mmbtu nw rockies swap b  mmbtu day mmbtu nw rockies a northwest pipeline rocky mountains inside ferc first of month index price 
b includes information pertaining to a portion of a single natural gas derivative contract with declining volumes 
the fixed price represents the weighted average price for the entire period from june through march the swap contracts allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas prices that we will receive for our hedged production and to benefit from operating cash flows when market prices are less than the fixed prices of the contracts 
however  we will not benefit from market prices that are higher than the fixed prices in the contracts for the hedged production 
our hedging contracts have no requirements for us to post additional collateral based upon the changes in the market value of our hedge instruments 
interest rate risk we do not currently use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure  including under our revolving credit facility  to the volatility in interest rates
