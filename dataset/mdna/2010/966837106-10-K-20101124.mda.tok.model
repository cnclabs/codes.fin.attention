new stores generally become profitable during their first year of operation  although some new stores may incur operating losses for the first several years of operation 
gross profit is typically lower in the first fiscal quarter due to the product mix of holiday sales  and in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the seasonally slower sales period during the summer months 
sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty third full week after the store was opened or acquired 
stores acquired in purchase acquisitions enter the comparable store sales base effective the fifty third full week following the date of the merger
