item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements which accompany this report 
a glossary of insurance terms and phrases is available on the investor section of our website 
throughout the discussion  references to proassurance  pra  we  us and our refer to proassurance corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 
the discussion contains certain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
as discussed under forward looking statements  our actual financial condition and operating results could differ significantly from these forward looking statements 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report on those statements 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on current and historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  reported results of operations may be materially affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions 
management considers the following accounting estimates to be critical because they involve significant judgment by management and the effect of those judgments could result in a material effect on our financial statements 
reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses reserve for losses or reserve the largest component of our liabilities is our reserve for losses  and the largest component of expense for our operations is incurred losses 
incurred losses in any period reflect our estimate of losses incurred related to the premiums earned in that period as well as any changes to our estimates of the reserve established for losses of prior periods 
the estimation of professional liability losses is inherently difficult 
loss costs  even for claims with similar characteristics  can vary significantly depending upon many factors  including but not limited to  the nature of the claim and the personal situation of the claimant or the claimant s family  the outcome of jury trials  the legislative and judicial climate where the insured event occurred  general economic conditions and  for medical professional liability  the trend of health care costs 
professional liability claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time  often five years or more 
the combination of changing conditions and the extended time required for claim resolution results in a loss cost estimation process that requires actuarial skill and the application of judgment  and such estimates require periodic revision 
our reserves are established by management after taking into consideration a variety of factors including premium rates  claims frequency  historical paid and incurred loss development trends  the effect of inflation  general economic trends  the legal and political environment  and the conclusions reached by our internal actuaries 
our internal actuaries perform an in depth review of our reserve for losses on a semi annual basis using the loss and exposure data of our insurance subsidiaries 
in addition  we engage external actuaries to review our data and provide us with their observations regarding our data and the adequacy of our established reserve 
we believe that use of external actuaries provides us with an independent viewpoint regarding our loss experience and a broader perspective on industry loss trends 
we update and review the data underlying the estimation of our reserve for losses each reporting period and make adjustments to loss estimation assumptions that we believe best reflect emerging data 
any adjustments are reflected in the then current operations 
due to the size of our reserve for losses  even a small percentage adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 

table of contents there is a significant risk that actual incurred losses will develop differently from our estimates 
in establishing our initial reserves for a given accident year we rely significantly on the loss assumptions embedded within our pricing 
because of the historically volatile nature of professional liability losses  we establish the initial loss estimates at a level which is approximately to above our pricing assumptions 
this difference recognizes the volatility of the professional liability loss environment and the risk in determining pricing parameters 
as each accident year matures  we analyze reserves in a variety of ways and use multiple actuarial methodologies in performing these analyses  including bornhuetter ferguson paid and reported method paid development method reported development method average paid value method average reported value method backward recursive method the descriptions require some explanation as to how we and actuaries view our reserves and a brief description of each method follows 
we segment our reserves by accident year  which is the year in which the claim becomes our liability 
as claims are incurred reported and claim payments are made  they are aggregated by accident year for analysis purposes 
we also segment our reserves by reserve type case reserves and ibnr reserves 
case reserves are established by our claims department based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimate of the future loss costs often referred to as expected losses that will be paid on reported claims 
case reserves are decremented as claim payments are made and are periodically adjusted upward or downward as claim department estimates regarding the amount of future losses are revised  reported loss is the case reserve at any point in time plus the claim payments that have been made to date 
ibnr reserves represent our estimate of losses that have been incurred but not reported to us  and future developments on losses that have been reported to us 
bornhuetter ferguson method 
we use both the paid and the reported bornhuetter ferguson methods 
the paid method assigns partial weight to initial expected losses for each accident year initial expected losses being the first established case and ibnr reserves for a specific accident year and partial weight to paid to date losses 
the reported method assigns partial weight to the initial expected losses and partial weight to current reported losses 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
paid development and reported development method 
these methods use historical  cumulative losses paid losses for the paid development method  reported losses for the reported development method by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claim payment environment and case reserving environment for the reported development method  and  to the extent necessary  supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
average paid value and average reported value methods 
in these methods  average claim cost data paid claim cost for the average paid value method and reported claim cost for the reported value method is developed to an ultimate average cost level by report year based on historical data 
claim counts are similarly developed to an ultimate count level 
the average claim cost after rounding and adjustment  if necessary  to accommodate report year data that is not considered to be predictive is then multiplied by the ultimate claim counts by report year to derive ultimate loss and alae 
backward recursive development method 
this method is an extrapolation on the movements in case reserve adequacy in order to estimate unpaid loss costs 
historical data showing incremental changes to case reserves over progressive time periods is used to derive factors that represent the ratio of case reserve values at successive maturities 
historical claim payments data showing the additional payments in progressive time periods is used to derive factors that represent the portion of a case reserve paid in the 
table of contents following period 
starting from the most mature period  after which all the case reserve is paid and the case reserve is exhausted  the next prior ultimate development factor for the prior case reserve can be calculated as the case factor times the established ultimate development factor plus the paid factor 
for each successive prior maturity  the ultimate development factor is calculated similarly 
the result of multiplying the ultimate development factor times the case reserve is the total indicated unpaid amount 
generally  methods such as the bornhuetter ferguson method are used on more recent accident years where we have less data on which to base our analysis 
as time progresses and we have an increased amount of data for a given accident year  we begin to give more confidence to the development and average methods  as these methods typically rely more heavily on our own historical data 
each of these methods treats our assumptions differently  and thus provides a different perspective for our reserve review 
the various actuarial methods discussed above are applied in a consistent manner from period to period 
in addition  we perform statistical reviews of claims data such as claim counts  average settlement costs and severity trends 
in performing these analyses we partition our business by coverage type  geography  layer of coverage and accident year 
this procedure is intended to balance the use of the most representative data for each partition  capturing its unique patterns of development and trends 
for each partition  the results of the various methods  along with the supplementary statistical data regarding such factors as the current economic environment  are used to develop a point estimate based upon management s judgment and past experience 
the process of selecting the point estimate from the set of possible outcomes produced by the various actuarial methods is based upon the judgment of management and is not driven by formulaic determination 
for each partition of our business  we select a point estimate with due regard for the age  characteristics and volatility of the partition of the business  the volume of data available for review and past experience with respect to the accuracy of estimates 
this series of selected point estimates is then combined to produce an overall point estimate for ultimate losses 
we have modeled implied reserve ranges around our single point reserve estimates for our professional liability business assuming different confidence levels 
the ranges have been developed by aggregating the expected volatility of losses across partitions of our business to obtain a consolidated distribution of potential reserve outcomes 
the aggregation of this data takes into consideration the correlation among our geographic and specialty mix of business 
the result of the correlation approach to aggregation is that the ranges are narrower than the sum of the ranges determined for each partition 
we have used this modeled statistical distribution to calculate an and confidence interval for the potential outcome of our net reserve for losses 
the high and low end points of the distributions are as follows low end point carried net reserve high end point confidence level billion billion billion confidence level billion billion billion the claims environment in which we and others in our industry operate is inherently uncertain 
the development of a statistical distribution models the uncertainty as well as the limited predictive power of past loss data 
the distributions represent an estimate of the range of possible outcomes and should not be confused with a range of best estimates 
given the number of factors considered  it is neither practical nor meaningful to isolate a particular assumption or parameter of the process and calculate the impact of changing that single item 

table of contents the following table presents additional information about net favorable loss development in thousands net favorable loss development recognized loss development as of beginning of year loss reserves any change in our estimate of losses is reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our reserve for losses  even a small percentage adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made  as has been the case in  and reinsurance we use insurance and reinsurance collectively  reinsurance to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability  to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits  and to stabilize underwriting results in years in which higher losses occur 
the purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies  but it does provide reimbursement for certain losses we pay 
we evaluate each of our ceded reinsurance contracts at inception to determine if there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting guidance 
at december  all ceded contracts are accounted for as risk transferring contracts 
our receivable from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represents our estimate of the amount of our reserve for losses that will be recoverable under our reinsurance programs 
we base our estimate of funds recoverable upon our expectation of ultimate losses and the portion of those losses that we estimate to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms of our reinsurance agreements 
our assessment of the collectability of the recorded amounts receivable from reinsurers considers the payment history of the reinsurer  publicly available financial and rating agency data  our interpretation of the underlying contracts and policies  and responses by reinsurers 
appropriate reserves are established for any balances we believe may not be collected 
given the uncertainty of the ultimate amounts of our losses  our estimates of losses and related amounts recoverable may vary significantly from the eventual outcome 
also  we estimate premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements wherein the premium due to the reinsurer  subject to certain maximums and minimums  is based in part on losses reimbursed or to be reimbursed under the agreement 
any adjustments are reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our reinsurance balances  an adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 
investment valuations we have engaged an independent pricing service to provide us with the fair value for approximately of our investments  principally equity securities and fixed income securities 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the pricing service has a larger and more experienced staff than ours  has access to large quantities of data that would be difficult and expensive for us to acquire  and many years of valuation experience 
we determine fair value using an exchange traded price if one is available 
as of december  we valued approximately of our investments at fair value using an exchange traded price 
there is little judgment involved when fair value is determined using an exchange traded price 
in accordance with gaap  for disclosure purposes we classify securities valued using an exchange traded price as level securities 

table of contents approximately of our investments  principally our fixed income securities  are valued at fair value using available market information 
excluding government bonds  most fixed income securities do not trade daily and thus exchange traded prices are generally not available for these securities 
however  market information  such as last reported trade  non binding broker quotes  bids  benchmark yield curves  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  offers  and recent data regarding assumed prepayment speeds  cash flow and loan performance data often referred to as observable inputs  is available for most of our fixed income securities 
the pricing service provides us a price that has been determined using pricing models when multiple observable inputs are available but an exchange traded price is not 
pricing models vary by asset class and utilize the available market data for securities considered comparable to establish a price for our security 
the pricing service discloses the inputs used for each asset class that it prices and states that all market inputs used are scrutinized for consistency with other relevant market information before being included in the valuation computation 
determining fair values using these pricing models requires the use of judgment to identify appropriate comparable securities and to choose valuation methodology that is appropriate for the asset class and available data 
in accordance with gaap  for disclosure purposes we classify securities valued using multiple market observable inputs as level securities 
the pricing service provides a single price per instrument quoted 
we review the pricing for reasonableness each quarter by comparing market yields generated by the supplied price versus market yields observed in the market place 
if a supplied price is deemed unreasonable  we will discuss the provided valuation with the pricing service and would make adjustments if deemed necessary 
to date  we have not adjusted any prices supplied by the pricing service 
the pricing service provides a fair value only when an exchange traded price is available or when suitable multiple market observable inputs for a security can be identified 
we hold certain non public investments which are not valued by the pricing service and certain other securities which are valued by the pricing service in some periods  but not others  depending upon the level of recent market activity for the securities or comparable securities 
if the pricing service does not provide a price  management estimates fair value using either a single non binding broker quote or pricing models that utilize market based assumptions which have limited observable inputs 
the process involves significant judgment in selecting the appropriate data and modeling techniques to use in the valuation process 
we fair value of our investments in this manner 
in accordance with gaap  for disclosure purposes we classify securities that are valued using limited observable inputs as level securities 
we also hold interests in private investment funds non public investment partnerships and limited liability companies which are accounted for under the cost method and some of which are accounted for under the equity method  depending on our presumed degree of influence over the operating and financial policies of the fund 
we value our interests in the entities accounted for under the equity method based on quarterly net asset values provided to us by fund managers 
interests accounted for using the equity method total million at december  interests accounted for using the cost method total million at december  investment impairments we evaluate all our investments on at least a quarterly basis for declines in fair value that represent other than temporary impairments otti 
in all instances we consider an impairment to be an other than temporary impairment if we intend to sell the security or if we believe we will be required to sell the security before we fully recover the amortized cost basis of the security 
otherwise  we consider various factors in our evaluation  depending upon the type of security  as discussed below 

table of contents for equity securities  we consider the following the length of time for which the fair value of the investment has been less than its recorded basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer underlying the investment  taking into consideration the economic prospects of the issuer s industry and geographical region  to the extent that information is publicly available  the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
for debt securities  we consider the following whether or not we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis of the security  based upon consideration of some or all of the following third party research and credit rating reports  the current credit standing of the issuer  including credit rating downgrades extent to which the decline in fair value is attributable to credit risk specifically associated with an investment or its issuer  our internal assessments and those of our external portfolio managers regarding specific circumstances surrounding an investment  which can cause us to believe the investment is more or less likely to recover its value than other investments with a similar structure  for asset backed securities  the origination date of the underlying loans  the remaining average life  the probability that credit performance of the underlying loans will deteriorate in the future  and our assessment of the quality of the collateral underlying the loan  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments  any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency  recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
in assessing whether we expect to recover the cost basis of debt securities  particularly asset backed securities  we must make a number of assumptions regarding matters that will affect the cash flows that we expect to receive from the security in future periods 
these judgments are subjective in nature and may subsequently be proved to be inaccurate 
we evaluate our investments in private investment funds for otti by considering whether there has been a decline in fair value below the recorded value 
we receive reports from the funds at least quarterly which provide us a net asset value nav for our interest in the fund 
the nav is based on the fair values of securities held by the fund as determined by the fund manager 
determining whether there has been a decline in fair value involves assumptions and estimates 
we consider the most recent nav provided  the performance of the fund relative to the market  the stated objectives of the fund  and cash flows expected from the fund and audit results in considering whether an otti exists 
we also evaluate our holdings of federal home loan bank fhlb securities for impairment 
we consider the current capital status of the fhlb  whether the fhlb is in compliance with regulatory minimum capital requirements  and the reported operating results of the current period 

table of contents deferred policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs primarily commissions  premium taxes and underwriting salaries which are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal premiums  are capitalized as deferred policy acquisition costs and charged to expense as the related premium revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred policy acquisition costs each reporting period  and any amounts estimated to be unrecoverable are charged to expense in the current period 
deferred taxes deferred federal income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities determined for financial reporting purposes and the basis determined for income tax purposes 
our temporary differences principally relate to loss reserves  unearned premiums  deferred policy acquisition costs  unrealized investment gains losses and investment impairments 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such benefits are realized 
we review our deferred tax assets quarterly for impairment 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  management is required to make certain judgments and assumptions about our future operations based on historical experience and information as of the measurement period regarding reversal of existing temporary differences  carryback capacity  future taxable income including its capital and operating characteristics and tax planning strategies 
goodwill we make at least an annual assessment as to whether the value of our goodwill asset is impaired 
management evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter and before the annual evaluation if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below the carrying value 
we operate in a single operating segment 
our segment components are economically similar  and we consider proassurance to be one reporting unit for the purposes of evaluating goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit on the evaluation date based on proassurance s market capitalization and an expected premium that would be paid to acquire control of the company a control premium 
we then perform a sensitivity analysis using a range of historical stock prices and control premiums 
we concluded in   and that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and no adjustment to impair goodwill was necessary 
proassurance overview we are an insurance holding company and our operating results are primarily derived from the operations of our insurance subsidiaries  which principally write medical and other professional liability insurance 
corporate strategy our mission is to be the preferred source of professional liability protection by providing unparalleled claims defense  highly responsive customer service and innovative risk management while maintaining our commitment to long term financial strength 
according to am best s analysis of data  we are the largest publicly traded medical professional liability specialist insurance writer in the nation 
we believe our customer focus combined with our financial strength  strong reputation and proven ability to manage claims  will enable us  over the long term  to profitably expand our operations 
we have successfully acquired and integrated companies and books of business in the past and believe our financial size and strength make us an attractive acquirer 
we emphasize disciplined underwriting and do not manage our business to achieve a certain level of premium growth or market share 
in addition to 
table of contents prudent risk selection and pricing  we seek to control our underwriting results through effective claims management  and have fostered a strong culture of defending claims that we believe have no merit 
we manage claims by tailoring claims handling to the legal climate of each state  which we believe differentiates us from other national writers 
through our market based underwriting and claims office structure  we are able to gain a strong understanding of local market conditions and efficiently adapt our underwriting and claims strategies to regional conditions 
our market based focus allows us to maintain active relationships with our customers and be more responsive to their needs 
we understand the importance of the professional identity and reputation of our insureds 
an important part of our strategy is to emphasize the needs of our insureds throughout our operations 
we attempt to further our understanding of those needs through the use of advisory boards and operational committees that ensure we understand the challenges facing our insureds and ways we may best assist them 
we also believe that it is important to employ medical and legal professionals throughout our organization  especially on our senior management team 
we emphasize our pledge that each insured professional will be treated fairly in all of our conduct with them and that all of our business actions will be informed by the core values that guide our organization integrity  respect  doctor involvement  collaboration  communication and enthusiasm 
we believe our strategy allows us to compete on a basis other than price alone 
we also believe that our local market knowledge allows us to monitor and understand changes in the liability climate and thus develop better business strategies in a timely manner 
we have sustained our financial stability during difficult market conditions through responsible pricing and loss reserving practices and through conservative investment practices 
we are committed to maintaining prudent operating and financial leverage and conservatively investing our assets 
we recognize the importance that our customers and producers place on the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries and we manage our business to protect our financial security 
we measure performance in a number of ways  but particularly focus on our combined ratio and investment returns  both of which directly affect our return on equity roe 
we target a long term average roe of to 
we believe that a focus on rate adequacy  selective underwriting and effective claims management is required if we are to achieve our roe targets 
we closely monitor premium revenues  losses and loss adjustment costs  and acquisition  underwriting and insurance expenses 
our overall investment strategy is to focus on maximizing current income from our investment portfolio while maintaining safety  liquidity  duration and portfolio diversification 
we engage in activities that generate other income  however  such activities  principally fee and agency services  do not constitute a significant use of our resources or a significant source of revenues or profits 
growth opportunities and outlook we expect our long term growth to come through controlled expansion of our existing operations 
we also look to expand through the acquisition of other specialty insurance companies or books of business  however  such expansion is often opportunistic and cannot be predicted 
we continue to review our distribution channels and will make adjustments as market opportunities change 
we continue to face price based competition in virtually all of our markets 
some competitors offer coverage at rates we believe do not allow for an acceptable return for the risk being accepted 
one competitive trend emerging with greater frequency is hospitals purchasing physician practices 
in response to this trend  we have recently introduced a new product designed to provide greater risk sharing options to hospitals and large physician groups 
another continuing competitive trend is physicians and hospitals seeking to lower their costs through the use of alternative risk transfer approaches such as self insurance and risk sharing pools 
these alternatives become less attractive as prices soften in the traditional insurance markets 
our focus on basic fundamentals is providing opportunities in a variety of markets 
in  we strengthened our agency distribution system and improved work flows related to 
table of contents new business submissions 
these process improvements allowed us to review additional risks  increasing our overall new business writings despite continued price and coverage competition 
as a result of our branding campaign  treated fairly  and improvements in loss cost trends that have allowed us to reduce rates in certain markets  we were able to grow our organic physician count in which partially offset the effects of lower rates 
we believe our emphasis on fair treatment of our insureds and other important stakeholders enhanced our market position and differentiation 
we will continue to use treated fairly in all of our activities  and we believe that as we reach more customers with this message we will continue to improve retention and add new insureds  both of which will help offset the effects of lower rates 
our integration of our three acquisitions in provides opportunity for continued market leadership in the podiatry line and expands the markets for allied health and legal professional liability 
the entities now provide for licensure and opportunistic expansion within all states 
with each of the acquired entities we began to cross sell and identify new opportunities for all proassurance entities 
we continue to see new opportunities from each of the acquisitions and believe each will provide organic growth through expansion in their existing markets and relationships

fair value liabilities in august  the fasb revised gaap guidance regarding the valuation of liabilities at fair value  the guidance is effective for the first reporting period that begins after issuance of the guidance 
the updated guidance clarifies that when a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available  fair value should be determined using quoted prices for identical or similar liabilities traded as assets or using another valuation technique described in existing gaap guidance for determining fair values 
such techniques include present value techniques  and techniques based on the amount that a reporting entity would pay on the measurement date to transfer or enter into an identical liability 
we

fasb accounting standards codification effective for interim and annual periods ending after september   the fasb published the fasb accounting standards codification the codification as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental gaap 
the codification is not intended to change current gaap  but rather to provide all the authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place 
upon the effective date  all pre existing accounting standard documents were superseded and accounting literature not included in the codification became non authoritative 
we adopted use of the codification as of the quarter ended september   adoption had no effect on our results of operations or financial position 
subsequent events effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after june   the fasb revised gaap guidance to more clearly set forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management should evaluate events or transactions for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which events or transactions after the balance sheet date should be recognized and the disclosures that should be made regarding such events 
we adopted the revised guidance as of the quarter ended june   adoption had no effect on our results of operations or financial position 
fair value effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after june   the fasb revised gaap guidance regarding the valuation of assets or liabilities when the volume and level of market transactions for those assets or liabilities has significantly decreased 
the revised guidance clarifies factors to be considered in determining whether there has been a significant decrease in market activity for an asset in relation to normal activity and provides additional guidance on when the use of multiple or different valuation techniques may be warranted and considerations for determining the weight that should be applied to the various techniques 
the revisions also establish a requirement that conclusions about whether transactions are orderly be based on the weight of the evidence and require entities to disclose any changes to valuation techniques and related inputs that result from a conclusion that markets are not orderly and the effect of the change  if practicable 
the revised guidance also expanded disclosure requirements regarding the fair value of financial instruments 
we adopted the revised guidance as of the quarter ended june   adoption had no significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
investments disclosure requirements  other than temporary impairments effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after june   the fasb revised gaap to require expanded disclosures related to investments in debt and equity securities 
guidance regarding other than temporary impairments was also revised 
previous investment guidance required that an impairment of a debt security be considered as other than temporary unless management could assert both the intent and the ability to hold the impaired security until recovery of value 
the revised impairment guidance specifies that an impairment be considered as other than temporary unless an entity can assert that it has no intent to sell the security and that it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its anticipated amortized cost basis 
the new guidance also establishes the concept of credit loss 
credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from a debt security and the amortized cost basis of the security 
the new guidance states that in instances in which a determination is made that a credit loss exists but the entity does not intend to sell the debt security and it is not more likely than not that the 
table of contents entity will be required to sell the debt security before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis an impairment is to be separated into a the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss and b the amount of total impairment related to all other factors 
the credit loss component of the impairment is to be recognized in income of the current period 
the non credit component is to be recognized as a part of other comprehensive income 
transition provisions require a cumulative effect adjustment to reclassify the noncredit component of a previously recognized other than temporary impairment from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income if an entity does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
we adopted the revised guidance as of the beginning of the quarter ended june  as of april   our debt securities included non credit impairment losses previously recognized in earnings of approximately million 
in accordance with the transition provisions of the revised guidance  we reclassified these non credit losses  net of tax  from retained earnings to accumulated comprehensive income as of april  a million increase to retained earnings  a million decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income 
convertible debentures effective january   the fasb revised gaap guidance regarding the accounting for convertible debentures 
the revised guidance requires issuers to account for convertible debt securities that allow for either mandatory or optional cash settlement including partial cash settlement by separating the liability and equity components in a manner that reflects the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance and requires recognition of additional non cash interest expense in subsequent periods based on the nonconvertible rate 
additionally  when such debt instruments are repaid or converted  any consideration transferred at settlement is to be allocated between the extinguishment of the liability component and the reacquisition of the equity component 
the revised guidance is applicable to the convertible debentures which we converted in july we adopted the revised guidance as of its effective date january   adoption had no effect on operating results because no convertible debt has been outstanding during the cumulative effect of adoption  which would be an increase to additional paid in capital of  and an offsetting decrease to retained earnings of the same amount  has not been recorded because the effect is immaterial and would not change total stockholders equity 
non controlling interests in subsidiaries effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december   the fasb revised gaap guidance to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
we adopted the revised guidance as of its effective date  january  adoption did not have an effect on our results of operations or financial position 
business combinations effective prospectively for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   the fasb revised gaap guidance related to business combinations 
the revised guidance retains the previous requirement that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations but provides new and additional guidance including defining the acquirer in a transaction  the valuation of assets and liabilities when noncontrolling interests exist  the treatment of contingent consideration  the treatment of costs incurred to effect the acquisition  the treatment of reorganization costs  and the valuation of assets and liabilities when the purchase price is below the net fair value of assets acquired

trading security cash flows effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the fasb revised gaap regarding cash flows from purchases  sales and maturities of trading securities 
under the new guidance  such cash flows are classified based on the nature and purpose for which the securities were acquired 
under prior guidance  cash flows from purchases  sales and maturities of trading securities were classified as operating cash flows 
proassurance adopted this guidance as of january  accordingly  proassurance s statement of cash flows reflects trading security cash flows during based on the prior guidance  whereas cash flows during and are based on the revised guidance 
accounting changes not yet adopted fair value measurements effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  or december   as specified  the fasb revised gaap guidance related to fair value measurement to require additional disclosures and to clarify certain existing disclosure requirements

liquidity and capital resources and financial condition overview proassurance corporation is a holding company and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
because it has no other business operations  dividends from its operating subsidiaries represent a significant source of funds for its obligations  including debt service 
our insurance subsidiaries  in aggregate  are permitted to pay dividends of approximately million during without prior approval 
however  the payment of any dividend requires prior notice to the insurance regulator in the state of domicile and the regulator may prevent the dividend if  in its judgment  payment of the dividend would have an adverse effect on the surplus of the insurance subsidiary 
at december  we held cash and investments of approximately million outside of our insurance subsidiaries that are available for use without regulatory approval 
acquisitions in the first quarter of we acquired of the outstanding shares of mid continent and georgia lawyers as a means of expanding our professional liability business 
these acquisitions were not material to proassurance individually or in the aggregate 
on april  we acquired podiatry insurance company of america and subsidiaries pica through a cash sponsored demutualization as a means of expanding our professional liability insurance operations 
pica provides professional liability insurance primarily to podiatric physicians  chiropractors and other healthcare providers throughout the united states 
we purchased all of pica s outstanding stock created in the demutualization for million in cash  of which million was a surplus contribution to be used to provide renewal premium credits to eligible policyholders over a three year period beginning in see note to the consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding the pica transaction  including a summarized listing of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
cash flows the principal components of our operating cash flows are the excess of net investment income and premiums collected over net losses paid and operating costs  including income taxes 
timing delays exist between the collection of premiums and the payment of losses associated with the premiums 
premiums are generally collected within the twelve month period after the policy is written while our claim payments are generally paid over a more extended period of time 
likewise  timing delays exist between the payment of claims and the collection of any associated reinsurance recoveries 

table of contents our operating activities provided positive cash flows of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating cash flows for and compare as follows in millions cash flow increase decrease cash provided by operating activities year ended december  increase decrease in operating cash flows during  exclusive of pica lower premium receipts lower investment receipts increase in net premium payments to reinsurers decrease in losses paid decrease in reinsurance recoveries commutation receipts no comparable receipts during increase in federal income tax payments payment of chw judgment other amounts not individually significant  net pica operating cash flows cash provided by operating activities year ended december  premiums written increased in  but approximately million of the increase relates to two year policies for which the second term amount is not due to be received until the timing of our loss payments varies from period to period because the process for resolving claims is complex and occurs at an uneven pace depending upon the circumstances of the individual claim 
the timing of reinsurance recoveries varies from period to period and can depend upon the nature of the reinsurance treaty  the nature of the underlying claim and the timing and amount of underlying losses 
the increase in tax payments reflects timing differences 
our estimated tax payments for the fourth quarter period are paid in the next fiscal year 
fourth quarter taxable income was significantly more in than in  which resulted in a related tax payment in first quarter that was higher than the payment made in first quarter of in we paid a judgment in favor of columbia hospital for women medical center  inc chw entered against our subsidiary  proassurance national capital insurance company pra national  prior to our acquisition of pra national

we manage our investments to ensure that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations  taking into consideration the timing of cash flows from our investments  including interest payments  dividends and principal payments  as well as the expected cash flows to be generated by our operations 
we anticipate that between million and million of our investments will mature or be paid down each quarter of the next year and become available  if needed  to meet our cash flow requirements 
the primary outflow of cash at our insurance subsidiaries is related to net paid losses and operating costs  including income taxes 
the payment of individual claims cannot be predicted with certainty  therefore  we rely upon the history of paid claims in estimating the timing of future claims payments 
to the extent that we have an unanticipated shortfall in cash we may either liquidate securities or borrow funds under previously established borrowing arrangements 
however  given the relatively short duration of our investments  we do not foresee any such shortfall 
we held cash and short term securities of million at december  as compared to million at december  we utilized million in the pica acquisition in april we also moved funds to longer term investments during as credit markets stabilized 
our investment portfolio continues to be composed of high quality fixed income securities with approximately of our fixed maturities being either united states government agency or investment grade securities as determined by national rating agencies 
the weighted average effective duration of our fixed maturity securities at december  is years  the weighted average effective duration of our fixed maturity securities combined with our short term securities is years 
the securities acquired in the pica transaction were  on average  longer in duration than the securities we already owned  which caused a small increase in the overall weighted average effective duration 
at december  we held asset backed securities with a fair value of million recorded cost basis of million 
during  we recognized million of losses on asset backed securities primarily relating to mortgage backed securities impacted by the deterioration of the housing market 
in performing our otti assessment of mortgage backed securities  management projects expected cash flows  making assumptions regarding expected default rates and the value of collateral available to recover losses 
if estimated cash flows project a loss  an otti is realized for the difference between the book value and present value of the anticipated cash flows in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in some cases  the impairment loss is greater than the projected loss because market values are depressed as a result of market uncertainty and an aversion to risk by market participants 
if we continue to hold these securities  and our estimates of projected loss prove over time to be accurate  the economic loss that we ultimately realize will be less than the impairment loss that has been recorded 
conversely  because our judgments about future default rates  the timing of expected cash flows and the estimated value of collateral may not prove over time to be accurate  we may experience losses on asset backed securities that we are not currently projecting 
we hold five positions in financial institution fixed maturity securities for which the position held has a fair value that exceeds million 
the aggregate fair value of these five positions totals million million recorded cost basis  of which million is fdic backed 
at december  we held fixed maturity securities with pretax net unrealized gains of approximately million as compared to pretax net unrealized losses of million as of december  
table of contents the improvement is primarily due to a reduction in credit spreads  particularly with respect to state and municipal securities and corporate bonds  offset somewhat by the impact of slightly higher market interest rates 
the fixed maturity securities acquired in the pica transaction were valued at their fair value on the date of acquisition  april  see notes and and overall have appreciated in value because of lower market interest rates at december  losses the following table  known as the analysis of reserve development  presents information over the preceding ten years regarding the payment of our losses as well as changes to the development of our estimates of losses during that time period 
years prior to relate only to the reserves of proassurance s predecessor  medical assurance 
in years and thereafter the table reflects the reserves of proassurance  formed in in order to merge medical assurance and professionals group 
pra national reserves are included only in the year and thereafter 
pra wisconsin reserves are included only in the year and thereafter 
pica and georgia lawyers reserves are included only in the year the table includes losses on both a direct and an assumed basis and is net of reinsurance recoverables 
the gross liability for losses before reinsurance  as shown on the balance sheet  and the reconciliation of that gross liability to amounts net of reinsurance are reflected below the table 
we do not discount our reserve for losses to present value 
information presented in the table is cumulative and  accordingly  each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior years 
the table presents the development of our balance sheet reserve for losses  it does not present accident year or policy year development data 
conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table 
the following may be helpful in understanding the analysis of reserve development the line entitled reserve for losses  undiscounted and net of reinsurance recoverables reflects our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense  less the receivables from reinsurers  each as reported in our consolidated financial statements at the end of each year the balance sheet reserves 
the section entitled cumulative net paid  as of reflects the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of each succeeding year with respect to the previously recorded balance sheet reserves 
the section entitled re estimated net liability as of reflects the re estimated amount of the liability previously recorded as balance sheet reserves that includes the cumulative amounts paid and an estimate of additional liability based upon claims experience as of the end of each succeeding year the net re estimated liability 
the line entitled net cumulative redundancy deficiency reflects the difference between the previously recorded balance sheet reserve for each applicable year and the net re estimated liability relating thereto as of the end of the most recent fiscal year

table of contents in each year reflected in the table  we have estimated our reserve for losses utilizing the management and actuarial processes discussed in critical accounting estimates 
factors that have contributed to the variation in loss development are primarily related to the extended period of time required to resolve professional liability claims and include the following prior to the mid to late s our business was largely based in alabama 
when we began to expand geographically  we utilized industry based data as well as our own data to support our actuarial projection process 
our own claims experience proved to be better than the projected experience  but this was not known for some time after the reserves were established 
ultimately  as actual results proved better than that suggested by historical trends and industry claims data  redundancies developed and were recognized 
the medical professional liability legal environment deteriorated in the late s 
beginning in  we recognized adverse trends in claim severity causing increased estimates of certain loss liabilities 
as a result  favorable development of prior year reserves slowed in and reversed in and we addressed these trends through increased rates  stricter underwriting and modifications to claims handling procedures 
during  and we have recognized favorable development related to our previously established reserves primarily for accident years through because we have reduced our estimates of claims severity related to those years 
based on recent internal and industry claims data  we believe claims severity ie  the average size of a claim is increasing at a rate slower than we estimated when our reserves for those years were established 
activity in our net reserve for losses during  and is summarized below in thousands year ended december balance  beginning of year less receivable from reinsurers net balance  beginning of year reserves acquired from acquisitions incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid net balance  end of year plus receivable from reinsurers balance  end of year at december  our gross reserve for losses included case reserves of approximately billion and ibnr reserves of approximately billion 
our consolidated reserve for losses on a gaap basis exceeds the combined reserves of our insurance subsidiaries on a statutory basis by approximately million  which is principally due to the portion of the gaap reserve for losses that is reflected for statutory accounting purposes as unearned premiums 
these unearned premiums are applicable to extended reporting endorsements tail coverage issued without a premium charge upon death  disability  or retirement of an insured 

table of contents reinsurance we use reinsurance to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability  to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits  and to stabilize underwriting results in years in which higher losses occur 
the purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies  but it does provide reimbursement from the reinsurer for certain losses paid by us 
we generally reinsure professional liability risks under annual treaties pursuant to which the reinsurer agrees to assume all or a portion of all risks that we insure above our individual risk retention of million per claim  up to the maximum individual limit offered currently million 
historically  the professional liability per claim retention level has varied between and of the first million and between and of claims exceeding those levels depending on the coverage year and the state in which business was written 
we also insure some large professional liability risks that are above the limits of our basic reinsurance treaties 
these risks are reinsured on a facultative basis  whereby the reinsurer agrees to insure a particular risk up to a designated limit 
our primary reinsurance agreement is negotiated annually at october under our most recent agreement  effective october   we will not be reimbursed for allocated loss adjustment expenses 
as a result  the minimum and maximum premium due under the agreement have been lowered  which we believe will compensate for the decrease in recoveries under the treaty 
therefore  we do not expect these changes to result in a significant overall change in the cost of reinsurance 
our risk retention level is dependent upon numerous factors including our risk tolerance and the capital we have to support it  the price and availability of reinsurance  volume of business  level of experience with a particular set of claims and our analysis of the potential underwriting results within each state 
we purchase reinsurance from a number of companies to mitigate concentrations of credit risk 
we utilize a reinsurance broker to assist us in the analysis of the credit quality of our reinsurers 
we base our reinsurance buying decisions on an evaluation of the then current financial strength  rating and stability of prospective reinsurers 
however  the financial strength of our reinsurers  and their corresponding ability to pay us  may change in the future due to forces or events we cannot control or anticipate 
we have not experienced significant collection difficulties due to the financial condition of any reinsurer  however  periodically  reinsurers may dispute our claim for reimbursement from them 
we have established appropriate reserves for any balances that we believe may not be ultimately collected 
should future events lead us to believe that any reinsurer will not meet its obligations to us  adjustments to the amounts recoverable would be reflected in the results of current operations 
such an adjustment has the potential to be significant to the results of operations in the period in which it is recorded  however  we would not expect such an adjustment to have a material effect on our capital position or our liquidity

treasury stock we repurchased approximately million common shares  having a total cost of million  during the year ended december  we reissued  treasury shares as a part of the consideration for acquisitions during the first quarter of our board of directors authorized million in april  an additional million in august  and an additional million in september for the repurchase of common shares or the retirement of outstanding debt 
approximately million of the amounts authorized by the board remains available for use at december  litigation we are involved in various legal actions arising primarily from claims against us related to insurance policies and claims handling  including  but not limited to  claims asserted by our policyholders 
legal actions are generally divided into two categories those dealing with claims and claim related activities which we consider in our evaluation of our reserve for losses  and those falling outside of these areas which we evaluate and account for as a part of our other liabilities 
in accordance with gaap for insurance entities  claim related actions are considered as a part of our loss reserving process 
we evaluate the likely outcomes from these actions giving consideration to the facts and laws applicable to each case  appellate issues  coverage issues  potential recoveries from our insurance and reinsurance programs  and settlement discussions as well as our historical claims resolution practices 
this data is then given consideration in the overall evaluation of our reserve for losses 
there are risks  as outlined in our risk factors in part  that any of these actions could cost us more than our estimates 
in particular  we or our insureds may receive adverse verdicts  post trial motions may be denied  in whole or in part  any appeals that may be undertaken may be unsuccessful  we may be unsuccessful in our legal efforts to limit the scope of coverage available to insureds  and we may become a party to bad faith litigation over the resolution of a claim 
to the extent that the cost of resolving these actions exceeds our estimates  the legal actions could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which any such action is resolved 
for non claim related actions  we evaluate each case separately and establish what we believe is an appropriate reserve based on gaap guidance related to contingent liabilities

table of contents pra exclusive of pica changes in our premium volume are driven by three primary factors our retention of existing business  the amount of new business we are able to generate including business that comes to pra as a result of acquisitions  and the premium charged for business that is renewed  which is affected both by rates charged and by the amount and type of coverage an insured chooses to purchase 
the professional liability market continues to remain competitive with some competitors choosing to compete primarily on price 
physician premiums continue to be our primary revenue source and comprise and of our gross premiums written in and  respectively 
our physician retention rate is and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
retention rates are affected by a number of factors 
insureds may terminate coverage because they are leaving the practice of medicine through death  disability or retirement 
also  based on our underwriting evaluation  we may choose not to renew an insured 
we may lose business to competitors or to self insurance mechanisms often when physicians join hospital based practice groups due to pricing or other issues 
new business increased during we wrote approximately million of new physician business during the year that was not attributable to acquisitions  as compared to million in in the third and fourth quarters of  we began renewing physician policies for a two year term in a selected jurisdiction 
written premium for the entire two year policy term is recorded in the period the policy is renewed  while earned premium is recorded on a pro rata basis over the two year policy term 
the gross written premiums attributable to two year policies for is million as compared to million written in also  in  in order to more evenly distribute renewals throughout the year  we offered early renewal to a number of insureds who would otherwise have had a first quarter renewal date 
as a result of the shift in renewal dates  there will be approximately million less in business eligible to be renewed 
as favorable loss trends have emerged we have lowered our rates where indicated 
for our physician business  our charged rates on renewals decreased on average  as compared to an average decrease of for our charged rates include the effects of filed rates  surcharges and discounts 
despite competitive pressures  we remain committed to a rate structure that will allow us to fulfill our obligations to our insureds  while generating competitive returns for our stockholders 
our non physician healthcare providers are primarily dentists and allied health professionals 
the increase in this business is primarily attributable to business contributed by mid continent 
non physician other premiums are primarily legal professional liability premiums  but also includes other types of general liability premiums 
the acquisitions of georgia lawyers and mid continent contributed additional non physician premiums of approximately million in we separately report tail premiums because we offer extended reporting endorsement or tail policies to insureds that are discontinuing their claims made coverage with us  but we do not market such coverages separately 
the amount of tail premium written and earned can vary widely from period to period 
pica gross premiums written contributed by pica consist primarily of coverages provided to podiatrists  who are categorized as physician premiums in the above table  and coverages provided to chiropractors  who are categorized as non physician health care providers in the above table 
our retention rate for the core pica business is approximately 

table of contents premiums earned in thousands year ended december change premiums earned pra all other pica acquisition   nm because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period  fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written 
generally  our policies carry a term of one year  but as discussed above  beginning in late we began to renew some policies with a two year term 
tail premiums are earned in the period written because the policies insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods and are not cancellable 
pra exclusive of pica exclusive of the effect of tail premiums and acquisitions  the decline in premiums earned for the year ended december  as compared to reflects declines in gross premiums written during and pica pica subsidiaries contributed earned premiums of approximately million during  approximately million of which relates to premiums written prior to the date of acquisition and thus never reported in our written premiums 
at december  approximately million of premium written prior to the acquisition is yet to be earned and will be added to our earned premium on a pro rata basis  principally during the first quarter of premiums ceded in thousands year ended december change premiums ceded pra all other pica acquisition   nm points reinsurance expense ratio pra all other pica acquisition nm consolidated calculated as premiums ceded as a percentage of premiums earned premiums ceded represent the portion of earned premiums that we pay our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses 
the premium that we cede to our reinsurers is determined  in part  by the loss experience subject to minimums and maximums of the business ceded to them 
it takes a number of years before all losses are known  and in the intervening period  premiums due to the reinsurers are estimated 

table of contents pra exclusive of pica premiums ceded in both and include amounts related to changes to our estimates of reinsurance premiums incurred for prior accident years  as follows 
in thousands premiums ceded reinsurance expense ratio year ended december year ended december premiums ceded  before estimate changes estimate changes  prior accident years premiums ceded the increase in our reinsurance expense ratio for is due to an increase in premiums ceded  along with a decrease in premiums earned  which reflects shifts in the mix of our premiums 
the increase in premiums ceded is principally related to legal professional liability premiums  which are generally more heavily reinsured than our physician premiums 
the decline in premiums earned is principally attributable to physician policies with lower coverage limits for which we retain all of the risk of loss  consequently  there is no corresponding decrease to premiums ceded 
the amount of reinsurance premiums incurred for prior accident years is largely determined based on the losses expected to be recovered  subject to certain minimums and maximums specific to the reinsurance agreement being adjusted 
in both and  we reduced our estimates of prior accident year gross losses within our reinsured layers of coverage  as well as the related reinsurance recoveries and premiums ceded 
however  the reductions were more pronounced in pica the pica subsidiaries cede only a small portion of the risk on the policies they issue 
accordingly  the reinsurance expense ratio for these entities is minimal

the increase in income in reflects higher average invested balances  the benefit of which was offset almost entirely by lower yields 
the increase in average invested balances is principally attributable to the pica acquisition

losses and loss adjustment expenses the determination of calendar year losses involves the actuarial evaluation of incurred losses for the current accident year and the actuarial re evaluation of incurred losses for prior accident years  including an evaluation of the reserve amounts required for losses in excess of policy limits 
accident year refers to the accounting period in which the insured event becomes a liability of the insurer 
for occurrence policies the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place  for claims made policies  which represent the majority of the company s business  the insured event generally becomes a liability when the event is first reported to the insurer 
we believe that measuring losses on an accident year basis is the most indicative measure of the underlying profitability of the premiums earned in that period since it associates policy premiums earned with the estimate of the losses incurred related to those policy premiums 
all losses associated with the subsidiaries we acquired from pica are considered current accident year losses because the insured event became a proassurance liability in the following table summarizes calendar year net losses and net loss ratios for the years ended december  and  respectively  by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years 
in millions net losses net loss ratios year ended december year ended december change change current accident year pra all other pica acquisition consolidated prior accident years pra all other pica acquisition consolidated calendar year pra all other pica acquisition consolidated net losses as specified divided by net premiums earned 
pra exclusive of pica the current accident year loss ratio increased points when compared to the prior year  approximately of this increase is attributable to an increase to our reserve for the death  disability and retirement ddr provision in our claims made polices 
after a number of coverage years  most of our insureds qualify for this extended coverage when the insured retires or should the insured die or become disabled during the policy term 
our strong retention rate has resulted in an increase in the number of insureds expected to become eligible to receive this extended coverage and we have recorded a corresponding increase to the related reserve 

table of contents during the years ended december  and  we recognized favorable loss development of million and million  on a net basis  related to reserves established in prior years 
the principal components of development are as follows in millions year ended december reserve development by accident year  favorable unfavorable accident years accident years accident years accident years prior to net favorable development recognized substantially all of the development recognized during and relates to medical professional liability claims made reserves 
the favorable development for medical professional claims made policies in both and is based upon observation of actual claims data which indicates that claims severity ie  the expected average cost of claims is trending below our initial expectations 
given both the long tailed nature of our business and the past volatility of final claim settlement values  we are generally cautious in giving credence to the trends that lead to the recognition of favorable net loss development 
as we conclude that sufficient credible data with respect to these trends exists we take appropriate actions 
in the case of the claims severity trends  we believe it is appropriate to recognize the impact of these trends in our actuarial evaluation of prior period loss estimates while also remaining attentive to the past volatility of claims severity 
in establishing the rates for our insurance products we consider loss and loss trends over a multi year period 
to the extent that we experience improvements in claims frequency and claims severity these improvements are considered in our rate making process and reflected in our established rates 
we have reflected decreased estimates of severity in our rate making process as well as in our loss estimates for several years 
assumptions used in establishing our reserve are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in the current operations 
due to the size of our reserve  even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made 
pica the current accident year loss ratio was adversely affected by an increase to reserves for the ddr provision associated with pica claims made policies and by unfavorable development of losses associated with certain other liability coverages 
when the effect of these two items is excluded pica net loss ratio is approximately 
in  we plan to discontinue offering the other liability coverage that generated the unfavorable development

pica transaction expenses of  were paid by proassurance during insurance related expenses exclusive of pica expenses during reflect a number of cost variations  but changed little on a net basis 
expenses for commissions  brokerage fees  and underwriting and sales salaries and benefits were higher in  both because we earned more non physician premiums which carry higher expenses than physician premiums and because more of our physician premium was generated by external commissioned agents 
also  guaranty fund recoupments are lower in than in partially offsetting these higher costs is a million reduction in share based compensation costs  due to a different type of award made in costs were also reduced in by a million benefit related to final settlement of the chw judgment actual costs incurred were less than amounts previously estimated 
other expense information non insurance related expenses 
we operate several insurance agencies and provide benefit management services on a limited basis through a separate pica subsidiary 
these activities generate commission and service fee revenues  which are reported as a part of other income 
the acquisition of mid continent and pica increased these expenses in we have excluded the direct expenses of these activities from our underwriting expense ratio computations because the activities are not associated with the generation of premiums revenues

insurance related expenses in the table above are reduced by net recoupments from guaranty fund assessments of approximately  and million during and  respectively 
underwriting expense ratio exclusive of pica the point increase in our underwriting expense ratio is primarily a result of a decline in net premiums earned in as compared to  while expenses remained relatively flat

the effect of tax exempt income on our effective tax rate is shown in the table below year ended december statutory rate tax exempt income other effective tax rate tax exempt income had a less significant effect on our effective tax rate primarily because taxable income increased at a greater rate than tax exempt income 
our taxable income reflected impairment losses of million  whereas taxable income reflected impairment losses of million

table of contents premiums in thousands year ended december change gross premiums written premiums earned premiums ceded net premiums earned gross premiums written gross premiums written declined during as compared to  reflecting the effects of lower premium rates and a very competitive insurance market 
the change in premiums is driven by three primary factors our ability and desire to retain expiring business  the change in premium rates we charge on the business we do renew  which can also be affected by the coverage an insured chooses to purchase  and the production of new business 
during our retention rate remained above which is consistent with prior years 
the professional liability market place remains extremely competitive and many of our competitors have been aggressive  particularly in pricing their products to retain their existing business as well as in seeking new business 
the decline in premiums during also reflects the fact that overall  we are charging our insureds less given the favorable trends that have been emerging in losses 
during and we have recognized improving loss trends in our rate making analysis  and have lowered the rates we charge our insureds where indicated 
as policies take effect at these lower rates our premiums written have declined 
for our physician business  which is discussed in more detail below  our charged rates on renewed business reflect an average decrease of for charged rates include the effects of filed rates  surcharges and discounts 
finally  the acquisition of new business continues to be challenging 
despite competitive pressures  we remain committed to a rate structure that will allow us to fulfill our obligations to our insureds  while still generating fair returns for our stockholders 
physician premiums represent and of gross premiums written during and  respectively 
amounts written in have declined as compared to  as shown below 
in thousands year ended december change physician premiums exclusive of tail premiums as discussed below our overall retention rate is approximately for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the retention rate is driven by several factors 
our underwriting evaluation may cause us to non renew an insured 
an insured may leave the practice of medicine through death  disability or retirement and  finally  we may lose business due to pricing or other issues  to our competitors or to self insurance mechanisms 
premiums written for non physician coverages represent and of our total gross premiums written for years ended december  and  respectively 
in thousands year ended december change non physician premiums hospital and facility other non physician exclusive of tail premiums as discussed below 
table of contents hospital and facility coverages are the most significant component of non physician premiums and represent and of our total gross premiums written for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other non physician coverages consist primarily of professional liability coverages provided to lawyers and to other health care professionals such as dentists and allied health professionals 
we are seeing the same competitive pressures in these areas as we are seeing in our physician business 
we are required to offer extended reporting endorsement or tail policies to insureds that are discontinuing their claims made coverage with us  but we do not market such coverages separately 
the amount of tail premium written and earned can vary widely from period to period 
tail premiums totaled approximately million and million gross written premiums for both comparative periods for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million 
many of our competitors are offering prior acts coverage to induce insureds to change insurance carriers 
the availability of prior acts coverage negates the need for a non renewing insured to purchase a tail policy 
premiums earned in thousands year ended december change premiums earned because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period  fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written 
our policies generally carry a term of one year 
tail premiums are earned in the period written because the policies insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods and are not cancellable 
exclusive of the effect of tail premiums  the decline in premiums earned for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in reflects declines in gross premiums written during and also  premiums earned in include million that originated from unearned premiums acquired in the merger with pra wisconsin 
during the twelve months preceding december   our written premiums have declined as compared to written premiums for the twelve months preceding december  consequently  earned premiums are expected to continue to be lower than earned premiums 
premiums ceded in thousands year ended december change premiums ceded premiums ceded represent the portion of earned premiums that we pay our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses 
the premium that we cede to our reinsurers is determined  in part  by the loss experience subject to minimums and maximums of the business ceded to them 
it takes a number of years before all losses are known  and in the intervening period  premiums due to the reinsurers are estimated 
exclusive of amounts included in the following table  our reinsurance expense ratio premiums ceded as a percentage of premiums earned averages in both and

net investment income by investment category is as follows in thousands year ended december change fixed maturities equities short term investments other invested assets business owned life insurance investment expenses net investment income fixed maturities 
the increase in income from our investment in fixed maturities primarily reflects some improvement in yields  which are more pronounced on a tax equivalent basis because we shifted funds into state and municipal bonds as progressed 
although bond yields increased in  we did not increase our fixed maturity holdings significantly due to unstable market conditions 
average yields for our available for sale fixed maturity securities during and are as follows year ended december average income yield average tax equivalent income yield short term investments 
the decrease in earnings from short term investments reflects a decline in market interest rates an average of basis points in as compared to other invested assets 
the decline in income from other invested assets reflects a million reduction in distributions from our investment in a private fund accounted for on a cost basis  as a result of turmoil in the debt markets 
because we recognize income related to these funds as it is distributed to us  our income from these holdings can vary significantly from period to period

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that we are principally exposed to three types of market risk related to our investment operations 
these risks are interest rate risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
interest rate risk our fixed maturities portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  market values of fixed income portfolios fall and vice versa 
certain of the securities are held in an unrealized loss position  we do not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell any of the debt securities held in an unrealized loss position before its anticipated recovery 
the following table summarizes estimated changes in the fair value of our available for sale fixed maturity securities for specific hypothetical changes in interest rates by asset class for december  there are principally two factors that determine interest rates on a given security market interest rates and credit spreads 
as different asset classes can be affected in different ways by movements in those two factors  we have broken out our portfolio by asset class in the following table 
in millions  except duration december  interest rate shift in basis points current fixed maturities  available for sale us treasury and agency obligations duration state and municipal bonds duration corporate bonds duration asset backed securities duration fixed maturities  available for sale total duration december  fixed maturities  available for sale total duration computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of fixed income security assets  and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of the fair value of fixed rate instruments 
actual values may differ from those projections presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of individual securities  including non parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates and changing individual issuer credit spreads 
proassurance s cash and short term investment portfolio at december  is on a cost basis which approximates its fair value 
this portfolio lacks significant interest rate sensitivity due to its short duration 

table of contents credit risk we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
we control this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed income securities we purchase 
as of december   of our fixed maturity securities are rated investment grade as determined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros  such as moody s  standard poor s and fitch 
we believe that this concentration in investment grade securities reduces our exposure to credit risk on our fixed income investments to an acceptable level 
however  investment grade securities  in spite of their rating  can rapidly deteriorate and result in significant losses 
ratings published by the nrsros are one of the tools used to evaluate the credit worthiness of our securities 
the ratings reflect the subjective opinion of the rating agencies as to the credit worthiness of the securities  and therefore  we may be subject to additional credit exposure should the rating prove to be unreliable 
we hold billion of municipal bonds 
these bonds may have enhanced credit ratings as a result of guarantees by an insurer  but we require the bonds that we purchase to meet our credit criteria on a stand alone basis 
as of december   on a stand alone basis  our municipal bonds have a weighted average rating of aa 
equity price risk at december  the fair value of our investment in common stocks was million 
these securities are subject to equity price risk  which is defined as the potential for loss in fair value due to a decline in equity prices 
the weighted average beta of this group of securities is 
beta measures the price sensitivity of an equity security or group of equity securities to a change in the broader equity market  in this case the s p index 
if the value of the s p index increased by  the fair value of these securities would be expected to increase by to million 
conversely  a decrease in the s p index would imply a decrease of in the fair value of these securities to million 
the selected hypothetical changes of plus or minus do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios and are used for illustrative purposes only
