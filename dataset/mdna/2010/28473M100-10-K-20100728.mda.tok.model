the edms business segment consists primarily of the product lines and services whic h dci produced  including custom electronic assemblies  engineering services  customer liquid crystal displays and other interface technologies 
the proprietary business segment is made up of the former ntg and radix products and services and includes remote monitoring hardware and messaging services in addition to ultra rugged hand held computers  peripherals and maintenance contract revenues 
the extremetag and sensorcast technology and products that were acquired during the fiscal year were incorporated into the proprietary business segment 
the company s corporate level expenses and corporate management fee revenue are performed in a centralized environment and are not attributable to a particular business segment

the fair value of the  shares of common stock was  on june  the agreement also contained a provision for additional performance related consideration that is subject to certain conditions and is limited to approximately  shares of the comp any s common stock 
the company has determined that it is unlikely that any additional contingent consideration will be paid related to this acquisition 
the company completed its assessment based on the terms of the agreement and the company s expectations of the growth of the extremetag product line in relation to its total overall revenue growth over the period covered by the agreement 
on october   the company refinanced its operating line of credit and refinanced its long term financing secured by its operations and headquarters facility in olathe  kansas 
the new  line of credit provides the company with short term financing for working capital requirements  is secured by accounts receivable and inventory  and expires on october  the company s borrowing capacity under this line is calculated as a specified percentage of accounts receivable and inventory 
the line of credit accrues interest at a performance based rate that is based on the prime rate at april  plus minus and has an interest rate floor of 
the interest rate is actually determined by the company s debt to tangible net worth ratio and was on april  the loan agreement has various covenants  including a financial covenant pertaining to the maintenance of total tangible net worth

the company acquired approximately  in tangible assets  including accounts receivable  inventory and equipment as well as all of the intellectual property and intangible assets owned by sensorcast 
the purchase price of the acquisition was  shares of the company s common stock that are not freely transferable and  in cash 
the total cost of the acquisition including all assets acquired and liabilities assumed was approximately  results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods presented  certain statement of operations data in thousands of the company years ended april  april  sales cost of products sold gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss income interest expense other income  net net loss income before taxes income tax benefit expense net loss income net loss income per share basic net loss income per share diluted sales for the fiscal year ended april  were approximately  a decrease of  or  from  for fiscal sales for the edms segment were approximately  a decrease of  or  from  in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in sales to outside customers was a result of lower bookings during the preceding quarters of the prior fiscal year and the first half of fiscal due to lingering effects of the weakened economy  the resulting cautious order patterns from our long time customers and delays in bookings from new customers 
these events led to a sharp decrease in sales during the first half of fiscal which greatly contributed to the decrease in sales for the fiscal year 
the second half of fiscal showed an improved level of bookings and revenues as compared to the first half of fiscal and the comparable period of fiscal bookings increased   and revenues increased  from the comparable period in fiscal we continue to anticipate  as a result of the addition of several new customers  renewed orders from our existing customers  the transition of several projects from our design group into production  and current scheduled orders in backlog  an increase in edms sales for the first half of fiscal as compared to both the comparable period and second half of fiscal sales for our proprietary products segment were  for fiscal  which was a  or  decrease from sales of  in the prior fiscal year 
sales of our pipeline watchdog remote monitoring equipment and related services were approximately  for the fiscal year  an increase of  or  from the fiscal year 
the increase in sales of remote monitoring equipment was the product of an increase in customer orders received and shipped as a result of increasing market share and introductions of new products into the market 
sales of remote monitoring equipment are expected to increase over the next few quarters as compared to the latter half of the recently completed fiscal year due to continued strong demand for our watchdogcp products  the introduction of new products into the marketplace  our continued expansion into new international markets  the addition of the sensorcast products and customers  and the addition of c ommunication products and database services for the energy sector from the recently announced technology license acquired from eurotech  inc sales of our radix rugged hand held computer hardware  peripherals and related services  including maintenance contract revenues  were approximately  a decrease of  or  from the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in sales was compared to the record deliveries of rugged hand held computer hardware and peripherals in the prior fiscal year that included a single order of approximately million 
this order for radix hardware was the initial phase of a larger project that we believe will periodically generate similar orders over the next few years 
the remaining decrease in sales during fiscal was the result of global economic conditions 
during the second fiscal quarter  we completed development of the newest model of the radix handheld computer  the model fw a nd have delivered these units to our customers over the past several months 
we expect that sales of the new fw will contribute to an increase in overall sales of radix products and services  and we expect to show slight increases in sales during the first half of the next fiscal year as compared to the comparable period of the prior fiscal year 
sales for our extremetag product line since the acquisition of mbbs assets on june  were approximately  the company anticipates that sales of our extremetag products will increase in the coming quarters as we continue to market our complete rfid solutions and continue to generate and receive customer inquiries and orders 
additional miscellaneous revenues earned between the edms and proprietary product segments  totaled approximately  for the fiscal year 
these revenues are related to service and repair  technical consulting fees  engineering services  and freight billings 
these sales totaled approximately  in the previous fiscal year 
additionally  we realized approximately  and  of management consulting fees during the fiscal years and  respectively 
the management consulting contract engaged us to manage and perform consulting services for mbbs during the period between the original announcement of the stock purchase agreement on march  and the signing and closing of the asset purchase agreement on june  total consolidated backlog at april  was approximately  an increase of approximately  or  from a total backlog of  on april  and an increase of  or  from a total backlog of  on january  the increase in the backlog is the result of increases in orders from current and new customers of our electronic design and manufacturing services as well as orders for our proprietary products 
edms orders typically are for shipments and services over a specified period of time or delivery schedule 
orders for our proprietary products are usually completed and shipped to the customer soon after the order is received 
some larger proprietary product orders will have specific delivery schedules that may be as far out as jun e or even unscheduled due to the availability of product  installation scheduling  or  in a few cases  the customer has not yet scheduled delivery 
these product orders  with future or unscheduled delivery dates  are calculated in consolidated backlog 
gross margin for fiscal  was of sales  or  compared to of sales  or  for fiscal the decrease in gross margin of  was primarily the result of the reduction in sales from fiscal to fiscal and its corresponding impact on production efficiency 
the gross margin for the edms business segment was  or of sales  a decrease of  from  or of sales  from the prior fiscal year 
a decrease of approximately  in edms gross margin resulted from lower sales volumes of almost during the current period and the associated effect on production efficiency 
gross margin for the proprietary products segment was approximately  or  for fiscal as compared to  or  for fiscal the decrease in gross margin dollars for our proprietary products and services was primarily driven by a decrease in radix product sales from the prior fiscal year that included a single delivery of approximately million in rugged hand held computers and peripherals offset by the addition and integration of two product lines acquired during the fiscal year 
the increase in gross margin percentage for fiscal resulted from the proprietary product mix and the underlying product margins  and the absence of the million radix single delivery sale at lower margin during the previous fiscal year 
we expect that consolidated gross margins over the next few quarters will remain in the range of to 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal sg a expenses were of sales for fiscal as compared to of sales for fiscal corporate expenses increased approximately  in fiscal as compared to fiscal mainly due to higher professional fees for accounting services  consulting fees and investor relations efforts during the year 
during fiscal  we recognized approximately  of expenses that were related to the mbbs integration and  of expenses related to the sensorcast integration 
these costs include personnel expenses  travel  and operating costs 
the integration costs for both sensorcast and mbbs will decrease as a result of the completion of the transitions of the operations to our facility in olathe  kansas 
these increases in sg a costs were offset by decreases in personnel and personnel related expenses of approximately  a  reduction of facility and office related costs partially as a result of sub leasing our office space in sandy  utah  decreases in support engineering expenses of  and a decrease in travel expenses of  the largest component of the decrease in sg a expenses during the period was a reduction in commissions of approximately  that was directly related to the radix product sales of million in the comparable period of the prior year 
sg a expenses over the next few quarters are expected to increase slightly over the previous periods as a result of our continued investments in people  systems and capabilities as evidenced by our acquisitions in fiscal  our previously announced technology licensing agreement with eurotech  inc for their scada communications gateway products  known as the director series  and our continued investments in new product development  marketing  and sales 
operating loss for fiscal was approximately  a change of  from operating income of  reported in fiscal financial expenses  including interest expense  were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
this decrease of  was due to an overall decrease in total outstanding borrowings compared to the previous fiscal year and a reduction in the interest rate paid on the line of credit as a result of the refinancing in late october during fiscal  there were no additional borrowings on the operating line of credit and  in payments that lowered the total amount outstanding to  the total amount of borrowing base for the line of credit as of april  was calculated as approximately  as of april   there was  outstanding in long term borrowings compared to  at april  these long term borrowi ngs represent the industrial revenue bonds related to the company s headquarters and production facility

operating activities 
our consolidated working capital increased approximately  from  in consolidated working capital at the end of the fiscal year to  at the end of the fiscal year

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we cannot ensure that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue from the manufacture of production units of electronic assemblies  liquid crystal displays  and our proprietary products including our remote monitoring equipment  rfid technology and solutions and our mobile computing products 
we also derive revenue from repairs and non warranty services  engineering design services  remote monitoring services and maintenance contracts 
production and repaired units are billed to the customer after they are shipped 
remote monitoring services and maintenance contracts are billed and the revenue recognized at the end of the month the services or maintenance periods are completed 
for customers that utilize t he company s engineering design services  the customer is billed and revenue is recognized after the design services or tooling have been completed 
we require our customers to provide a binding purchase order to verify the manufacturing services to be provided and to ensure payment 
typically  we do not have any post shipment obligations that would include customer acceptance requirements 
we do provide training and installation services to our customers and those services are billed and the revenue recognized at the end of the month after the services are completed 
revenue recognized is net of sales taxes remitted to the government 
inventory valuation 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out fifo method  or market value 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand  as well as other market considerations 
we make provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on our quarterly reviews of inventory quantities on hand and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
we review our inventory in detail on a quarterly basis utilizing a month time horizon 
individual part numbers that have not had any usage in a month time period are examined by manufacturing personnel for obsolescence  excess and fair value 
parts that are not identified for common use or are unique to a former customer or application are categorized as obsolete and are discarded as part of our quarterly inventory write down 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the reserve balance is analyzed for adequacy along with the inventory review each quarter 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer s financial condition and credit history  and current economic conditions 
receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
the majority of the customer accounts are considered past due after days 
interest is not charged on past due accounts for the majority of our customers 
warranty reserve 
we have established a warranty reserve for rework  product warranties and customer refunds 
we provide a limited warranty for a period of one year from the date of receipt of our products by our customers and we do offer extended warranties for additional purchase by our customers 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective products at no cost to the customer or refund the customer s purchase price 
the warranty reserve is based on historical experience and analysis of specific known and potential warranty issues 
the product warranty liability reflects management s best estimate of probable liability under our product warrantie s 
goodwill 
goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
we do not amortize goodwill  but rather review its carrying value for impairment annually april  and whenever an impairment indicator is identified 
our annual impairment test is performed at year end 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step approach 
the first step is to identify if potential impairment of goodwill exists 
if impairment of goodwill is determined to exist  the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment using a fair value based approach 
intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of patents  trademarks  copyrights  customer relationships  trade name and technologies 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
impairment of long lived intangible assets 
long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be fully recoverable 
these events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration of operating results  changes in business plans  or changes in anticipated future cash flows 
if an impairment indicator is present  we evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less t han the carrying amount  we would recognize an impairment loss 
an impairment loss would be measured by comparing the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived assets and intangibles
