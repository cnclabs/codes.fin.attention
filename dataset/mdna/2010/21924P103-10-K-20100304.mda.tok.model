item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of our consolidated financial statements  including a brief discussion of our business and products  key factors that impacted our performance  and a summary of our operating results 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements due to important factors including  but not limited to  those set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
executive overview strategy we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring  developing and commercializing significant products for the respiratory and related markets 
our long term commercial strategy is to in license or acquire rights to non promoted or underperforming  patent or trade secret protected  branded pharmaceutical products that we can promote through our respiratory and hospital sales forces 
consistent with our respiratory focused strategy  we are also developing late stage cough cold product candidates to enhance our presence in the respiratory market 
although we have historically derived a large part of our revenues from branded  unbranded and authorized generic versions of products that have or had limited intellectual property protection  we consider these products to be non strategic because we expect the sales of these products to show a downward trend in the future 
we are therefore refocusing our efforts on growing our revenues from branded  patent or trade secret protected  respiratory and related products  which we consider strategic specialty products 
we believe that if we can successfully implement our refocused strategy we will be able to offset declines in other product sales and deliver more consistent long term earnings growth for our stockholders 
in we believe we made significant progress towards these goals 
in the third quarter of  we acquired an exclusive ten year license to the us commercial rights to chiesi s curosurf poractant alfa intratracheal suspension product 
in connection with the acquisition  we issued chiesi approximately million shares of our common stock  and we recorded product rights of million  which we will amortize over the life of the agreement 
with the addition of curosurf to our portfolio  in we invested in a hospital sales force to promote curosurf and any additional hospital products that we may acquire  and going forward we will continue to experience amortization expense related to the curosurf product rights and dilution related to the share issuance 
our challenges going forward will therefore include growing our sales of curosurf and acquiring other suitable hospital delivered products that will allow us to generate growth and value from our transaction with chiesi and our new hospital sales team 
if we can grow our sales of curosurf and acquire one or more additional hospital delivered products  we believe that the financial returns from hospital product sales including curosurf represent a key opportunity for future growth 
also during the third quarter of  we acquired the commercial rights to the antibiotic factive gemifloxacin mesylate 
we believe that factive offers significant opportunities for growth 
by promoting factive along with our products  spectracef and zyflo cr  we have the opportunity to leverage our respiratory sales force 
our ability to maximize the productivity of this team will be a key driver in the success of our strategy 
we expect our prospects for future growth in the respiratory market to be affected by our ability to manage seasonal fluctuations of demand for these products  the uncertainty surrounding the likely entry of generic versions of competing products into this market and with respect to factive  our ability to overcome a recent downward trend in demand for quinolone antibiotics 

table of contents during we also advanced our development pipeline  and in particular our four cough cold product candidates crtx  crtx  crtx and crtx 
we made a regulatory filing in july with the fda for crtx and we anticipate this will be the first of these products to be approved by the fda 
we believe that successfully validating our licensed technology and obtaining regulatory approval for these products are critical for us to achieve a competitive advantage and to translate that advantage into growth 
we plan to continue to invest in product development to realize the potential of these and other product candidates 
if we are unable to validate our technology platforms or if others develop similar platforms  our competitive advantage and prospects for future growth could be diminished 
we also expect to incur additional expenses to expand our sales team and marketing capabilities when product candidates are approved and add operational  financial and management information systems and personnel  including personnel to support our product development efforts 
although we are shifting our focus away from our non strategic products  we will continue to generate revenues from sales of these products without investing further resources in promoting them 
these products include the allerx dose pack products  the hyomax products and the propoxyphene acetaminophen products 
we expect sales of these products to trend downward  but in the near term we believe that they may generate significant cash  which we intend to use to fund future growth in our areas of strategic focus 
since we contract with third parties to manufacture all of our products and product candidates  and we do not plan to engage in any manufacturing for ourselves  our business is also affected by third party manufacturing and distribution costs and the cost of api 
changes in our mix of products sold will likely result in variations in our margins and cost of product sales 
managing relationships with our manufacturers and distributors will therefore continue to be a key area of focus for us 
highlights the following is a summary of key financial results and certain non financial results achieved for the year ended december  our net revenues for the year increased to million  of which the percentage of revenue derived from non strategic products declined from to  cash and cash equivalents increased million or to million at december  compared to million at december   we acquired an exclusive ten year license to the commercial rights to chiesi s lung surfactant curosurf in the united states  we acquired the commercial rights to the antibiotic factive in north america and certain countries in europe  and we made a regulatory filing with the fda in july for our product candidate crtx opportunities and trends in summary  during  we plan to continue to implement our strategy of combining organic growth  strategic acquisitions and product development 
as we do so  we will be evaluating our performance with particular reference to the following fiscal and management measures  which we believe will be drivers of our success sales growth of our strategic specialty products through our respiratory and hospital sales forces  cash generation from continued sales of our non strategic products  acquisition of rights to available and profitable new respiratory and related products with intellectual property protection  progress in the development of our product candidates  control of our manufacturing and general and administrative expenses  and

amortization of product rights increased million  or  during compared to this increase was primarily due to the amortization of zyflo cr and curosurf product rights 
we added zyflo cr to our product portfolio as a result of our merger 
we added curosurf to our product portfolio in july upon the closing of our strategic transaction with chiesi  and we began promoting and selling curosurf in september the increase in amortization was partially offset by a reduction in amortization expense related to balacet product rights which were fully amortized during other expenses 
total other expenses decreased million  or  during compared to this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net interest expense of  related to the conversion of our promissory note with carolina pharmaceuticals ltd  an entity controlled by certain of our executive officers  or the carolina note  into common stock on october  in connection with our merger

reconciliation of non gaap financial measures to supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap  we use non gaap measures of certain components of financial performance 
these non gaap measures include non 
table of contents gaap operating income  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share 
our management regularly uses supplemental non gaap financial measures to understand  manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions 
these non gaap measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods 
these non gaap measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative to  measures prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from similarly titled non gaap measures used by other companies 
in addition  these non gaap measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles 
the additional non gaap financial information presented herein should be considered in conjunction with  and not as a substitute for or superior to the financial information presented in accordance with gaap such as operating income  net income and earnings per share and should not be considered measures of our liquidity 
these non gaap measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures 
the non gaap financial measures reflect adjustments for stock based compensation expense  amortization of product rights and acquisition related expenses 
acquisition related expenses consist of certain expenses that were incurred in connection with the transaction with chiesi  including additional stock based compensation due to the accelerated vesting of certain stock options and shares of restricted stock resulting from the closing of that transaction 
we exclude these expenses from our non gaap measures because we believe that their exclusion provides an additional means to assess the extent to which our efforts and execution of our strategy are reflected in our operating results 
in particular  stock based compensation expense is excluded primarily because it is a non cash expense that is determined based on subjective assumptions  product rights amortization is excluded because it is not reflective of the cash settled expenses incurred related to product sales  and acquisition related expenses are excluded because they arise from prior acquisitions and management believes they have no direct correlation to current operating results 
our management believes that these non gaap measures  when shown in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures  enhance investors and management s overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future 
the non gaap measures are subject to inherent limitations because they do not reflect all of the expenses associated with the results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap and the exclusion of these expenses involved the exercise of judgment by management 
even though we have excluded stock based compensation expense  amortization of product rights and acquisition related expenses from the non gaap financial measures  stock based compensation is an integral part of our compensation structure  the acquisition of product rights is an important part of our business strategy and the transaction with chiesi resulted in significant cash expenses

see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for a description of the amounts due under the license agreement 
in addition to the material contractual cash obligations included the chart above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing  distribution and development agreements 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain development  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
we may be required to make additional payments of million if all milestones are met 
because the achievement of milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingent payments have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and have not been included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements  including structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues or results of operations since inception 
we expect our cost of product sales and other operating expenses will change in the future in line with periodic inflationary changes in price levels 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our property and equipment  we believe that the incremental inflation related to the replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources 
while our management generally believes that we will be able to offset the effect of price level changes by adjusting our product prices and implementing operating efficiencies  any material unfavorable changes in price levels could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and other financial information 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments based on available information and experience 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for a description of our significant accounting policies and method used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition net product sales product sales 
we recognize revenue from our product sales upon transfer of title  which occurs when product is received by our customers 
we sell our products primarily to large national wholesalers  which have the right to return the products they purchase 
we estimate the amount of future returns at the time of revenue recognition 
we recognize product sales net of estimated allowances for product returns  rebates  price adjustments  chargebacks  and prompt payment and other discounts 
when we implement a price increase  we generally offer our existing customers an opportunity to purchase a limited quantity of product at the previous list price 
shipments resulting from these programs generally are not materially in excess of ordinary levels  therefore  we recognize the related revenue when the product is received by the customers and include the shipments in estimating our various product related allowances 
in the event we determine that these shipments represent purchases of inventory in excess of ordinary levels for a given wholesaler  the potential impact on product returns exposure would be specifically evaluated and reflected as a reduction in revenue at the time of such shipments 
product returns 
consistent with industry practice  we offer contractual return rights that allow our customers to return the majority of our products within an month period  from six months prior to and up to twelve months subsequent to the expiration date of the products 
our products  except for curosurf  have a to month expiration period from the date of manufacture 
curosurf has an month expiration period from the date of manufacture 
we estimate our liability for product returns based on our estimate of inventory levels of our products in the distribution channel  the shelf life of the product shipped  review of consumer consumption data as reported by external information management companies  actual and historical return rates for expired lots  the remaining time to expiration of the product  and the forecast of future sales of the product  as well as competitive issues such as new product entrants and other known changes in sales trends 
we evaluate and adjust our estimate of product returns on a quarterly basis or as needed if we become aware of changes in such factors and if we believe they could significantly impact our expected returns 
expense recognized for product returns was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of gross product sales in  and  respectively 
expense recognized during for product returns related to current year sales was million  or of gross product sales 
expense recognized during for product returns related to 
table of contents changes in our prior year estimates was million and related primarily to an increase in our expected product returns of allerx df and allerx pe dose packs  spectracef mg and zyflo cr and zyflo 
the increase in returns is primarily due to the expiration dating of these products that were sold prior to in september  we also accrued million for potential returns of factive sold prior to our acquisition of the product rights 
rebates 
the liability for commercial managed care rebates is calculated based on historical and current rebate redemption and utilization rates with respect to each commercial contract 
the liability for medicaid and medicare rebates is calculated based on historical and current rebate redemption and utilization rates contractually submitted by each state 
expense recognized for rebates was million  million and  in  and  respectively  representing approximately  and of gross product sales in  and  respectively 
price adjustments and chargebacks 
our estimates of price adjustments and chargebacks are based on our estimated mix of sales to various third party payors  which are entitled either contractually or statutorily to discounts from the listed prices of our products 
these estimates are also based on the contract fees we pay to certain group purchasing organizations  or gpos  in connection with our sales of curosurf 
we make these judgments based on the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with gaap 
in the event that the sales mix to third party payors or the contract fees paid to gpos are different from our estimates  we may be required to pay higher or lower total price adjustments and or chargebacks than we have estimated 
from time to time  we offer certain promotional incentives to our customers for our products  and we expect that we will continue this practice in the future 
these programs include sample cards to retail consumers  certain product incentives to pharmacy customers and other sales stocking allowances 
we estimate our liability for each promotional program and record the liabilities as price adjustments 
as of december   we have three voucher programs whereby we offer a point of sale subsidy to retail customers 
we estimate our liability for these voucher programs based on the historical redemption rates for similar completed programs used by other pharmaceutical companies as reported to us by a third party claims processing organization and actual redemption rates for our completed programs 
expense recognized for price adjustments and chargebacks was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing approximately  and of gross product sales in  and  respectively 
the increase in the expense as a percentage of gross product sales during was primarily due to increased competition for hyomax and the addition of curosurf to our product portfolio  which caused higher levels of price adjustments and chargebacks 
prompt payment discounts 
we typically require our customers to remit payments within either or days  depending on the products purchased 
in addition  we offer wholesale distributors a prompt payment discount if they make payments within these deadlines 
this discount is generally  but may be higher in some instances due to product launches or customer and or industry expectations 
because our wholesale distributors typically take the prompt payment discount  we accrue of the prompt payment discounts  based on the gross amount of each invoice  at the time of our original sale to them  and we apply earned discounts at the time of payment 
we adjust the accrual periodically to reflect actual experience 
historically  these adjustments have not been material 
we do not anticipate that future changes to our estimates of prompt payment discounts will have a material impact on our net revenue 
expense recognized for prompt payment discounts was million  million and  in  and  respectively  representing approximately of gross product sales in each year
