our company we design  develop  manufacture and sell hard drives 
a hard drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic disks magnetic media to store and allow fast access to data 
hard drives are key components of computers  including desktop and notebook computers pcs  data storage subsystems and many consumer electronic ce devices 
we sell our products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers oems and original design manufacturers odms for use in computer systems  subsystems or ce devices  and to distributors  resellers and retailers 
our hard drives are used in desktop computers  notebook computers  and enterprise applications such as servers  workstations  network attached storage  storage area networks and video surveillance equipment 
additionally  our hard drives are used in ce applications such as digital video recorders dvrs and satellite and cable set top boxes stbs 
we also sell our hard drives as stand alone storage products by integrating them into finished enclosures  embedding application software and offering the products as wd branded external storage appliances for personal data backup and portable or expanded storage of digital music  photographs  video and other digital data 

table of contents hard drives provide non volatile data storage  which means that the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the device 
our hard drives currently include inch and inch form factor drives  having capacities ranging from gigabytes gb to terabytes tb  nominal rotation speeds up to  revolutions per minute rpm  and offer interfaces including enhanced integrated drive electronics eide  serial advanced technology attachment sata and serial attached scsi small computer system interface sas 
we also embed our hard drives into wd branded external storage appliances using interfaces such as universal serial bus usb  usb  external sata  firewire tm and ethernet network connections with capacities of gb up to tb 
in addition  we offer a family of hard drives specifically designed to consume substantially less power than standard drives  utilizing our wd greenpower technology tm 
we also design  develop  manufacture and sell solid state drives and media players 
a solid state drive is a storage device that uses semiconductor  non volatile media  rather than magnetic media and magnetic heads  to store and allow fast access to data 
we sell our solid state drives worldwide to oems and distributors for use in the embedded systems and client pc markets 
a media player is a device that connects to a user s television  the internet or home theater system and plays digital movies  music and photos from any of our wd branded external hard drives  other usb mass storage devices or content services accessed over the internet 
we sell our media players worldwide to resellers and retailers under the wd brand 
in november  we entered the traditional enterprise market with the wd s  inch  sas interface hard drives 
the wd s drive provides up to gb of storage suitable for both mission critical enterprise server and enterprise storage applications  as well as data centers and large data arrays
