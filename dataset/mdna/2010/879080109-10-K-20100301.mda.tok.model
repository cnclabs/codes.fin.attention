item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding our commercial industrial activity 

table of contents we lease certain portions of our land to oil companies for the exploration and production of oil and gas  but do not ourselves engage in any such exploratory or extractive activities 
as of december   approximately  acres were committed to producing oil and gas leases from which the operators produced and sold approximately  barrels of oil and  mcf of dry gas during our share of production  based upon average royalty rates during the last three years  has been   and  barrels of oil per day for   and  respectively 
approximately producing oil wells were located on the leased land as of december  royalty rates on our leases range from to 
estimates of oil and gas reserves on our properties are unknown to us 
we do not make such estimates  and our lessees do not make information concerning reserves available to us 
we have approximately  acres under lease to national cement company of california  inc  or national  for the purpose of manufacturing portland cement from limestone deposits found on the leased acreage 
national owns and operates a cement manufacturing plant on our property with a capacity of approximately  tons of cement per year 
the amount of payment that we receive under the lease is based upon shipments from the cement plant which  declined in the decline in shipments is the direct result of reduced construction activity due to the depressed real estate market 
the term of this lease expires in  but national has options to extend the term for successive periods of and years 
proceedings under environmental laws relating to the cement plant are in process 
see item  legal proceedings  for a further discussion 
joint ventures we are also involved in multiple joint ventures with several partners 
our ta petro joint venture owns and operates a acre travel and truck stop facility  and also operates three separate gas stations with convenience stores within tic west 
during  ta petro completed construction of a new travel plaza on acres in tic east which began operation in december we are involved in two joint ventures with rockefeller development group  the five west parcel llc which owns a  square foot building in tic west  which is partially leased  and the west llc which owns acres of land for future development within tic west 
resort residential our resort residential segment activities include land planning and entitlement and land stewardship activities 
we have two major resort residential communities within this segment  one of which tmv received county entitlement approvals in and one of which the centennial community is still progressing through the entitlement process in los angeles county 
the entitlement process precedes the regulatory approvals necessary for land development and routinely takes several years to complete 
the conservation agreement that we signed in is designed to minimize the opposition from environmental groups to these projects and eliminate or reduce the time spent in litigation once governmental approvals are received 
litigation by environmental groups has been a primary cause of delay and loss of financial value for real estate development projects in california 
centennial community the centennial development is a large master planned community development encompassing approximately  acres of our land within los angeles county 
upon completion of centennial  it is estimated that the community will include approximately  homes 
the 
table of contents community will also incorporate business districts  schools  retail and entertainment centers  medical facilities and other commercial office and light industrial businesses that  when complete  would create a substantial number of jobs 
centennial is being developed by centennial founders  llc  a consolidated joint venture in which we have a ownership interest as of december  our partners in this joint venture are pardee homes  lewis investment company and standard pacific corp 
in our partners in centennial founders llc elected to become non contributing capital partners due to the financial difficulties facing homebuilders and the current recession within the real estate industry 
as a result the company began funding of centennial founders llc s current operations  thereby diluting each other partner s percentage ownership 
this change in funding occurred in july prior to that time the company was contributing of the capital funds necessary to pursue entitlement and development efforts undertaken by this joint venture 
we expect to continue funding all entitlement and pre development activities for the near future 
since the initial submittal of our administrative level eir with respect to the centennial community to los angeles county  we have continued to receive feedback from the los angeles planning department and have submitted several revisions of our administrative eir as we work towards the public filing of our eir and final approval 
we cannot estimate when or if this approval will be granted  but the process is being actively pursued 
in addition to the eir  we have submitted a variety of other reports required as part of the entitlement process including our specific plan  tentative tract maps  geological reports  traffic reports  and water supply assessment reports 
centennial is envisioned to be an ecologically friendly and commercially viable development 
our plan is for a sustainable program that provides for the needs of the community while protecting the environment and will be achieved through our continuing focus on responsible use of limited resources and progressive construction design 
we recognize the need to balance expensive green program certifications with the practicality of investing those same funds in environmentally sound building elements 
tejon mountain village community in addition to the centennial community project  we are currently engaged in the development of tmv 
tmv is envisioned as an exclusive  very low density  resort based community that will provide owners and guests with a wide variety of recreational opportunities  lodging and spa facilities  world class golf facilities  a range of housing options  and other exclusive services and amenities that are designed to distinguish tmv as the resort of choice for the southern california market 
tmv is being developed by tmv llc  an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a ownership interest 
our partner in this joint venture is dmb tmv llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of dmb associates inc  or dmb  which is a leading resort recreational planned community developer 
under the joint venture agreement  the parties have agreed to secure all entitlements and all necessary regulatory approvals  to master plan  develop and sell parcels and homes to end users  and to develop and own  sell or joint venture commercial properties  hotels  and golf course sites in tmv 
in  the company contributed rights to all studies  research  and other work that we had performed related to tmv to the joint venture and committed to contribute  acres comprising the tmv site at such time as entitlements are successfully obtained and litigated  while dmb committed up to a total of at least  to fund entitlement efforts and development 
beginning in  based on the achievement of entitlement contribution levels by dmb  we began equal sharing of all funding requirements for entitlement and development activities with dmb 

table of contents in october tmv received unanimous entitlement approval from the kern county board of supervisors which allows the company to commence development activities 
this approval began a thirty day period in which a ceqa lawsuit could be filed against kern county 
these lawsuits routinely allege inadequacy of the eir 
as expected  a group of parties led by cbd filed a suit in november alleging inadequacy of the eir 
we plan to actively support the county in the legal defense of the eir and expect the suit to go to trial in we expect the plaintiffs to appeal in the event they do not prevail 
it is difficult to predict the ultimate timing of the settlement of the suit or the eventual outcome of the suit and subsequent appeal 
see item  legal proceedings  for a further discussion 
because our residential housing communities  centennial and tmv  are both in the entitlement phase  they have not been directly impacted by the current downturn in the housing market or the tight credit markets 
however  we cannot project the condition of the housing market or the stability of the mortgage industry when we have secured full entitlement for our projects  or when these projects move into their development and marketing phases 
these factors can impact the timing of beginning of development 
the sale and leasing of commercial industrial real estate is very competitive  with competition coming from numerous and varied sources around california 
the degree of competition has increased due to the current economic climate which has caused an oversupply of comparable real estate available for sale or lease due to the decline in demand as a result of the recession and lack of active business expansion 
our ability to attract tenants due to preferential pricing is minimized due to price cutting by our most direct regional competitors in the inland empire region of southern california and areas north of us in the san joaquin valley of california 
the greatest competition for the centennial community will come from california developments in the santa clarita valley  lancaster  palmdale  and bakersfield 
tmv will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes  so its competition will range over a greater area and range of projects 
farming operations in the san joaquin valley  we farm permanent crops including the following acreage wine grapes  almonds  and pistachios  we manage the farming of alfalfa and forage mix on acres in the antelope valley and we periodically lease acres of land that is used for the growing of vegetables 
we sell our farm commodities to several commercial buyers 
as a producer of these commodities  we are in direct competition with other producers within the united states and throughout the world 
prices we receive for our commodities are determined by total industry production and demand levels 
we attempt to improve price margins by producing high quality crops through proven cultural practices and by obtaining better prices through marketing arrangements with handlers 
sales of our grape and pistachio crops typically occur in the third and fourth quarter of the calendar year  while sales of our almond crop also typically occur in the third and fourth quarter of the year  but can occur up to a year or more after the crop is harvested 

table of contents in  we sold of our grape crop to one winery  to a second winery and the remainder to two other customers 
these sales are under long term contracts ranging from one to thirteen years 
our almonds were sold to various commercial buyers  with the two largest buyers accounting for and  respectively of our almond revenues and two remaining customers each accounting for of sales 
the majority of our pistachios were sold to two customers  with the larger customer purchasing approximately of the crop 
we do not believe that we would be adversely affected by the loss of these large buyers because of the markets for these commodities  the large number of buyers that would be available to us  and the fact that the prices for these commodities do not vary based on the identity of the buyer or the size of the contract 
nut and grape crop markets are particularly sensitive to the size of each year s world crop and the demand for those crops 
large crops in california and abroad can rapidly depress prices 
crop prices  especially almonds  are also adversely affected by a strong us dollar which makes us exports more expensive and decreases worldwide demand for us product 
the relatively weak value of the dollar in has helped to maintain strong almond prices in the us and in overseas markets 
our water entitlement for available from the california state water project  or swp  when combined with supplemental water  was adequate for our farming needs 
the state department of water resources  or dwr  has announced its early estimated water supply delivery at only of full entitlement 
this allocation alone is insufficient for our farming needs  however  combined with other water supplies that local water districts may be able to make available to farmers  groundwater sources  and water banking arrangements  we expect to have a level of water supply in that will meet all of our farming requirements 
water from these supplemental sources may be more expensive than water available from the swp because of pumping costs and transfer costs  but is expected to make up for the swp water shortfalls that we may experience during the coming year

item a 
risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
if any of the following risks occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations or future prospects could be materially adversely affected 
our strategy  focused on more aggressive development of our land  involves significant risk and could result in operating losses 
we are involved in a cyclical industry and are affected by changes in general and local economic conditions 
the real estate development industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  including employment levels availability of financing interest rates consumer confidence demand for the developed product  whether residential or industrial supply of similar product  whether residential or industrial the process of development of a project begins and financial and other resources are committed long before a real estate project comes to market  which could occur at a time when the real estate market is depressed 
it is also possible in a rural area like ours that no market for the project will develop as projected 
a prolonged recession in the national economy  or a further downturn in national or regional economic conditions  could continue to adversely impact our business 
the collapse of the housing market in and  together with the crisis in the credit markets  resulted in a recession in the national economy 
at such times  potential home buyer and commercial real estate customers often defer or avoid real estate transactions due the substantial costs involved and uncertainties in the economic environment 
our future real estate sales  revenues  financial condition and results of operations could suffer as a result 
our business is especially sensitive to economic conditions in california  where all of our land is located 

table of contents while there have been some signs of improvement over the last six months california  as one of the hardest hit states  could take longer to recover than the rest of the nation 
a prolonged downturn will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
higher interest rates and lack of available financing can have significant impacts on the real estate industry 
higher interest rates generally impact the real estate industry by making it harder for buyers to qualify for financing  which can lead to a decrease in the demand for residential  commercial or industrial sites 
any decrease in demand will negatively impact our proposed developments 
lack of available credit to finance real estate purchases can also negatively impact demand 
any downturn in the economy or consumer confidence can also be expected to result in reduced housing demand and slower industrial development  which would negatively impact the demand for land we are developing 
we are subject to various land use regulations and require governmental approvals for our developments that could be denied 
in planning and developing our land  we are subject to various local  state  and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning zoning  infrastructure design  subdivision of land  and construction 
all of our new developments require amending existing general plan and zoning designations  so it is possible that our entitlement applications could be denied 
in addition  the zoning that ultimately is approved could include density provisions that would limit the number of homes and other structures that could be built within the boundaries of a particular area  which could adversely impact the financial returns from a given project 
in addition  many states  cities and counties including neighboring ventura county have in the past approved various slow growth or urban limit line measures 
if that were to occur in the jurisdictions governing the company s land use  our future real estate development activities could be significantly adversely affected 
third party litigation could increase the time and cost of our development efforts 
the land use approval processes we must follow to ultimately develop our projects have become increasingly complex 
moreover  the statutes  regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals 
as a result  the prospect of third party challenges to planned real estate developments provides additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements 
third party challenges in the form of litigation could result in denial of the right to develop  or would  by their nature  adversely affect the length of time and the cost required to obtain the necessary approvals 
in addition  adverse decisions arising from any litigation would increase the costs and length of time to obtain ultimate approval of a project and could adversely affect the design  scope  plans and profitability of a project 
we are subject to environmental regulations and opposition from environmental groups that could cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such development entirely 
environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site s location and condition  present and former uses of the site  and the presence or absence of sensitive elements like wetlands and endangered species 
federal and state environmental laws also govern the construction and operation of our projects and require compliance with various environmental regulations  including analysis of the environmental impact of our projects and evaluation of our reduction in the projects carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions 

table of contents environmental laws and conditions may result in delays  cause us to incur additional costs for compliance  mitigation and processing land use applications  or preclude development in specific areas 
in addition  in california  third parties have the ability to file litigation challenging the approval of a project  which they usually do by alleging inadequate disclosure and mitigation of the environmental impacts of the project 
while we have worked with representatives of various environmental interests and wildlife agencies to minimize and mitigate the impacts of our planned projects  certain groups opposed to development have made clear they intend to oppose our projects vigorously  so litigation challenging their approval is expected 
the issues most commonly cited in opponents public comments include the poor air quality of the san joaquin valley air basin  potential impacts of projects on the california condor and other species of concern  the potential for our lands to function as wildlife movement corridors  potential impacts of our projects on traffic and air quality in los angeles county  emissions of greenhouse gases  water availability and criticism of proposed development in rural areas as being sprawl 
in addition  california has a specific statutory and regulatory scheme intended to reduce green house gas emissions in the state and current efforts to enact federal legislation to address climate change concerns could require further reductions in our projects carbon footprint in the future 
constriction of the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our cost of capital 
during this economic downturn  we have relied principally on positive operating cash flow and cash and investments to meet our working capital needs and fund development and entitlement activities 
however  the ongoing economic and real estate downturn has reduced other sources of liquidity available to us  and may continue to limit these other sources of liquidity in the future and potentially increase our costs of capital 
we are currently working on the renewal of our line of credit and given the current economic environment we expect that we will see some change from the prior terms of our line of credit such as higher financing costs 
not having a credit line in place could reduce our flexibility in responding to or taking advantage of future opportunities 
until governmental entitlements are received  we will have a limited inventory of real estate 
each of our four current and planned real estate projects  tic west and east  centennial and tmv  involve obtaining various governmental permits and or entitlements 
a delay in obtaining governmental approvals could lead to additional costs related to these developments and potentially lost opportunities for the sale of lots to developers and land users 
we are in competition with several other developments for customers and residents 
within our real estate activities  we are in direct competition for customers with other industrial sites in northern  central  and southern california 
we are also in competition with other highway interchange locations using interstate and state route for commercial leasing opportunities 
centennial ultimately would compete with other residential housing options in the region  such as developments in the santa clarita valley  lancaster  palmdale  and bakersfield 
tmv will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes  so its competition will include a greater area and range of projects 
intense competition may decrease our sales and harm our results of operations 
our developable land is concentrated entirely in california 
all of our developable land is in california and our business is especially sensitive to the economic conditions within california  any adverse change in the economic climate of california  which is currently in a recession  or our region of that state  and any adverse change in the political or regulatory climate of california  or the counties where our land is located could adversely affect our real estate development activities 

table of contents there is no consensus as to when the recession will end or how long it could take to recover from the recession 
ultimately  our ability to sell or lease lots may decline as a result of weak economic conditions or restrictive regulations 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects 
we currently depend heavily on the services of robert a 
stine  our president and chief executive officer  and a number of other key management personnel 
the loss of mr 
stine s services or that of other key personnel could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  or our ability to pursue land development 
our success will also depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel 
our business model is very dependent on transactions with strategic partners 
we may not be able to successfully attract desirable strategic partners complete agreements with strategic partners and or manage relationships with strategic partners going forward  any of which could adversely affect our business 
for several years a key to our development and value creation strategies has been the use of joint ventures and strategic relationships 
these joint venture partners bring development experience  industry expertise  financial resources  financing capabilities  brand recognition and credibility or other competitive assets 
a complicating factor in any joint venture is that strategic partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or that are influenced by factors related to our business 
these competing interests lead to the difficult challenges of successfully managing the relationship and communication between strategic partners and monitoring the execution of the partnership plan 
we may also be subject to adverse business consequences if the market reputation or financial position of the strategic partner deteriorates 
if we cannot successfully execute transactions with strategic partners  our business could be adversely affected 
only a limited market exists for our common stock which could lead to price volatility 
the limited trading market for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated  leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market of our common stock 
concentrated ownership of our common stock creates a risk of sudden change in our share price 
as of february   directors and members of our executive management team beneficially owned or controlled approximately of our common stock 
investors who purchase our common stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our common stock 
the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the registration of any significant amount of additional shares of our common stock will have the immediate effect of increasing the public float of our common stock and any such increase may cause the market price of our common stock to decline or fluctuate significantly 
inflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
inflation can have a major impact on our farming operations 
the farming operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues due to an oversupply of certain crops and very high irrigation water costs 
high fixed water costs related to our farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings 
prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and 
table of contents commodity prices 
therefore  it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue  just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation  except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices 
within our real estate operations  inflation can result in increased costs of construction and can reduce operating margins as increases in operating costs result in deteriorating margins on long term fixed lease agreements 
a prolonged downturn in the real estate market or continued instability in the mortgage and commercial real estate financing industry  could have an adverse effect on our real estate business 
our residential housing projects  centennial and tmv  are currently in the entitlement phase  and therefore they have not been impacted by the current downturn in the housing market or the mortgage lending crisis 
however  if the downturn in the real estate market or the instability in the mortgage and commercial real estate financing industry exists at the time these projects move into their development and marketing phases  our resort residential business could be adversely affected 
excess supply of homes available due to foreclosures or the expectation of deflation in housing prices could also have a negative impact on our ability to sell our inventory when it becomes available 
the inability of potential commercial industrial clients to get adequate financing for the expansion of their businesses could lead to reduced lease revenues and sales of land within our industrial development 
we may encounter other risks that could impact our ability to develop our land 
we may also encounter other difficulties in developing our land  including difficulty in securing adequate water resources for future developments  natural risks  such as geological and soil problems  earthquakes  fire  heavy rains and flooding  and heavy winds  shortages of qualified trades people  reliance on local contractors  who may be inadequately capitalized  shortages of materials  and increases in the cost of certain materials

item properties our approximate  acres include portions of the san joaquin valley  portions of the tehachapi mountains and portions of the western end of the antelope valley 
a number of key transportation and utility facilities cross our land  including interstate  california highways  and  the california aqueduct which brings water from northern california  and various transmission lines for electricity  oil  natural gas and communication systems 
our corporate offices are located on our property 
approximately  acres of our land are located in kern county  california 
the kern county general plan  or the general plan  for this land contemplates continued commercial  resource utilization  farming  grazing and other agricultural uses  as well as certain new developments and uses  including residential and recreational facilities 
while the general plan is intended to provide 
table of contents general guidelines for land use and development  it is subject to amendment to accommodate changing circumstances and needs 
in addition to conforming to any amendment of the general plan  much of our land will require specific zoning and site plan approvals prior to actual development 
the remainder of our land  approximately  acres  is in los angeles county 
this area is accessible from interstate via highway los angeles county has adopted general plan policies that contemplate future residential development of portions of this land  subject to further assessments of environmental and infrastructure constraints 
we are currently pursuing entitlements for the centennial master planned community on approximately  acres of this land 
see item  business real estate operations 
portions of our land consist of mountainous terrain  much of which is not presently served by paved roads or by utility or water lines 
much of this property is included within the conservation agreement 
as we receive entitlement approvals over the life span of our developments we will dedicate conservation easements on  acres of this land  which will preclude future development of the land 
this acreage includes many of the most environmentally sensitive areas of our property and is home to many plant and wildlife species whose environments will remain undisturbed 
any significant development on our currently undeveloped land would involve the construction of roads  utilities and other expensive infrastructure and would have to be done in a manner that accommodates a number of environmental concerns  including endangered species  wetlands issues  and greenhouse gas emissions  which may limit development of portions of the land or result in substantial delays or certain changes to the scope of development in order to obtain governmental approval 
water operations our existing long term water contracts with the wheeler ridge maricopa water storage district  or wheeler ridge  provide for water entitlements and deliveries from the swp  to our agricultural operations in the san joaquin valley 
the terms of these contracts extend to under the contracts  we are entitled to annual water for  acres of land  which is adequate for our present farming operations 
in addition to our agricultural contract water entitlements  we have an additional water entitlement from the swp sufficient to service a substantial amount of future residential and or commercial development in kern county 
the tejon castac water district  or tejon castac  a local water district serving only our land and land we have sold in tic  has  acre feet of swp entitlement 
in addition  tejon castac has approximately  acre feet of water stored in kern county water banks 
both the entitlement and the banked water are the subject of a long term water supply contract extending to between tejon castac and our company 
tejon castac is the principal water supplier to tic  and would be the principal water supplier for any significant residential and recreational development in tmv 
we have constructed a acre water bank consisting of nine ponds on our land in southern kern county 
water is pumped into these ponds and then percolates into underground aquifers 
since  we have purchased  acre feet of water from the antelope valley east kern water agency  or avek  which has been pumped from the california aqueduct and is currently 
table of contents retained in this water bank 
in and we contracted for  additional acre feet of water from avek  but have deferred delivery of the water to a future year 
we anticipate adding additional water to the water bank in the future as water is available 
in we began participating in the newly formed avek in lieu water banking program and we have acre feet of water to our credit in this program 
in recent years we have been purchasing water for our future use or sale 
in we purchased  acre feet of transferable water and in we purchased an additional  acre feet of water  all of which is currently held on our behalf by the antelope valley east kern water agency  or avek 
we are also eligible to receive water under long term water contract agreements that we have with the tulare lake water district 
these contracts are to supply  acre feet of water  subject to swp allocations  and the contracts run through during  swp allocations were  and wheeler ridge was able to supply us with of our farming demands through supplemental water it provided principally from water banks 
in some years  there is also sufficient runoff from local mountain streams to allow us to capture some of this water in reservoirs and utilize it to offset some of the swp water 
both wheeler ridge and tejon castac are able to bank percolate into underground aquifers some of their excess supplies for future use 
at this time  wheeler ridge expects to be able to deliver our entire contract water entitlement in a year that the swp deliveries exceed by drawing on its ground water wells and water banking assets 
based on historical records of water availability  we do not believe we have material problems with our water supply 
however  if swp deliveries are less than of our entitlement in any year  or if shortages continue for a sustained period of several years  then wheeler ridge may not be able to deliver of our entitlement and we will have to rely on our own ground water sources  mountain stream runoff  water transfer from others  and water banking assets to supply the needs of our farming and development activities 
water from these sources may be more expensive than swp water because of pumping costs and or transfer costs 
a preliminary swp water allocation has been made by the dwr for the water contracts with wheeler ridge and with tejon castac require annual payments related to the fixed costs of the california state water project and each district  whether or not water is used or available 
wheeler ridge contracts also establish a lien on benefited land 
although no assurance has been given  the water agency serving the los angeles county portion of our land  avek  has indicated  based on water availability that it could possibly provide a portion of the water needed for centennial 
portions of our property also have available groundwater which we believe would be sufficient to supply commercial development in the interstate corridor 
ground water in the antelope valley basin is the subject of litigation 
see item  legal proceedings 
there have been many environmental challenges regarding the movement of state project water through the sacramento delta 
these challenges resulted in a temporary court ordered shut down of the delta pumps  which are of primary importance to the california water system because these pumps are part of the system that moves water from northern california to southern california 
new biological opinions  or bos  issued by the us fish and wildlife service and national marine fisheries service in and contain similar restrictions on pumping from the delta 
these new bos are being challenged in the courts by both water agencies and environmental groups 
there are many groups  governmental and private  working together to develop a solution in the near future to alleviate the curtailment of water from the delta 

table of contents historic swp restrictions on the right to use agricultural water entitlement for municipal purposes were removed in  and the parties to a lawsuit challenging such removal have agreed to a settlement which would allow such removal to continue while the environmental impacts are studied 
for this purpose  municipal use includes residential and industrial use 
therefore  although only  of tejon castac s  acre feet of entitlement are labeled for municipal use  there is no practical restriction on tejon castac s ability to deliver the remaining water to residential or commercial industrial developments 
in the near term  for political and regulatory reasons  it is unlikely that we would be able to direct any of our wheeler ridge agricultural entitlement to municipal or industrial uses 
other activities the tejon ranch public facilities financing authority community facilities district  or cfd  a joint powers authority formed by kern county and tejon castac  has placed liens on  acres of the company s land 
these liens are to secure payment of special taxes related to  of bond debt sold by the cfd 
the company is obligated  as a landowner in the district  to pay its share of the special taxes assessed each year 
the  acres of land includes tic west 
proceeds from the sale of cfd bonds are used to reimburse the company for public infrastructure related to tic west 
in we received  of reimbursement from these bond funds while in  we did not receive any reimbursement from these bond funds 
in   and  we paid approximately   and  respectively  in special taxes related to the cfd 
as development continues to occur at tic  new owners of land and new lease tenants  through triple net leases  will bear an increasing portion of the assessed special tax 
as this happens  our obligation is reduced 
it is expected that we will have special tax payments in of approximately  but this could change in the future based on the amount of bonds outstanding within the cfd and the amount of taxes paid by others

on november  a group consisting of the center for biological diversity  wishtoyo foundation  tri county watchdogs and the center on race  poverty and the environment filed an action in kern superior court under the california environmental quality act  or ceqa  against kern county and the kern county board of supervisors  collectively  the county  concerning the county s granting of approval for tmv including the certification of the eir  approval of associated general plan amendments  adoption of associated zoning maps  adoption of special plan no 
 map  exclusion from agricultural preserves nos and  and approval of vesting tentative tract maps and  among other associated approvals 
tmv is named as the real party in interest 

table of contents the action alleges that the county failed to properly follow the procedures and requirements of ceqa including failure to identify  analyze and mitigate impacts to air quality  biological resources  hydrology and water quality  traffic  cultural resources  hazards  and failure to adequately describe the project and the environmental setting 
the action also alleges that the county violated the planning and zoning law and the kern county general plan 
the company is not aware of any such failures on the part of the county and believes the eir fully addresses all environmental impacts of the project including those specifically cited in the legal action 
the company is actively involved through the tmv joint venture in supporting the county as it defends the approval of the project 
the case is expected to go to trial in we expect the plaintiffs to appeal in the event they do not prevail 
the company will provide financial support through the tmv joint venture to the county in defense of their decision 
an additional suit was filed in federal court by an alleged representative of the kawaiisu tribe alleging that the company does not hold legal title to the land it seeks to develop 
the grounds for the federal lawsuit were the subject of a united states supreme court decision in where the court found in favor of the company 
centennial on february   an individual and a related limited liability company collectively burrows filed a lawsuit in los angeles county regarding the allocation of certain water  land and entitlement processing rights as between burrows  tejon and tejon s development partners for the centennial project in los angeles county 
the lawsuit arises from and relates to a settlement agreement involving a land swap  water rights and entitlement processing requirements relating to centennial and certain properties owned by burrows in the immediate vicinity of the centennial site 
a temporary restraining order tro was issued by the judge assigned to this lawsuit on february   that directs centennial to refrain in future communications with los angeles county from relying on groundwater used to irrigate a acre parcel as a water source for the centennial project 
the acre parcel is owned by burrows but leased and irrigated by tejon from off site wells owned by tejon 
centennial is in compliance with the tro 
the company  and its development partner centennial  are aggressively defending this lawsuit  following several months of unsuccessful settlement discussions with burrows 
the company has secured the services of an outside law firm to litigate this claim 
given the very short period since the filing of this lawsuit  the company has an insufficient basis to address the merits or potential outcomes of the burrows lawsuit 
the monetary value of a potential adverse outcome on the claim is likewise unknown

diesel fuel 
an order of the rwqcb directs lafarge  national and the company to clean up contamination from a diesel fuel tank and pipeline 
the company is advised that lafarge and national have substantially completed the groundwater cleanup and that groundwater monitoring remains an on going activity 
to date  the company is not aware of any failure by lafarge or national to comply with the orders or informal requests of the rwqcb 
under current and prior leases  national and lafarge are obligated to indemnify the company for costs and liabilities arising directly or indirectly out of their use of the leased premises 
the company believes that all of the matters described above are included within the scope of the national or lafarge indemnity obligations and that lafarge and national have sufficient resources to perform any reasonably likely obligations relating to these matters 
if they do not and the company is required to perform the work at its own cost  it is unlikely that the amount of any such expenditure by the company would be material 
antelope valley on november   a complaint was filed asking for the antelope valley groundwater basin to be adjudicated by the los angeles superior court 
this means that the rights of all parties overlying the basin  including the company s land  should be fixed based on various principles of water law and on negotiations among the principal parties or groups of water users 
because the case is still in the early stages and not yet at issue  it is too early to ascertain what effect  if any  this case may have on the centennial project or the company s remaining lands in the antelope valley 
because the water supply plan for the centennial project includes several sources of water in addition to groundwater underlying the company s lands  and because the creation of an efficient market for local water rights is frequently an outcome of adjudication proceedings  we anticipate that sufficient water to supply the centennial project s needs will continue to be available for its use

we are a diversified real estate development and agribusiness company committed to responsibly using our land and resources to meet the housing  employment  and lifestyle needs of californians and to create value for our shareholders 
in support of these objectives  we have been investing in land planning and entitlement activities for new industrial and residential land developments and in infrastructure improvements within our active industrial development 
our prime asset is approximately  acres of contiguous  largely undeveloped land that  at its most southerly border  is miles north of los angeles and  at its most northerly border  is miles east of bakersfield 
our business model is designed to create value through the entitlement and development of land for commercial industrial and resort residential uses while at the same time protecting significant portions of our land for conservation purposes 
we operate our business near one of the country s largest population centers  which is expected to continue to grow well into the future 
we currently operate in three business segments commercial industrial real estate development and services  resort residential real estate development  and farming 
our commercial industrial real estate development and services generates revenues from building  grazing  and land lease activities  land and building sales  oil and mineral royalties and ancillary land management activities 
the primary commercial industrial development is tic 
the resort residential segment is actively involved in the land entitlement and development process internally and through joint venture entities 
its revenues are generated through farming activities within the centennial joint venture 
within our resort residential segment  the two active developments are tmv and the centennial master planned community 
farming produces revenues from the sale of winegrapes  almonds  and pistachios 
the conservation agreement we entered into with five of the major environmental organizations in june calls for the permanent protection of up to  acres of our land through phased dedicated conservation easements on approximately  acres of our land   acres of open space within permitted project areas  and an option for these groups to purchase conservation easements on an additional  acres of our land 
the optional purchase of the conservation easements must occur during a specified timeframe  and the lapse of that period of time without the execution of the purchase of all or some of the conservation easements will result in that land becoming available for future development 
the option period can be extended automatically for up to one additional year based on the timing of specified activities such as conservation easement negotiations and timing of completion of the appraisal process 
for we had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of  compared to net income of  in  a decline of 
the decline in net income resulted from decreased commercial industrial revenues  a decline in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures and reduced other income 
these declines were partially offset by lower operating expenses in the real estate segments and corporate 
table of contents operations 
in  revenues from operations fell  to  when compared to the primary driver of the decline in revenue was a reduction in commercial revenues of  resulting primarily from the absence of sales of developed and undeveloped land  when compared to we also experienced declines in oil royalties and a drop in percentage and straight line rents from our power plant lease with calpine 
expenses from operations decreased  in to  compared to the prior year largely due to the absence of cost of sales of land and a decline in corporate expenses the decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was the result of a decrease in earnings from our ta petro joint venture due to increased operating expenses and a decrease in earnings of our five west parcel joint venture as the building it owns and leases was partially vacant during the year 
corporate expenses declined in due to reduced compensation costs 
for we had net income of  compared to net income of  in  a decline of 
the decline in net income resulted from increased commercial industrial revenues being more than offset by decreased farming revenues  increased expenses  and a decline in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures 
in  revenues from operations grew  to  when compared to expenses from operations increased  in to  compared to the prior year largely due to cost of sales of land 
the growth in commercial revenues of  resulted primarily from sales of developed and undeveloped land  when compared to we also experienced increases in oil royalties and improved base and percentage rents from our power plant lease with calpine 
the decrease in our farming revenues was primarily due to decreased yields on our pistachio crop  the absence of walnut revenue  as our walnut crop was our final harvest of walnuts  and a decline in prices for our almond crop 
the large decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was the result of the sale of the industrial building owned by our tejon dermody joint venture in the building was sold in july  resulting in a gain of  before tax  of which we recognized  and which is included as equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures in the results 
corporate expenses remained consistent in while resort residential expenses increased in compared to due to additional employees hired in late during  we plan to continue to invest funds in our joint ventures and internally toward the achievement of entitlements for our land and for infrastructure development within our active industrial developments 
the process of securing entitlements for our land is a long  arduous process which could take several years 
the conservation agreement is designed to help minimize future legal delays that are often a part of this process 
during the next few years  our net income will fluctuate from year to year based upon commodity prices  production within our farming segment  and the timing of sales of land and the leasing of land within our industrial developments 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides a narrative discussion of our results of operations 
it contains the results of operations for each operating segment of the business and is followed by a discussion of our financial position 
it is useful to read the business segment information in conjunction with note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent 
table of contents assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimates that are likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  capitalization of costs  profit recognition related to land sales  stock compensation  our future ability to utilize deferred tax assets  and defined benefit retirement plans 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
see also note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company s revenue is primarily derived from lease revenue from our rental portfolio  royalty revenue from mineral leases  sales of farm crops  and land sales 
revenue from leases with rent concessions or fixed escalations is recognized on a straight line basis over the initial term of the related lease unless there is a considerable risk as to collectability 
the financial terms of leases are contractually defined 
lease revenue is not accrued when a tenant vacates the premises and ceases to make rent payments or files for bankruptcy 
royalty revenues are contractually defined as to the percentage of royalty and are tied to production and market prices 
our royalty arrangements generally require payment on a monthly basis with the payment based on the previous month s activity 
we accrue monthly royalty revenues based upon estimates and adjust to actual as we receive payments 
in recognizing revenue from land sales  the company follows the provisions in accounting standards codification  or asc  real estate retail land to record these sales 
asc provides specific sales recognition criteria to determine when land sales revenue can be recorded 
for example  asc requires a land sale to be consummated with a sufficient down payment of at least to of the sales price depending upon the type and timeframe for development of the property sold  and that any receivable from the sale cannot be subject to future subordination 
in addition  the seller cannot retain any material continuing involvement in the property sold  or be required to develop the property in the future or construct facilities or off site improvements 
there were no land sales in and we fully recognized the revenues from all land sales in as none of the requirements for deferral of revenue were present 
in  we recognized  of deferred land sale revenues based on the completion of contractual construction obligations 

table of contents at the time farm crops are harvested  contracted  and delivered to buyers and revenues can be estimated  revenues and any related inventoried costs are expensed  which traditionally occurs during the third and fourth quarters of each year 
it is not unusual for portions of our almond crop to be sold in the year following the harvest 
orchard almond and pistachio revenues are based upon the contract settlement price or estimated selling price  whereas vineyard revenues are recognized at the contracted selling price 
estimated prices for orchard crops are based upon the quoted estimate of what the final market price will be by marketers and handlers of the orchard crops 
this method of recognizing revenues on the sale of orchard crops is a standard practice within the agribusiness community 
for the orchard crops  we estimated almond revenue to be  or per pound on average  and pistachio revenue to be  or per pound on average 
these estimates not only impact the recorded revenues within our farming segment but also our recorded accounts receivable at december  over the last three years  prices received on almonds have ranged from to per pound 
pistachio prices over the last three years have ranged from to per pound 
if we were to assume that our above estimates for orchard crop revenues were changed to the upper end or lower end of the range we developed in the course of formulating our estimate  orchard crop revenues would have been reduced or increased by approximately  or of the total revenue estimate 
our final estimates were based on the midpoint of a range in which the upper and lower ends of the range were from the midpoint 
as an example  the range for almonds in was to per pound 
if we were to change our estimate of orchard crop revenues to the low end of the estimated range  there would be no material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
actual final orchard crop selling prices are not determined for several months following the close of our fiscal year due to supply and demand fluctuations within the orchard crop markets 
adjustments for differences between original estimates and actual revenues received are recorded during the period in which such amounts become known 
the net effect of these adjustments increased farming revenue by   and  in  and  respectively 
the adjustment in was due to  in additional bonus payments and price adjustments on pistachios and  in adjustments related to almonds as prices continued to increase prior to the contract settlement 
the large adjustment in was due to bonus payments received on pistachios of  and  from continuing price increases for almonds 
the adjustments in previous years were related to increases in almond  pistachio and walnut prices prior to the receipt of our final scheduled payments 
capitalization of cost the company capitalizes direct construction and development costs  including predevelopment costs  interest  property taxes  insurance  and indirect project costs that are clearly associated with the acquisition  development  or construction of a project 
costs currently capitalized that in the future would be related to any abandoned development opportunities will be written off if we determine such costs do not provide any future benefits 
should development activity decrease  a portion of interest  property taxes  and insurance costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization  and would be expensed as incurred 
allocation of costs related to land sales and leases when we sell or lease land within one of our real estate developments and we have not completed all infrastructure development related to the total project  we follow asc  real estate retail land  to determine the appropriate costs of sales for the sold land and the timing of recognition of the sale 
in the calculation of cost of sales or allocations to leased land  we use estimates and forecasts to determine total costs at completion of the development project 
these estimates of final development costs can change as conditions in the market and costs of construction change 

table of contents in preparing these estimates  we use internal budgets  forecasts  and engineering reports to help us estimate future costs related to infrastructure that has not been completed 
these estimates become more accurate as the development proceeds forward  due to historical cost numbers and to the continued refinement of the development plan 
these estimates are updated periodically throughout the year so that  at the ultimate completion of development  all costs have been allocated 
during and  per square foot of cost was allocated to land that was sold  leased  or contributed to joint ventures  as the cost of development at tic west 
costs for land within tic east are currently estimated at per square foot 
any increases to this estimate in future years will negatively impact net profits and liquidity due to an increased need for funds to complete development 
if  however  this estimate decreases  net profits as well as liquidity will improve 
we believe that the estimates used related to cost of sales and allocations to leased land is a critical accounting estimate and will become even more significant as we continue to move forward as a real estate development company 
the estimates used are very susceptible to change from period to period  due to the fact that they require management to make assumptions about costs of construction  absorption of product  and timing of project completion  and changes to these estimates could have a material impact on the recognition of profits from the sale of land within our developments 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our property and equipment and development projects for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets contained in our financial statements may not be recoverable 
the impairment calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted 
we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset will be its new cost basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset 
restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited 
we currently operate in three segments  commercial industrial real estate development  resort residential real estate development  and farming 
at this time  there are no assets within either of our real estate segments or our farming segment that we believe are in danger of being impaired due to market conditions 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is very susceptible to change from period to period  it requires management to make assumptions about future prices  production  and costs  and the potential impact of a loss from impairment could be material to our earnings 
management s assumptions regarding future cash flows from real estate developments and farming operations have fluctuated in the past due to changes in prices  absorption  production and costs and are expected to continue to do so in the future as market conditions change 

table of contents in estimating future prices  absorption  production  and costs  we use our internal forecasts and business plans 
we develop our forecasts based on recent sales data  historical absorption and production data  input from marketing consultants  as well as discussions with commercial real estate brokers and potential purchasers of our farming products 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
defined benefit retirement plans the plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plan are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using level one indicators which are market prices for the investments 
pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial models 
the estimation of our pension obligations  costs and liabilities requires that we make use of estimates of present value of the projected future payments to all participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates  salary growth  retirement rates  expected contributions  inflation  expected return on plan assets  and mortality rates the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
in determining the discount rate  the company utilizes the yield on high quality  fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
at december   the weighted average actuarial assumption of the company s domestic plans consisted of a discount rate of  a long term rate of return on plan assets of  and assumed salary increases of 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax 
amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income are adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
if we were to assume a basis point change in the discount rate used  our projected benefit obligation would change approximately  stock based compensation we apply the recognition and measurement principles of asc  compensation retirement benefits in accounting for long term stock based incentive plans 
our stock based compensation plans have historically included both stock options and stock grants 
we have not issued any stock options to employees or directors since january  and our financial statements do not reflect any compensation expenses for stock options 
all of our stock 
table of contents options are fully vested and all related expenses were recognized in prior year financial statements per gaap 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  common stock and stock option information  for additional information regarding stock options 
we also make stock awards to employees based upon time based criteria and through the achievement of performance related objectives 
performance related objectives are either stratified into threshold  target  and maximum goals or based on the achievement of a milestone event 
these stock awards are currently being expensed over the expected vesting period based on each performance criterion 
we make estimates as to the number of shares that will actually be granted based upon estimated ranges of success in meeting the defined performance measures 
if our estimates of performance shares vesting were to change by  stock compensation expense would increase or decrease by  depending on whether the change in estimate increased or decreased shares vesting 
during  based on current estimates of future operating results and cash flow projections  we reversed  of performance based stock compensation expenses that had been recorded in prior years operating results because it is no longer likely that these shares will vest 
we also adjusted future expenses for other stock awards based on our current estimates of future results 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  stock compensation plan  for total stock compensation expense related to stock grants 
fair value measurements effective october   we adopted the fasb s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements of certain financial instruments 
the guidance defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the exchange exit price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
this guidance establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability 
observable inputs are those which can be easily seen by market participants while unobservable inputs are generally developed internally  utilizing management s estimates and assumptions level valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
level valuation is determined from quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  or by model based techniques in which all significant inputs are observable in the market 
level valuation is derived from model based techniques in which at least one significant input is unobservable and based on our own estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use to value the asset or liability 
when available  we use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value 
we consider the principal market and nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when determining the fair value measurement 
fair value measurements are used for marketable securities  investments within the pension plan and hedging instruments 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb revised the authoritative guidance for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  or vie 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities asu  which amends asc to replace the quantitative based risk and reward calculation for determining which entity has a controlling financial interest  to an approach that is primarily qualitative in its identification of controlling financial interest 
this statement requires an ongoing assessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
the change is effective as of the beginning of each entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november  we have reviewed this amendment and determined that implementation could potentially result in a future requirement to consolidate previously unconsolidated entities into our financial statements  but at this time we do not believe we have any additional vies that will be subject to consolidation 
such consolidations could materially impact our statement of operations and our financial condition positively or negatively in line with the entity being consolidated 
results of operations by segment we evaluate the performance of our operating segments separately to monitor the different factors affecting financial results 
each segment is subject to review and evaluation as we monitor current market conditions  market opportunities  and available resources 
the performance of each segment is discussed below real estate commercial industrial our commercial industrial segment profits during decreased to  a  decline  or  when compared to segment profits 
this decrease in segment profits was driven by the absence of land sales in compared to  and decreased royalties received on oil leases as oil production and prices fell compared to the record highs reached in the absence of land sales in accounted for a decline of  in the profitability of this segment compared to land sales profitability in in  land sales margins increased  compared to land sales profitability in 
in oil and mineral royalty margins decreased  overall compared to  with oil royalties decreasing by  and gas royalties decreasing by  while cement  sand and rock royalties decreased  oil production in decreased approximately  barrels compared to production while prices decreased per barrel on average compared to the prior year 
oil lease delay payments which are made to reserve future drilling rights on our land also declined as these parcels were developed into exploration wells 
mineral royalties declined as the demand for rock aggregate decreased reflecting the continued decline in the construction industry during a reduction in percentage rents and the reversal of straight line rental revenues from our calpine lease accounted for an additional decrease of  while ancillary land use revenues fell  as the constricted economy had a negative impact on revenue lines which are dependent on consumer discretionary spending 
these declines in revenue were partially offset by reduced expenses of  the absence of land sales resulted in a reduction in cost of sales in for land of  and a reduction in land sale related professional service costs of  the other major contributors to the reduction in expenses were an overall decline of  achieved through lower expenditures for materials and supplies  repairs and maintenance  travel  memberships  subscriptions and marketing programs at tic  and fuel costs  which fell compared to 
table of contents as prices for gasoline and underlying services dropped 
we abandoned a potential building expansion project in and wrote off the  of historical costs incurred on the project which increased current year costs and reduced the overall cost savings achieved by this segment 
we expect any continuation of the global and california economic downturn to have a negative impact on commercial industrial revenues in by severely limiting or eliminating future leasing and sales activities 
the downturn in the real estate industry is causing a lack of demand for new construction  and sales and leasing of industrial products 
recent increases in the price of oil over the last few months could positively impact our revenues during in  we completed the expansion of the laval interchange which facilitates increased traffic flow at our tic east development 
we also completed phase i infrastructure improvements which set the stage for the new ta petro travel plaza that was completed during in we plan to focus on the continued marketing and development of tic east and work to complete the build out of tic west 
our marketing efforts for tic east and west continue to focus on educating potential users about the logistical benefits of our site and the success that current tenants and owners within our development have experienced 
we believe california s long term projected population growth will help to drive increases in industrial activity at tic once the economic environment improves 
our development strategy has fit very well with the logistics model that companies have been using  which favors larger single site buildings rather than a number of decentralized smaller distribution centers 
buildings of million square feet or larger are difficult to build in los angeles due to the number of acres necessary for a building of that size 
our ability to provide land parcels to support buildings of that size provides us with a potential marketing advantage 
a potential disadvantage to our development strategy is our distance from the port of los angeles in comparison to the traditional warehouse distribution centers east of los angeles 
the downturn in the economy continues to have an adverse impact on our ability to sell or lease our industrial commercial product 
the sharp downturn in economic activity over the last two years has resulted in a marked decrease in potential tenant interest 
contraction of business operations has resulted in price cutting and significant increases in available warehouse space in the inland empire and other los angeles metropolitan areas 
this increased competition has negatively impacted our pricing advantages  and the lack of corporate business expansion due to future economic uncertainties has decreased demand for our buildings and land in the near term 
we expect the commercial industrial segment to continue to experience significant costs  net of amounts capitalized  primarily related to professional service fees  marketing costs  commissions  planning costs  and staffing costs as we continue to increase real estate activities and pursue development opportunities 
the actual timing and completion of development is difficult to predict due to the uncertainties of the market 
infrastructure development and marketing activities and costs could continue over several years as we develop our land holdings 
we will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best uses for our land holdings 
future sales of land are dependent on market circumstances and specific opportunities 
our goal in the future is to increase land value and create future revenue growth through planning and development of commercial and industrial properties 

table of contents our commercial industrial segment profits during increased to  an  improvement  or  when compared to segment profits 
this increase in segment profits was driven by the higher margins achieved on land sales in compared to  and the increased royalties received on oil leases as oil production and prices reached record highs in land sale margins improved  in on the sale of developed and undeveloped land 
two sales of developed land for a total of acres within tic west were completed with proceeds of  in  with one sale to an industrial warehouse developer and one to a hotel developer 
sales of  acres of undeveloped land with proceeds of  were also completed during oil and mineral royalty margins increased  overall  with oil royalties increasing by  while cement  sand and rock royalties decreased  oil production in increased  barrels over production while prices increased per barrel on average over the prior year 
mineral royalties declined as the demand for rock aggregate decreased reflecting the drop in the construction industry during a decline in ancillary land use revenues of  and increased commercial water costs of  offset some of the revenue increases described above 
additional increases in legal costs related to the land sales  insurance costs  fuel  and materials and supplies were offset by decreases in compensation costs as previously expensed stock performance awards were reversed based on revised estimates 
see item  business real estate operations for a further discussion of real estate development activities 
real estate resort residential our resort residential segment activities include land planning and entitlement activities related to our potential residential developments  which include the centennial master planned community and tmv 
each of our resort residential projects is being developed through a joint venture 
the intent of such joint venture agreements is to provide a source of capital and allow the significant costs and business risks inherent in these projects to be shared with our venture partners 
during our joint venture agreement with our centennial founders partners was amended to allow our partners to cease capital contributions during the entitlement phase of the project allowing us to continue as the sole funding participant 
in exchange for non contributing status  these partners percentage ownership interests are diluted by a to ratio with regard to the amount of capital contributed on such partner s behalf 
as a result of this partnership amendment the results of operations of the centennial founders joint venture are now consolidated within our financial statements 
during  we signed a conservation agreement with five major environmental organizations 
the organizations that signed the conservation agreement will not oppose our current residential developments 
these developments will continue to be subject to the regulatory requirements that are a part of the entitlement process and could be opposed by other parties 
however  we believe the conservation agreement will be beneficial in reducing future legal opposition and delays 
the resort residential segment had an operating loss of  in  an improvement of  or when compared to the prior year 
the decreased loss in was the result of recognition of  of revenue from the centennial founders partnership and containment of current year expenses even after the consolidation of centennial operations 
the primary drivers behind the containment in current year expenses were a  reduction in the public relations costs and a  overall reduction in compensation costs  net of amounts capitalized  as savings from staff reductions and decreased incentive compensation cost were 
table of contents recognized 
routine fuel  repairs and maintenance  travel and leasing costs declined as cost reduction efforts were implemented 
these cost savings were partially offset by increased contract and professional services costs as capitalized project costs are replaced by expensed implementation costs of the ranch wide agreement 
the centennial founders joint venture expenses of  also represent an increase in costs compared to as is the first year of consolidation of this joint venture 
we expect near term activities within this segment to be focused on obtaining entitlements for the centennial project  located in los angeles county  defending the legal challenges to the tmv eir  and stewardship activities 
the resort residential segment will continue to incur costs in the future related to professional service fees  public relations costs  and staffing costs as we continue the entitlement process for the above communities and continue to meet our obligations under the conservation agreement 
the actual timing and completion of entitlement related activities is difficult to predict due to the uncertainties of the approval process and the possibility of litigation upon approval of our entitlements in the future 
we will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best use for our land holdings 
our long term goal through this process is to increase the value of our land and create future revenue opportunities through resort and residential development 
the conservation agreement also provides for the sale of conservation easements over  acres of our land 
the price that will be received for these easements  if they are purchased  will be based upon an appraisal  which could be negatively impacted by current economic conditions 
since we are in the process of achieving entitlements for our centennial community  we do not have a fully approved project and therefore we do not have inventory for sale in the current market 
we received entitlement approval for our tmv community during  however there has been a legal challenge to those approved entitlements 
although this legal challenge does not preclude us from commencing the development of tmv  we generally believe it is more prudent to have law suits settled before beginning development 
we are continuously monitoring the markets in order to identify the appropriate time in the future to begin infrastructure improvements and lot sales 
our long term business plan of developing the communities of centennial and tmv remains unchanged 
the housing industry downturn has impacted the perception of current land values due to the numerous write downs home builders have taken regarding land inventory 
this perception of land value has impacted our stock price 
we believe the long term fundamentals which support housing demand  primarily california population growth and household formation remain positive 
however  it is not possible to predict how long the negative effects of the current market conditions will persist and if we will experience further deterioration from current levels or if conditions will improve 
the resort residential segment had an operating loss of  in  an increase of  or when compared to the prior year 
as this segment did not generate revenues in  the increased loss was the result of an increase in expenses as compared to the primary driver behind this increase was  of additional compensation costs including salary and stock compensation net of amounts capitalized for staff hired in late to oversee and manage our interest in our residential joint venture projects and to assist in implementing the conservation agreement

table of contents farming farming segment profits were  in  a decrease of  or  when compared to the prior year 
these comparable farming segment profits resulted from an overall increase in both revenues and expenses 
an increase of  in farm crop revenues was diluted by lower farming lease revenue and associated water sales 
farming expenses increased by  mainly as a result of  of additional fixed water costs as compared to grape revenues for the crop decreased  or  to  as compared to due to decreased production and lack of bonus payments for high sugar content 
sugar content of the grapes is impacted by the weather and timing of the grape harvest 
the higher sugar content of our crop triggered a bonus payment on our rubired varietal and resulted in a higher average price for our winegrape crop when compared to in  grape production decreased approximately tons as compared to as we removed vines in the region of tic east to make way for additional commercial real estate development 
we have long term contracts for our grape crops ranging from one to thirteen years 
grape prices are remaining relatively stable in spite of increased california production as new plantings from recent years have come into production 
the lack of water availability in california could impact production and crop prices in the future 
in  almond revenues increased  or  to  sales of current year crop accounted for  of revenues compared to current year crop sales in of  this increase was achieved through the sale of approximately  more pounds of almonds from the current year crop as compared to our almond revenues include  of revenue from the sale of and prior year crop almonds in as compared to  of farming revenues attributable to the sale of and prior year crop almonds 
these sales reflect amounts held in inventory at the end of the prior year and sold in the following calendar year 
we are carrying approximately  pounds of almonds in our inventory at december  which will be sold in almond prices have risen over the last several months but have stabilized in recent weeks 
current market prices exceed the carrying value of our inventory 
thus far in  the price for almonds has increased steadily due to the stable demand in us and world markets 
the current range of almond prices is to per pound depending on the variety 
as the value of the dollar was relatively weak against foreign currencies during most of the demand for us almonds grew 
the increased demand is primarily tied to almonds being less expensive for foreign buyers 
strengthening of the dollar and the continuing global downturn could result in downward pressure on prices and decreased demand for the product we are carrying in our year end inventory 
the value of the dollar has risen in early which could put downward pressure on demand and negatively impact the final prices we receive for our crop sales 
in pistachio revenues decreased  or  to  pistachio yields increased  pounds in compared to due to being an on production year in the alternate bearing production cycle for pistachios 
this increase in production was substantially less than the expected yield for an on production year  as many of the nut shells did not form fruit 
this resulted in a significant reduction in the pounds of edible nuts available for sale compared to our estimate 
the increase in yield in compared to was partially offset by a price decline from an average of per pound in to per pound in the price decline for pistachios is attributable to the larger worldwide crop 
we expect our revenues from 
table of contents pistachios to increase when compared to due primarily to higher production yields following this low on production year 
however a larger crop and the stronger us dollar could negatively impact the prices we receive in we removed our walnut orchard following the harvest due to declining production and have replanted the acreage with rubired grapes 
the following table reflects crop revenues in thousands for the last three years by variety of product and crop year 
production of almonds  pistachios and walnuts is stated in thousands of pounds and production of winegrapes is stated in thousands of tons

large crops in california and abroad can depress prices 
with current worldwide grape production more in line with worldwide demand  the pressure on prices has been alleviated at the present time and grape prices should remain at current levels 
our long term projection is that crop production  especially of almonds and pistachios will increase on a statewide basis over time because of new plantings  which could negatively impact future prices if the growth in demand does not keep pace with production 
while demand for product has been strong both in the united states and in export markets over the last 
table of contents few years  the increasing strength of the dollar and the current economic downturn has recently had a negative impact on the markets 
it is too early to project crop yields and what impact that may have on prices later in water delivery and near term water availability continues to be a concern within california 
the limitation of delivery of swp water and the absence of available alternatives during the current drought could potentially cause permanent damage to orchards and vineyards 
while we are impacted by this  we believe we have sufficient water resources available to meet our requirements in please see our discussion on water in item  properties water operations 
farming segment profits were  in  a decrease of  or  when compared to the prior year 
the decline in farming segment profits is due to decreased revenues of  and increased expenses of  the decrease in revenues was driven by lower yields for pistachios  lower almond prices  and the absence of walnut revenues as that orchard was replaced during with rubired grapes due to limited production in recent years 
expenses in our farming segment increased  primarily due to increased water cost of  from the use of more expensive supplemental water as compared to swp water and increased cultural costs as petroleum derived chemical costs increased 
grape revenues for the crop increased  to  as compared to due to increased production and higher crop prices 
grape production increased approximately  tons as compared to as our new vineyard which was planted in began production in additionally  the higher sugar content of our crop triggered a bonus payment on our rubired varietal and resulted in a higher average price for our grape crop when compared to we have long term contracts for our grape crops ranging from two to fourteen years 
almond revenues decreased  in to  sales of the crop accounted for  of revenues compared to year crop sales in of  this increase was achieved through the sale of approximately  more pounds of almonds from the current year crop as compared to our almond revenues included  of revenue from the sale of crop almonds in as compared to  of farming revenues attributable to the sale of crop almonds 
these sales reflect amounts held in inventory at the end of the prior year and sold in the following calendar year 
more pounds of prior year almonds were carried into than were carried into  reflecting the primary difference in prior year crop revenues 
we carried approximately  pounds of almonds in our inventory at december  which were sold in pistachio revenues decreased  in to  pistachio yields decreased  pounds in compared to due to being an off production year in the alternate bearing production cycle for pistachios 
this drop in yield was partially offset by a price increase from an average of per pound in to per pound in the price increase for pistachios was attributable to the smaller crop

equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures during  we recognized net earnings of  from unconsolidated joint ventures compared to net earnings of  during the largest single component of these earnings consisted of our portion of the equity in the earnings of ta petro of  the balance of the net earnings from joint ventures consisted of losses from five west parcel of  and losses from tmv llc of  also included in this amount is our share of the loss from the centennial founders operations for the pre consolidation period january  through june  of  after that date the results of operations of the centennial founders joint venture are consolidated due to amendments to the partnership agreement which qualified the joint venture for consolidation 
earnings from our ta petro joint venture declined  when compared to due to increased operating expenses 
earnings from ta petro could remain below historical levels during as additional expenses related to the new east side travel plaza reduce overall profitability 
new travel plaza facilities routinely take up to three years to achieve consistent profitability 
losses from the centennial and tmv joint ventures did not vary significantly from those incurred in within our centennial joint venture  our partners are pardee homes  lewis investment co 
llc and standard pacific 
we have stated in the past that the last three years have been extremely difficult for many homebuilders as they have seen their businesses decline and their internal financing become much more difficult to obtain as we discuss in our liquidity and capital resources disclosures 
we have also noted in our filings that if the real estate sector continued to be impacted 
table of contents by the economy it could become necessary for one or all of our current partners to leave the joint venture due to difficulty in meeting obligations related to future required capital contributions 
due to these circumstances the joint venture agreement was amended in august to allow our partners to become non funding members during the entitlement phase of the project while we continue as the sole funding partner 
during this period any non funding partner s percentage ownership interest will be diluted by a to ratio with regard to the amount of capital contributed on such partner s behalf 
consequently  the operating results of centennial founders were consolidated effective july  despite this change  our partners continue to be involved in an advisory capacity and may re elect contributing status at a later time 
at december  we have a ownership position in centennial founders 
please see our form q for the quarterly period ended june  filed with the sec on august  for further details on this agreement 
the  square foot building owned by our five west parcel joint venture was partially leased for a portion of the tenant increased its occupancy space and extended its lease in late we continue to work with our partners to lease the remaining space 
in november  the construction loan on the building was repaid as the required coverage ratio had not been achieved 
replacement financing is now being negotiated and we anticipate completing that transaction during the first half of during we contributed acres of land within tic west to a second joint venture with rockefeller development group 
this joint venture is west llc 
we received  of equity investment in the partnership in exchange for the property we contributed and our partner contributed  of cash to the joint venture which was subsequently distributed to the company

the largest single component of these earnings consisted of our portion of the equity in the earnings of ta petro of  the balance of the net earnings from joint ventures consisted of earnings from five west parcel of  losses from tmv llc of  losses from centennial founders of  and a loss of  on the dissolution of tejon dermody llc 
earnings from our ta petro joint venture continued to increase in due to higher fuel margins and improved operating efficiencies 
losses from the centennial and tmv joint ventures did not vary significantly from those incurred in income taxes for financial statement purposes  our effective tax rate for was after taking into consideration permanent and temporary timing differences 
our effective tax rate is impacted by the noncontolling interest held in the centennial founders partnership because income loss before income taxes includes losses allocable to the noncontrolling interest 
the tax benefit for was  during  our largest permanent tax difference was related to depletion allowances 
our tax benefit at december  is  additionally  temporary timing differences reduced our liability 
for  we had net deferred tax assets of  and a related allowance of  our largest deferred tax assets were made up of temporary differences related to the capitalization of costs  pension adjustments  stock grant expense  the land donation and deferred accounting gains on land sales 
deferred tax liabilities consist of depreciation  deferred gains  cost of sale allocations  and straight line rent 
due to the nature of most of our deferred tax assets  we believe they will be used in future years and an allowance is not necessary 
however  one deferred tax

liquidity and capital resources cash flow and liquidity 
our financial position allows us to pursue our strategies of land entitlement  development  and conservation 
accordingly  we have established well defined priorities for our available cash  including investing in core business segments to achieve profitable future growth 
we have historically funded our operations with cash flows from operating activities  cash and investments  and short term borrowings from our bank credit facilities 
in the past  we have also issued common stock and used the proceeds for funding needs 
to enhance shareholder value  we will continue to make investments in our real estate segments to secure land entitlement approvals  build infrastructure for our developments  ensure adequate future water supplies  and provide funds for general land development activities 
within our farming segment  we will make investments as needed to improve efficiency and add capacity to its operations when it is profitable to do so 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaled approximately  at december   a decrease of  or  from the corresponding amount at the end of cash and marketable securities decreased in due to a variety of factors 
significant cash inflows including net maturities of investment securities of  net borrowings of short term debt of  and reimbursement proceeds from the cfd bonds of  were more than offset by investments in property plant and equipment of  mainly in our real estate projects  investments in joint ventures of  and water purchases of the following table summarizes the cash flow activities for the last three years year ended december in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities our operations provided  of cash during which reflects a decline of  or  compared to cash provided by operations in the primary reason for the decrease in cash inflows from operations in compared to was our net operating loss of  and a decline in liabilities of  including trade payables  accrued liabilities and income taxes payable 
this cash outflow was mainly offset by non cash operating expenses of  including depreciation  retirement plan costs  abandonments  and stock compensation 
net cash provided by operations during decreased to  or  from  in  primarily as a result of the decrease in net income  the absence in of earnings distributions from joint ventures and payments of income taxes 
partially offsetting these decreases in were collections of receivables  reduction of inventory balances and increases in payables 

table of contents investing activities utilized  of funds in compared to  in and  in investments for these years were primarily dominated by investments in our real estate projects  investments in our joint ventures  water purchases and investments in our farming operations 
capital investments of  in include real estate projects of  compared to capital investments in of  which included real estate project investments of  the real estate project investments are primarily related to infrastructure development at tic and to the capitalization of costs related to our entitlement activities in our real estate projects which  in  included our conservation agreement 
we also invested cash of  in our tmv joint venture   in our five west parcel joint venture  and  in our centennial joint venture and made a non cash contribution of land with a book value of  to the west llc joint venture and a non cash contribution of  to our centennial joint venture 
of the  of cash invested in our centennial joint venture   was invested subsequent to its july  consolidation  therefore the amount presented as investments in joint ventures in our statement of cash flows is shown net of this amount 
we anticipate that our capital investment requirements for could be as high as  these estimated investments include approximately  of infrastructure and entitlement investment for real estate development projects and approximately  of investment within our operating and corporate operations for the replacement of equipment 
in we expect to contribute  to our various joint ventures and make other capital investments of  of this other capital investment amount  we expect approximately  will be invested in the purchase or conveyance of water inventory and drilling new wells or replacing existing wells 
we continue to add to our current water assets to help secure our ability to supply water to our farming and real estate activities and as a future investment  since we believe that the cost of water in california will continue to increase 
investments in water are expected to continue at varied levels in future years 
our funds provided by financing activities of  during resulted from net borrowings of  on our credit line and  from the exercise of stock options 
the funds were utilized as working capital for our operations and for contributions to our joint ventures 
distributions from our joint ventures and proceeds from the sale of securities were used to repay  of the borrowing 
we use this credit facility to fulfill cash needs that are not met by maturing securities or operating inflows due to the timing of those activities 
our funds provided by financing activities of  during resulted from borrowings of  on our line of credit and  of cash received from the exercise of stock options 
it is difficult to accurately predict cash flows due to the nature of our businesses and fluctuating economic conditions 
our earnings and cash flows will be affected from period to period by the commodity nature of our farming operations and the timing of sales and leases of property within our development projects 
the timing of sales and leases within our development projects is difficult to predict due to the time necessary to complete the development process and negotiate sales or lease contracts 
often  the timing aspect of land development can lead to particular years or periods having more or less earnings than comparable periods 
based on our experience  we believe we will have adequate cash flows and cash balances over the next twelve months to fund internal operations 
capital structure and financial condition 
at december   total capitalization was  consisting of  of debt and  of equity and resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of less than  which is a increase over the prior year s debt to total capitalization ratio 

table of contents we have a long term revolving line of credit of  that  as of december   had an outstanding balance of  and as of february  had an outstanding balance of  at the company s option  the interest rate on this line of credit can be fixed at over a selected libor rate or float at less than the bank s prime lending rate 
the interest rate on the line of credit is currently 
during the term of this credit facility which matures in september  we can borrow at any time and partially or wholly repay any outstanding borrowings and then re borrow  as necessary 
under the terms of the line of credit  we must maintain tangible net worth  defined as total stockholders equity plus debt less intangible assets  not less than  and working capital of not less than  at december  our tangible net worth was  and our working capital was  we did not meet the working capital covenant in our line of credit at year end 
our bank has provided a waiver for this covenant that includes no time limits to cure the working capital shortfall 
we are currently working with our bank on the renewal of this credit facility 
our expectations are that it will be renewed  but given the current economic environment we anticipate some changes to the terms in our renewal line of credit 
this line of credit is currently unsecured and we expect that our bank may require some level of collateral and possibly slightly higher financing costs upon renewal 
we anticipate the successful renewal of this credit facility 
not having a line of credit in place could reduce our flexibility in responding to  or taking advantage of  future opportunities such as build to suit opportunities at tic and similar activities within our tic joint ventures 
the outstanding long term debt  less current portion of  is  at december  this debt is being used to provide long term financing for a building being leased to starbucks and the debt is secured by the leased building and land

as noted above  we have  in cash and securities at december  and current availability on lines of credit to meet any short term liquidity needs 
we continue to expect that substantial future investments will be required in order to develop our land assets 
in order to meet these long term capital requirements  we may need to secure additional debt financing and continue to renew our existing credit facilities 
in addition to debt financing  we will use other capital alternatives such as joint ventures with financial partners  sales of assets  sales of easements  and the issuance of common stock 
there is no assurance that we can obtain financing or that we can obtain financing at favorable terms 
we believe we have adequate capital resources to fund our cash needs and our capital investment requirements as described earlier in the cash flow and liquidity discussions

based on this definition  the table above includes only those contracts that include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the ordinary course of business 
our cash contract commitments consist of contracts in various stages of completion related to infrastructure development within our industrial developments and entitlement costs related to our industrial and residential development projects 
at the present time  we do not have any capital lease obligations or purchase obligations outstanding 
our operating lease obligations are for office equipment  several vehicles  and a temporary trailer providing office space and average approximately  per month 
our financial obligations to the conservancy are prescribed in the conservation agreement 
our advances to the conservancy are dependent on the occurrence of certain events and their timing  and are therefore subject to change in amount and period 
the amounts included above are the minimum amounts we anticipate contributing through the year the obligation shown above represents eighty percent of the total required obligations under the conservation agreement for the next three years and fifty five percent thereafter 
these percentages take into consideration current and anticipated cash funding levels of the company to the tmv llc and the centennial founders  llc and the anticipated funding levels of our joint venture partners

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial or commodity market prices or rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates and commodity prices 
financial market risks our exposure to financial market risks includes changes to interest rates and credit risks related to marketable securities  interest rates related to our outstanding indebtedness and trade receivables 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields and prudently managing risk 
to achieve this objective and limit interest rate exposure  we limit our investments to securities with a maturity of less than five years and an investment grade rating from moody s or standard and poor s

the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its line of credit  which as of december  had an outstanding balance of  and as of february  had an outstanding balance of  and the long term debt currently outstanding 
the line of credit interest rate can be tied to the lending bank s prime rate and would change when that rate changes  or the debt can be tied to a libor rate on a fixed basis and change only at maturity of the fixed rate feature 
the long term debt  as of december  has a fixed interest rate and the fair value of 
table of contents this long term debt will change based on interest rate movements in the market 
the floating rate feature in our line of credit can expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
we believe it is prudent at times to limit the variability of floating rate interest payments and in the past have entered into interest rate swaps to manage those fluctuations 
at december   we had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
however  ta petro  an unconsolidated joint venture  has an interest rate swap agreement with respect to  of its long term debt to manage interest rate risk by converting floating interest rate debt to fixed rate debt 
this swap agreement matures in august and is a contract to exchange variable rate for fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement

market risk related to our inventories ultimately depends on the value of the almonds  winegrapes  and pistachios  at the time of payment or sale 
credit risk related to our receivables depends upon the financial condition of our customers 
based on historical experience with current customers and periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions  we believe our credit risk is minimal 
market risk is discussed below in commodity price exposure

table of contents interest rate sensitivity financial market risks principal amount by expected maturity at december  in thousands thereafter total fair value assets marketable securities weighted average interest rate liabilities short term debt weighted average interest rate long term debt weighted average interest rate in comparison to the prior years  our risk with regard to fluctuations in interest rates has increased related to the use of debt because of the outstanding balance on our line of credit 
our risk with regard to fluctuations in interest rates has decreased slightly related to marketable securities since these balances have decreased compared to the prior year 
commodity price exposure we have exposure to adverse price fluctuations associated with certain inventories and accounts receivable 
inventories consist of farming and processing costs related to almond production and crop production 
the farming costs inventoried are recorded as actual costs incurred 
historically  these costs have been recovered each year when that year s crop harvest has been sold 
with respect to accounts receivable  the amount at risk relates primarily to farm crops 
these receivables are often recorded as estimates of the prices that ultimately will be received for the crops 
the final price is generally not known for several months following the close of our fiscal year 
of the accounts receivable outstanding at december    is at risk to changing prices 
of that amount   is attributable to almonds and  is attributable to pistachios 
the comparable amounts of accounts receivable at december  were  related to almonds and  related to pistachios 
the price estimated for recording accounts receivable at december  was per pound for almonds 
for every change in the price of almonds  our receivable for almonds changes by  although the final price of almonds and therefore the extent of the risk is not presently known  over the last three years prices have ranged from to 
with respect to pistachios  the price estimated for recording the receivable was per pound  so for each change in the price of pistachios  our receivable changes by  and the range of final prices over the last three years for pistachios has been to
