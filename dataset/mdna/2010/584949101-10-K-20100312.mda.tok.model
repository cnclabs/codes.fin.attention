item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions set forth in the cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements  which can be found in item a  risk factors 
our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth in the risk factors section and elsewhere in this report 
executive overview we are a leading provider of technology enabled clinical documentation services 
we offer health systems  hospitals  and group medical practices integrated solutions for voice capture  speech recognition  medical transcription  document management and clinical documentation improvement using natural language processing  as well as coding services 
our solutions are designed to facilitate electronic access to clinical information by healthcare providers and to improve overall revenue cycle performance and adoption of the electronic health record ehr 
we perform our services utilizing the docqment tm enterprise platform dep  our proprietary clinical documentation workflow management system 
we believe our services and enterprise technology solutions including mobile voice capture devices  speech recognition technologies  web based workflow platforms  and global network of medical transcriptionists mts and medical editors mes enable to improve patient care  increase physician satisfaction and lower operational costs while facilitating their migration toward increased adoption and utilization of the ehr 

table of contents significant developments in the clinical documentation industry include a shortage of qualified domestic mts and mes has increased the demand for offshore medical transcription services by healthcare providers 
this demand for qualified mts and mes  combined with budgetary pressures experienced by healthcare providers nationwide  has also caused many more healthcare providers to evaluate and consider the use of offshore medical transcription services 
several low cost providers have emerged and aggressively moved into our market offering medical transcription services performed both domestically and offshore at prices significantly below our traditional price point 
while we believe the market for outsourced medical transcription continues to expand  the growing acceptance of utilizing offshore labor by healthcare providers has further increased the competitive environment in the medical transcription industry 
technological advances including speech recognition products reduce the length of time required to transcribe medical reports  in turn reducing the overall cost of medical transcription services 
one of our competitors  spheris inc filed for bankruptcy protection and we have offered to purchase the domestic assets of spheris  inc see subsequent events in this section 
growing market penetration of ehr and certain other technologies have eliminated or shortened the length of certain worktypes produced through transcription 
although we remain the leading provider of medical transcription services in the us  we experience competition from many other providers at the local  regional and national level 
the medical transcription industry remains highly fragmented  with hundreds of small companies in the us performing medical transcription services 
we believe the outsourced portion of the medical transcription services market will increase due in part to the majority of healthcare providers seeking the following reductions in overhead and other administrative costs  improvements in the quality and delivery speed of transcribed medical reports  access to leading technologies  such as speech recognition technology  without development and investment risk  implementation and management of a medical transcription system tailored to the providers specific requirements  access to skilled mts and mes  solutions for compliance with governmental and industry mandated privacy and security requirements  and product offerings that interface with ehr initiatives 
we evaluate our operating results based upon the following factors revenues  operating income  net income per share  adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  net cash provided by operating activities  and days sales outstanding 
our goal is to execute our strategy to yield growth in net revenues  operating income  cash flow and net income per share 

table of contents network and information systems  the internet and other technologies are critical to our business activities 
substantially all of our transcription services are dependent upon the use of network and information systems  including the use of our dep and our license to use speech recognition secured from a third party 
if information systems including the internet or our dep are disrupted  we could face a significant disruption of services provided to our customers 
we have periodically experienced short term outages with our dep  which have not significantly disrupted our business and we have an active disaster recovery program in place for our information systems and our dep 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates management s discussion and analysis md a is based in part upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap 
we believe there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenues and other significant areas that involve management s judgments and estimates 
these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with our audit committee 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at such time  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other independent sources 
actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates 
a critical accounting estimate must meet two criteria it requires assumptions about highly uncertain matters  and there would be a material effect on the financial statements from either using a different  although reasonable  amount within the range of the estimate in the current period or from reasonably likely period to period changes in the estimate 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements as addressed in note to our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant and critical include valuation of long lived and other intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions  we allocate portions of the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets  consisting primarily of acquired technologies  and customer relationships  based on independent appraisals received after each acquisition  with the remainder allocated to goodwill 
we assess the realizability of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we have determined that the reporting unit level is our sole operating segment 
we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangibles  for impairment when events indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when we determine that one or more impairment indicators are present for an asset  we compare the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate  we then compare the fair value to the book value of the asset 
if the fair value is less than the book value  we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
some of the events that we consider as impairment indicators for our long lived assets  including goodwill  are our net book value compared to our fair value  significant adverse economic and industry trends  significant decrease in the market value of the asset  the extent that we use an asset or changes in the manner that we use it  significant changes to the asset since we acquired it  and other changes in circumstances that potentially indicate all or a portion of the company will be sold 

table of contents deferred income taxes 
deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits that we expect to be able to apply against future taxable income or that will result in future net operating losses that we can carry forward to use against future taxable earnings 
our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be utilized  we record a valuation allowance against that asset 
in making that determination we consider all positive and negative evidence and give stronger consideration to evidence that is objective in nature 
commitments and contingencies 
we routinely evaluate claims and other potential litigation to determine if a liability should be recorded in the event it is probable that we will incur a loss and can estimate the amount of such loss 
revenue recognition 
we recognize medical transcription services revenues when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  services have been rendered and collectability is reasonably assured 
these services are recorded using contracted rates and are net of estimates for customer credits 
historically  our estimates have been adequate 
if actual results are higher or lower than our estimates  we would have to adjust our estimates and financial statements in future periods 
we recognize the remainder of our revenues from the sale and implementation of voice capture and document management products including software and implementation  training and maintenance services related to these products 
the application of the accounting guidelines requires judgment regarding the timing of the recognition of these revenues including i whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements  ii whether customizations or modifications of the software are significant  and iii whether collection of the software fee is probable 
additionally  for certain contracts we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method 
percentage of completion accounting involves estimates of the total costs to be incurred over the duration of the project 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the carrying value of accounts receivable approximates fair value 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of potential losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments due 
this allowance is used to state trade receivables at estimated net realizable value 
we estimate uncollectible amounts based upon our historical write off experience  current customer receivable balances  aging of customer receivable balances  the customer s financial condition and current economic conditions 
historically  our estimates have been adequate to provide for our accounts receivable exposure 
additionally  we enter into medical transcription service contracts that may contain provisions for performance penalties in the event we do not meet certain required service levels  primarily related to turnaround time on transcribed reports 
we reduce revenues for any such performance penalties and service level credits incurred and have included an estimate of such penalties and credits in our allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we recognize product revenues for sales to end user customers and resellers upon passage of title if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
end user customers generally do not have a right of return 
we provide certain of our resellers and distributors with limited rights of return of our products 
we reduce revenues for rights to return our product based upon our historical experience and have included an estimate of such credits in our allowance for uncollectible accounts 
customer accommodation program 
in response to customers concerns regarding historical billing matters  we established a plan to offer financial accommodations to certain of our customers during and and recorded the related liability 
in we reached an agreement on customer litigation resolving all claims by the named parties 
since then we have not made additional offers 
we are unable to predict how many customers  if any  may accept the outstanding accommodation offers on the terms proposed by us  nor are we able to predict the timing of the acceptance or rejection of any outstanding accommodation offers 
until any offers are accepted  we may withdraw or modify the terms of the accommodation program or any outstanding offers at any time 
in addition  we are unable to predict how many future offers  if made  will be accepted on the terms proposed by us 
we regularly evaluate whether to proceed with  modify or withdraw the accommodation program or any outstanding offers 

table of contents basis of presentation sources of revenues we derive revenues primarily from providing medical transcription services to health systems  hospitals and large group medical practices 
our customers are generally charged a rate times the volume of work that we transcribe or edit 
in the clinical documentation workflow  we provide  in addition to medical transcription technology and services  maintenance services  digital dictation  speech recognition and electronic signature services

the revenue decline was primarily due to lower prices for our transcription service related revenues of million  net of revenues realized from higher year over year transcription volume  declining product and companion maintenance revenues totaling million largely related to customers not renewing maintenance contracts for legacy systems 
pricing for our transcription services remains under pressure as many customers seek us to reduce their costs by using more offshore labor and increasing productivity with expanded use of speech recognition 
cost of revenues cost of revenues declined by million  or  to million for the year ended december  when compared to the prior year amount of million 
the decline was attributable to the following staffing reductions that reduced costs by million resulting from restructuring actions taken by management to align our operating costs to better compete in a lower price environment for our services  a million reduction in medical transcription costs related to our increased use of speech recognition technology  and our increased use of offshore labor to supplement our domestic workforce capacity  lower product costs of million as a result of lower product and maintenance related sales and services  other reductions of million  net  and a million reversal of an accrual due to the lapsing of the statute of limitations 

table of contents selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  this decrease was the result of company wide cost reduction initiatives that included a million decrease in compensation costs due to reductions in workforce and a million decrease in legal and other professional fees

after consideration of all evidence  both positive and negative  management concluded again in  that it was more likely than not that a significant portion of the domestic deferred income tax assets would not be realized 
in addition  various adjustments were recorded for the year ended december  including the reduction of the foreign valuation allowance and various adjustments related to state tax exposures 
subsequent events on february   we and our majority shareholder  cbay inc cbay and  together with us  the purchasers  entered into a stalking horse stock and asset purchase agreement the apa with spheris  inc and certain of its affiliates collectively  the sellers  under which we have agreed to purchase substantially all of the domestic business of spheris inc  and cbay has agreed to purchase all of the outstanding shares of spheris india private limited together  the assets  subject to the terms and conditions therein 
each of the sellers is a debtor in a chapter case before the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the bankruptcy court

we believe the reduction in volume was the result primarily of customer losses to other outsourced medical transcription providers due to  among other things  price competition or  in the area of radiology  replacement of our transcription services with speech recognition technology offerings of our competitors  and reduced sales of our technology products of million due primarily to reduced maintenance contracts 
cost of revenues cost of revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable primarily to headcount reductions associated with restructuring actions taken to better align our overhead costs with our lower revenue levels  and increased use of offshore labor to supplement our domestic capacity  reduced our costs by million  reduced medical transcription revenues resulted in a reduction of million of payroll costs  and reduced product and maintenance revenue resulted in lower technology costs of million 
as a percentage of net revenues  cost of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in  as a result largely of actions taken to reduce fixed costs at a faster pace than the reduction of our net revenues

table of contents in connection with acquisitions  we allocate portions of the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets  consisting primarily of acquired technologies  and customer relationships  agreements based on independent appraisals received after each acquisition  with the remainder allocated to goodwill 
we assess the realizability of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we have determined that the reporting unit level is our sole operating segment 
we tested goodwill for impairment during the first three quarters of and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value based upon the capitalization 
in the fourth quarter  which included our annual impairment testing date in december  we determined our fair value using a combination of our market capitalization based on market price per share for approximately the days before december   and a discounted cash flow analysis 
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment  including judgment about appropriate discount rates  perpetual growth rates  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  as well as relevant comparable company earnings multiples for the market based approach 
the cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analyses are based on our internal business model for and  for years beyond  the growth rates we used are an estimate of the future growth in the industry in which we participate 
the discount rates used in the discounted cash flow analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the reporting unit and are based on an estimated cost of capital  which we determined based on our estimated cost of capital relative to our capital structure 
in addition  the market based approach utilizes comparable company public trading values  research analyst estimates and  where available  values observed in private market transactions 
our analysis indicated that the reporting unit fair value was below our book value 
the test for impairment of goodwill is a two step process first  we compare the carrying amount of our reporting unit  which is the book value of our entire company  to the fair value of our reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we have to perform the second step of the process 
if not  no further testing is needed 
in the fourth quarter of we determined that the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeded the fair value and accordingly performed the second step in the analysis 
if the second part of the analysis is required  we allocate the fair value of our reporting unit to all assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test 
we then compare the implied fair value of our reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess 
in the fourth quarter of  the carrying value of goodwill exceeded its implied fair value and accordingly we recorded a non cash  pre tax impairment charge of million 
we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangibles  for impairment when events indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when we determine that one or more impairment indicators are present for an asset  we compare the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate  we compare the fair value to the book value of the asset 
if the fair value is less than the book value  we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
some of the events that we consider as impairment indicators for our long lived assets  including goodwill  are our net book value compared to our fair value  significant adverse economic and industry trends  significant decrease in the market value of the asset  the extent that we use an asset or changes in the manner that we use it  significant changes to the asset since we acquired it  and other changes in circumstances that potentially indicate all or a portion of the company will be sold 
during we reviewed the carrying value of our long lived assets other than goodwill and determined that the carrying amounts of such assets was less than the undiscounted cash flows and accordingly no impairment charge was recorded 

table of contents restructuring charges for the year ended december   we recorded a restructuring charge of million for severance obligations 
for the year ended december   we recorded a restructuring charge of million comprised of million for severance obligations and million for non cancelable leases related to the closure of offices 
interest income  net interest income  net reflects interest earned on cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest income  net decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to lower interest rates earned in the period compared with the period  and a decrease in the average cash balance in of million 
income tax provision the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was an income tax benefit rate of compared with an effective income tax provision rate of for the year ended december  the tax benefit includes the reversal of approximately million of deferred tax liabilities associated with indefinite life intangible assets related to goodwill which was impaired in after consideration of all evidence  both positive and negative  management concluded again in  that it was more likely than not that a significant portion of the domestic deferred income tax assets would not be realized 
in addition  various adjustments were recorded for the year ended december  including the reduction of the foreign valuation allowance and various adjustments related to state tax exposures 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million compared with million as of december  our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations  available cash on hand and our credit facility

in august we entered into a five year million revolving credit agreement credit agreement with wells fargo foothill  llc 
subject to certain terms and conditions  the credit agreement provides committed revolving funding through august and includes an option whereby we can increase its maximum credit to million 
the amount available for borrowings is based upon a percentage of eligible accounts receivable 
there are reserves established which limit the amounts that can be available 
at december   million was available under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement is a working capital facility that may be used for general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement enables us to borrow funds in us dollars  at variable interest rates 
the credit agreement provides the lender a security interest in and against significantly all of our assets 
under the credit agreement we agreed to certain covenants customarily found in such agreements including  but not limited to  financial covenants requiring us to maintain certain minimum levels of ebitda and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
at december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the credit agreement 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with cash expected to be generated from operations and cash available under the credit agreement will be sufficient to finance our operations for the foreseeable future

rules and interpretive releases of the sec under federal securities 
table of contents laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all guidance contained in the codification carries an equal level of authority 
in september  the fasb ratified two consensuses affecting revenue recognition the first consensus  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  sets forth requirements that must be met for an entity to recognize revenue from the sale of a delivered item that is part of a multiple element arrangement when other items have not yet been delivered 
one of those current requirements is that there be objective and reliable evidence of the standalone selling price of the undelivered items  which must be supported by either vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe 
this consensus eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements have vsoe or tpe before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
the overall arrangement fee will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity s estimated selling price 
application of the residual method of allocating an overall arrangement fee between delivered and undelivered elements will no longer be permitted 
the second consensus  software revenue recognition addresses the accounting for transaction involving software to exclude from its scope tangible products that contain both software and non software and not software components that function together to deliver a products functionality 
the consensuses are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we are evaluating the potential impact of these requirements on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk we earn interest income from our balances of cash and cash equivalents 
this interest income is subject to market risk related to changes in interest rates  which affects primarily our investment portfolio 
we invest in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
management estimates that if the average yield of our investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately million to million 
the impact on our future interest income will depend largely on the gross amount of our investments and future changes in investment yields 
there are no material changes in our exposure to interest rate risk as compared to our exposure to interest rate risk for the year ended december
