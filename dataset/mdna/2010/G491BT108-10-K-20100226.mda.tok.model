the three levels are defined as follows level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
an asset or liability s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
there are three types of valuation approaches a market approach  which uses observable prices and other relevant information that is generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities  an income approach  which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single  discounted present value amount  and a cost approach  which is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset 
the following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value  as well as the general classification of such assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy 
cash equivalents cash equivalents include cash investments in money market funds and time deposits

available for sale investments available for sale investments include amounts seeded into affiliated investment products  foreign time deposits and investments in affiliated collateralized loan obligations clos 
seed money is valued under the market approach through the use of quoted market prices available in an active market and is classified within level of the valuation hierarchy

these investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets  there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments 
foreign time deposits are valued under the income approach based on observable interest rates and are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy 
clos are valued using an income approach 
table of contents through the use of certain observable and unobservable inputs 
due to current liquidity constraints within the market for clo products that require the use of unobservable inputs  these investments are classified as level within the valuation hierarchy 
an increase or decrease in the discount rate of would change the discounted cash flows of the clos by million million 
trading investments trading investments primarily include the investments of the deferred compensation plans that are offered to certain invesco employees 
these investments are primarily invested in affiliated funds that are held to economically hedge current and non current deferred compensation liabilities 
trading securities are valued under the market approach through the use of quoted prices in an active market and are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy

as a result  the blended average statutory tax rate will vary from year to year depending on the mix of the profits and losses of the company s subsidiaries 
the majority of our profits are earned in the us  canada and the uk the current uk statutory tax rate is  the canadian statutory tax rate is and the us federal statutory tax rate is 
on december   legislation was enacted to reduce the canadian income tax rate over five years  which changed the rate to in and in the legislation was revised in december  further reducing the rate to in  in  and in the reduction in our canadian deferred tax assets as a result of these rate changes increased our effective tax rate by and is included in other above 
at december   the company had tax loss carryforwards accumulated in certain taxing jurisdictions in the aggregate of million million  approximately million of which expire between and  with the remaining million having an indefinite life 
a full valuation allowance has been recorded against the deferred tax assets related to these losses based on a history of losses in these taxing jurisdictions which make it unlikely that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as a result of a uk legislative change  effective july   we anticipate that future dividends paid to the uk from non uk subsidiaries will meet one of the new classes of exemption and thus will not be subject to further uk tax 
since we anticipate that future dividends will be exempt we will no longer be able to utilize our excess underlying foreign tax credits of million in million which had been recorded as a deferred tax asset with a full valuation allowance

the company and its subsidiaries file annual income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  various us state and local jurisdictions  and in numerous foreign jurisdictions 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position  for which the company has unrecognized tax benefits  is finally resolved 
to the extent that the company has favorable tax settlements  or determines that accrued amounts are no longer needed due to a lapse in the applicable statute of limitations or other change in circumstances  such liabilities  as well as the related interest and penalty  would be reversed as a reduction of income tax expense net of federal tax effects  if applicable in the period such determination is made

the company and its subsidiaries are periodically examined by various taxing authorities 
with few exceptions  the company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by the primary tax authorities for years prior to management monitors changes in tax statutes and regulations and the issuance of judicial decisions to determine the potential impact to uncertain income tax positions

consolidated investment products the company provides investment management services to  and has transactions with  various private equity  real estate  fund of funds  clos and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business 
the company serves as the investment manager  making day to day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products 
certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities vies 
if the company is the primary beneficiary of the vies  then the investment products are consolidated into the company s financial statements 
other partnership entities are consolidated under a voting interest entity voe model where the company is the general partner and is presumed to have control  in the absence of simple majority kick out rights to remove the general partner  simple majority liquidation rights to dissolve the partnership  or any substantive participating rights of the other limited partners 

table of contents for investment products that are structured as partnerships and are determined to be vies  including private equity  real estate and fund of funds products  the company evaluates the structure of the partnership to determine if it is the primary beneficiary of the investment product 
this evaluation includes assessing the rights of the limited partners to transfer their economic interests in the investment product 
if the limited partners lack objective rights to transfer their economic interests  they are considered to be de facto agents of the company  resulting in the company determining that it is the primary beneficiary of the investment product 
the company generally takes less than a investment in these entities as the general partner 
interests in unconsolidated private equity  real estate and fund of funds products are classified as equity method investments in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company s risk with respect to each investment is limited to its equity ownership and any uncollected management fees 
therefore  gains or losses of consolidated investment products have not had a significant impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
the company has no right to the benefits from  nor does it bear the risks associated with  these investments  beyond the company s minimal direct investments in  and management fees generated from  the investment products 
if the company were to liquidate  these investments would not be available to the general creditors of the company  and as a result  the company does not consider investments held by consolidated investment products to be company assets 
for clo entities  as discussed in note  fair value of assets and liabilities  the company generally takes only a relatively small portion of the unrated  junior subordinated positions 
the company s investments in clos are generally subordinated to other interests in the entities and entitle the investors to receive the residual cash flows  if any  from the entities 
investors in clos have no recourse against the company for any losses sustained in the clo structure 
the company s ownership interests  which are classified as available for sale investments on the company s consolidated balance sheets  combined with its other interests management and incentive fees  are quantitatively assessed to determine if the company is the primary beneficiary of these entities 
the company determined that it did not absorb the majority of the expected gains or losses from the clos and therefore is not their primary beneficiary 
the company s equity interest in the clos of million at december  december  million  represents its maximum risk of loss 
as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  the company has entered into contingent support agreements for two of its investment trusts to enable them to sustain a stable pricing structure  creating variable interests in these vies 
the company earns management fees from the trusts and has a small investment in one of these trusts 
the company was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these trusts after considering any explicit and implicit variable interests in relation to the total expected gains and losses of the trusts 
the maximum committed amount under the support agreements  which represents the company s maximum risk of loss  is equivalent to the amount of support that the trusts required as of december   to maintain the net asset value of the trusts at per share 
the recorded fair value of the guarantees related to these agreements at december   was estimated to be million december  million  which was recorded as a guarantee obligation in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of these agreements is lower than the maximum support amount reflecting management s estimation that the likelihood of funding under the support agreement is low  as significant investor redemptions out of the trusts before the scheduled maturity of the underlying securities or significant credit default issues of the securities held within the trusts portfolios would be required to trigger funding by the company 
in june  the company invested in the initial public offering of invesco mortgage capital inc nyse ivr  a real estate investment trust which is managed by the company 
the company purchased  common shares of ivr at per share and  limited partner units at per unit through private placements for a total of million 
the company determined that ivr is a vie and that its investment represents a variable interest 
the company s ownership interests  which are classified as equity method investments on the company s consolidated balance sheets  combined with its other interests management fees  were quantitatively assessed to determine if the company is the primary beneficiary of ivr 
the company determined that it did not absorb the majority of the expected gains or losses from ivr and therefore is not its primary beneficiary 
on july   the us treasury announced the launch of the public private investment program ppip  which was designed to support market functioning and facilitate price discovery in the asset based securities markets  to allow banks and other financial institutions to re deploy capital  and to extend new credit to households and businesses 
under this program  the us treasury will invest up to billion of equity and debt into funds established with private sector investment managers and private investors for the purpose of purchasing legacy securities 
the us treasury has partnered with eight investment management firms  including invesco  in the ppip 
the company determined that certain feeder funds within the invesco sponsored ppip partnership structure are vies  however  the company is not their primary beneficiary  as it does not absorb the majority of the expected gains or losses from these funds 
additionally  the company does not have any capital invested or committed into these funds 
other funds within the ppip structure are voes  however  the company as general partner is not deemed to control these entities due to the presence of substantive kick out or liquidation rights

consolidated investment products are generally structured as partnerships 
generally  the investment strategy of underlying holdings in these partnerships is to seek capital appreciation through direct investments in public or private companies with compelling business models or ideas or through investments in partnership investments that also invest in similar private or public companies 
various strategies may be used 
companies targeted could be distressed organizations  targets of leveraged buyouts or fledgling companies in need of venture capital 
investees of these consolidated investment products may not redeem their investment until the partnership liquidates 
generally  the partnerships have a life that range from seven to twelve years unless dissolved earlier 
the general partner may extend the partnership term up to a specified period of time as stated in the partnership agreement 
some partnerships allow the limited partners to cause an earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain events as specified in the partnership agreement 
for private equity partnerships  fair value is determined by reviewing each investment for the sale of additional securities of an issuer to sophisticated investors or for investee financial conditions and fundamentals 
publicly traded portfolio investments are carried at market value as determined by their most recent quoted sale  or if there is no recent sale  at their most recent bid price 
for these investments held by consolidated investment products  level classification indicates that fair values have been determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the partnership has the ability to access 
level classification may indicate that fair values have been determined using quoted prices in active markets but give effect to certain lock up restrictions surrounding the holding period of the underlying investments 
the fair value of level investments held by consolidated investment products are derived from inputs that are unobservable and which reflect the limited partnerships own determinations about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the investments  including assumptions about risk 
these inputs are developed based on the partnership s own data  which is adjusted if information indicates that market participants would use different assumptions 
the partnerships which invest directly into private equity portfolio companies direct private equity funds take into account various market conditions  subsequent rounds of financing  liquidity  financial condition  purchase multiples paid in other comparable third party transactions  the price of securities of other companies comparable to the portfolio company  and operating results and other financial data of the portfolio company  as applicable 
the partnerships which invest into other private equity funds funds of funds take into account information received from those underlying funds  including their reported net asset values and evidence as to their fair value approach  including consistency of their fair value application 
these investments do not trade in active markets and represent illiquid long term investments that generally require future capital commitments 
while the partnerships reported share of the underlying net asset values of the underlying funds is usually the most significant input in arriving at fair value and is generally representative of fair value  other information may also be used to value such investments at a premium or discount to the net asset values as reported by the funds  including allocations of priority returns within the funds as well as any specific conditions and events affecting the funds 
unforeseen events might occur that would subsequently change the fair values of these investments  but such changes would be inconsequential to the company due to its minimal investments in these products and the large offsetting noncontrolling interests resulting from their consolidation 
any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in these investments are substantially offset by resulting changes in gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and therefore do not have a

share awards share awards are broadly classified into two categories time vested and performance vested 
share awards are measured at fair value at the date of grant and are expensed  based on the company s estimate of shares that will eventually vest  on a straight line or accelerated basis over the vesting period 
time vested awards vest ratably over or cliff vest at the end of a period of continued employee service 
performance vested awards cliff vest at the end of or vest ratably over a defined vesting period of continued employee service upon the company s attainment of certain performance criteria  generally the attainment of cumulative earnings per share growth targets at the end of the vesting period reflecting a compound annual growth rate of between and per annum during a three year period 
time vested and performance vested share awards are granted in the form of restricted share awards rsas or restricted share units rsus 
dividends accrue directly to the employee holder of rsas  and cash payments in lieu of dividends are made to employee holders of certain rsus 
there is therefore no discount to the fair value of these share awards at their grant date
