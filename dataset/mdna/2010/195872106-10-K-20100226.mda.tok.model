operating strategy our general business objective as a multifamily focused reit is to generate stable and increasing cash flow and portfolio value for our shareholders through a strategy of 
table of contents realizing growth in income from our existing portfolio of properties  selectively acquiring and developing multifamily properties to grow our core portfolio and improve the age and quality of our multifamily apartment communities in growth markets located in the sunbelt region of the united states  employing a comprehensive capital maintenance program to maintain properties in first class condition  including recycling capital by selectively disposing of assets and reinvesting the proceeds into opportunities with more perceived growth potential  managing our own properties  including our assets through joint venture arrangements  which enables us to better control our operating expenses and establish and maintain long term relationships with our commercial tenants  maintaining our third party property management business  which increases cash flow through management fee income stream and establishes additional relationships with investors and tenants  and executing our plan to dispose of our for sale residential assets and land held for future sale 
financing strategy we seek to maintain a well balanced  conservative and flexible capital structure by pursuing long term debt financings and refinancings on a secured or unsecured basis subject to market conditions  borrowing primarily at fixed rates  extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt  and targeting appropriate debt service and fixed charge coverage 
we believe that these strategies have enabled  and should continue to enable  us to access the debt and equity capital markets to fund debt refinancings and the acquisition and development of additional properties consistent with our business objectives 
as further discussed under liquidity and capital resources in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k  we expect that our availability under our existing unsecured credit facility  minimal debt maturities in  the number of unencumbered properties in our multifamily portfolio and the additional financing through secured agency financing obtained in and anticipated in will provide sufficient liquidity to execute our business plan 
this liquidity  along with our projected asset sales is expected to allow us to execute our plan in the short term

risk factors in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  set forth below are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us  whether oral or written 
we wish to ensure that any forward looking statements are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements in order to maximize to the fullest extent possible the protections of the safe harbor established in the private securities litigation reform act of accordingly  any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to  and are accompanied by  the following important factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from our forward looking statements 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected  and the trading price of the trust s common shares could decline 
these forward looking statements are based on management s present expectations and beliefs about future events 
as with any projection or forecast  these statements are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances 
there may be additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial that also may impair our business operations 
you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties 
risks associated with real estate recession in the united states and the related downturn in the housing and real estate markets have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the united states economy is believed to have entered a recession sometime during the trends in both the real estate industry and the broader united states economy continue to be unfavorable and continue to adversely affect our revenues 
the downturn in the us economy and related reduction in spending  falling home prices and high unemployment  together with the price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the financial and credit markets could  among other things  impede the ability of our residents at our multifamily properties and our tenants at our commercial properties and other parties with which we conduct business to perform their contractual obligations  which could lead to an increase in defaults by our residents  tenants and other contracting parties  which could adversely affect our revenues 
furthermore  our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates  or at all  is adversely affected by the increase in supply and deterioration in the multifamily market stemming from ongoing recession and is dependent upon the overall level of spending in the economy  which is adversely affected by  among other things  job losses and unemployment levels  recession  personal debt levels  the downturn in the housing market  stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future 
with regard to our ability to lease our multifamily properties  the increasing rental of excess for sale condominiums  which increases the supply of multifamily units and housing alternatives  may further reduce our ability to lease our multifamily units and further depress rental rates in certain markets 
with regard to for sale residential properties  the market for our for sale residential properties depends on an active demand for new for sale housing and high consumer confidence 
continuing decline in demand  exacerbated by tighter credit standards for home buyers and foreclosures  has further contributed to an oversupply of housing alternatives adversely affecting the timing of sales and price at which we are able to sell our for sale residential properties and thereby adversely affecting our profits from for sale residential properties 
we cannot predict how long demand and other factors in the real estate market will remain unfavorable  but if the markets remain weak or deteriorate further  our ability to lease our properties  our ability to increase or maintain rental rates in certain markets and the pace of condominium sales and closings and or the related sales prices may continue to weaken during we face numerous risks associated with the real estate industry that could adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs 
as a real estate company  we are subject to various changes in real estate conditions  particularly in the sunbelt region where our properties are concentrated  and any negative trends in such real estate conditions may adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs 
these conditions include worsening of national and regional economic conditions  such as those we are currently experiencing as a result of the ongoing recession as described above  as well as the deteriorating local economic conditions in our principal market areas  availability of financing  the inability of residents and tenants to pay rent  the existence and quality of the competition  such as the attractiveness of our property as compared to our competitors properties based on considerations such as convenience of location  rental rates  amenities and safety record  increased operating costs  including increased real property taxes  maintenance  insurance and utilities costs  weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather related expenses  
table of contents oversupply of multifamily  commercial space or single family housing or a reduction in demand for real estate in the markets in which our properties are located  a favorable interest rate environment that may result in a significant number of potential residents of our multifamily apartment communities deciding to purchase homes instead of renting  rent control or stabilization laws  or other laws regulating rental housing  which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs  and changing trends in the demand by consumers for merchandise offered by retailers conducting business at our retail properties 
moreover  other factors may affect our results of operations adversely  including changes in government regulations and other laws  rules and regulations governing real estate  zoning or taxes  changes in interest rate levels  the availability of financing and potential liability under environmental and other laws and other unforeseen events  most of which are discussed elsewhere in the following risk factors 
any or all of these factors could materially adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs 
increased competition and increased affordability of residential homes could limit our ability to retain our residents  lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 
our multifamily apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents  including other multifamily apartment communities and single family rental homes  as well as owner occupied single and multi family homes 
competitive housing in a particular area and an increase in the affordability of owner occupied single and multi family homes due to  among other things  declining housing prices  mortgage interest rates and tax incentives and government programs to promote home ownership  could adversely affect our ability to retain residents  lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 
we are subject to significant regulations  which could adversely affect our results of operations through increased costs and or an inability to pursue business opportunities 
local zoning and use laws  environmental statutes and other governmental requirements may restrict our development  expansion  rehabilitation and reconstruction activities 
these regulations may prevent or delay us from taking advantage of economic opportunities 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines  awards to private litigants of damages against us  substantial litigation costs and substantial costs of remediation or compliance 
in addition  we cannot predict what requirements may be enacted in the future or that such a requirement will not increase our costs of regulatory compliance or prohibit us from pursuing business opportunities that could be profitable to us 
real estate investments are illiquid  and therefore  we may not be able to sell our properties in response to economic changes which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid generally  and may become even more illiquid during periods of economic downturn 
as a result  we may not be able to sell a property or properties quickly or on favorable terms in response to changes in the economy or other conditions when it otherwise may be prudent to do so 
this inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our properties could adversely affect our results of operations if we cannot sell an unprofitable property 
in the case of our for sale residential properties  our inability to sell units in a timely manner could adversely affect our financial condition  among other things  by causing us to hold properties for a longer period than is otherwise desirable and requiring us to record impairment charges in connection with the properties see note impairment to our notes to consolidated financial statements of the trust and crlp included in this annual report on form k 
our financial condition could also be adversely affected if we were  for example  unable to sell one or more of our properties in order to meet our debt obligations upon maturity 
in addition  the tax laws applicable to reits require that we hold our properties for investment  rather than primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business  which may cause us to forego or defer sales of properties that otherwise would be in our best interest 
therefore  we may be unable to vary our portfolio promptly in response to market conditions  which may adversely affect our financial position 
compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act and fair housing act could result in substantial costs 
under the americans with disabilities act of  or ada  and the fair housing amendment act of  or fhaa  and various state and local laws  all public accommodations and commercial facilities must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
compliance with these requirements could involve removal of structural barriers from certain disabled persons entrances 
other federal  state and local laws may require modifications to or restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to such means of access 
noncompliance with the ada  fhaa or related laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines by government authorities  awards to private litigants of 
table of contents damages against us  substantial litigation costs and the incurrence of additional costs associated with bringing the properties into compliance 
risks associated with our operations our revenues are significantly influenced by demand for multifamily properties generally  and a decrease in such demand will likely have a greater adverse effect on our revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio 
our portfolio is focused predominately on multifamily properties 
as a result  we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry 
a decrease in the demand for multifamily properties would likely have a greater adverse effect on our rental revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio 
resident demand at multifamily properties has been and could continue to be adversely affected by the downturn in the us economy and the related reduction in spending  reduced home prices and high unemployment  together with the price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions the in financial and credit markets  as well as the rate of household formation or population growth in our markets  changes in interest rates or changes in supply of  or demand for  similar or competing multifamily properties in an area 
to the extent that any of these conditions occur and continue to occur  they are likely to affect occupancy and market rents at multifamily properties  which could cause a decrease in our rental revenue 
any such decrease could impair our ability to satisfy our substantial debt service obligations or make distributions to our shareholders 
our ability to dispose of our existing inventory of condominium and for sale residential assets could adversely affect our results of operations 
to help implement our plans to strengthen the balance sheet and deleverage the company  in january  the trust s board of trustees decided to accelerate plans to dispose of our for sale residential assets including condominium conversions and land held for future for sale residential and mixed use developments until we determine that the current economic environment has sufficiently improved 
as of december   we have for sale residential units remaining and residential lots for sale 
exiting these markets may expose us to the following risks local real estate market conditions  such as oversupply or reduction in demand  may result in reduced or fluctuating sales  for sale properties acquired for development usually generate little or no cash flow until completion of development and sale of a significant number of homes or condominium units and may experience operating deficits after the date of completion and until such homes or condominium units are sold  we may abandon development or conversion opportunities that we have already begun to explore  and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring any such opportunities  we may be unable to close on sales of individual units under contract  buyers may be unable to qualify for financing  sales prices may be lower than anticipated  competition from other condominiums and other types of residential housing may result in reduced or fluctuating sales  we could be subject to liability claims from condominium associations or others asserting that construction performed was defective  resulting in litigation and or settlement discussions  and we may be unable to attract sales prices with respect to our for sale assets that compensate us for our costs which may result in impairment charges 
after reevaluating our operating strategy in light of the ongoing downturn in the us economy and credit crisis  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of largely attributable to our condominium and for sale residential assets 
in addition  during  we recorded million of non cash impairment charges related to certain for sale residential units  a commercial development and certain land parcels 
see item  impairment  of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding this impairment charge 
if market conditions do not improve or if there is further market deterioration  it may impact the number of projects we can sell  the timing of the sales and or the prices at which we can sell them 
if we are unable to sell projects  we may incur additional impairment charges on projects previously impaired as well as on projects not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may exist  which would decrease the value of our assets as reflected on our balance sheet and adversely affect our shareholders equity 
there can be no assurances of the amount or pace of future for sale residential sales and closings  particularly given current market conditions 

table of contents our properties may not generate sufficient rental income to pay our expenses if we are unable to lease our new properties or renew leases or re lease space at our existing properties as leases expire  which may adversely affect our operating results 
we derive the majority of our income from residents and tenants who lease space from us at our properties 
a number of factors may adversely affect our ability to attract residents and tenants at favorable rental rates and generate sufficient income  including local conditions such as an oversupply of  or reduction in demand for  multifamily or commercial properties  the attractiveness of our properties to residents  shoppers and tenants  decreases in market rental rates  and our ability to collect rent from our residents and tenants 
if we cannot generate sufficient income to pay our expenses  maintain our properties and service our debt as a result of any of these factors  our operating results may be adversely affected 
furthermore  the ongoing deterioration of the us economy and the related reduction in spending  falling home prices and high unemployment  together with the price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the financial and credit markets could  among other things  impede the ability of our residents or tenants to perform their contractual obligations  which could lead to an increase in defaults by residents and tenants 
the residents at our multifamily properties generally enter into leases with an initial term ranging from six months to one year 
tenants at our office properties generally enter into leases with an initial term ranging from three to ten years and tenants at our retail properties generally enter into leases with an initial term ranging from one to ten years 
as leases expire at our existing properties  residents and tenants may elect not to renew them 
even if our residents and tenants do renew or if we can re lease the space  the terms of renewal or re leasing  including the cost of required renovations may be less favorable than current lease terms 
in addition  for new properties  we may be unable to attract enough residents and tenants and the occupancy rates and rents may not be sufficient to make the property profitable 
if we are unable to renew the leases or re lease the space at our existing properties promptly and or lease the space at our new properties  or if the rental rates upon renewal or re leasing at existing properties are significantly lower than expected rates  or if there is an increase in tenant defaults  our operating results will be negatively affected 
we may not be able to control our operating costs or our expenses may remain constant or increase  even if our revenues decrease  causing our results of operations to be adversely affected 
factors that may adversely affect our ability to control operating costs include the need to pay for insurance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes  which could increase over time  the need periodically to repair  renovate and re lease space  the cost of compliance with governmental regulation  including zoning and tax laws  the potential for liability under applicable laws  interest rate levels  and the availability of financing 
if our operating costs increase as a result of any of the foregoing factors  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
the expense of owning and operating a property is not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 
as a result  if revenues drop  we may not be able to reduce our expenses accordingly 
costs associated with real estate investments  such as real estate taxes  loan payments and maintenance generally will not be reduced even if a property is not fully occupied or other circumstances cause our revenues to decrease 
if a property is mortgaged and we are unable to meet the mortgage payments  the lender could foreclose on the mortgage and take the property  resulting in a further reduction in net income 
we are subject to increased exposure to economic and other factors due to the concentration of our properties in the sunbelt region  and economic downturns  natural disasters or acts of terrorism in the sunbelt region could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
substantially all of our properties are located in the sunbelt region of the united states 
in particular  we derived approximately of our net operating income in from top quartile cities located in the sunbelt region 
we are therefore subject to increased exposure to economic and other factors specific to these geographic areas 
if the sunbelt region of the united states  and in particular the areas of or near birmingham  al  atlanta  ga  orlando  fl  charlotte  nc and dallas fort worth  tx  experiences a recession or other slowdown in the economy  a natural disaster or an act of terrorism  our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected as a result of decreased revenues  increased costs or damage or loss of assets 

table of contents tenant bankruptcies and downturns in tenants businesses may adversely affect our operating results by decreasing our revenues 
at any time  a tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition 
additionally  the ongoing deterioration in the us economy and related reduction in spending  reduced home prices and high unemployment  together with the price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the financial and credit markets could  among other things  adversely affect our tenants financially and impede their ability to perform their contractual obligations 
as a result  our tenants may delay lease commencement  cease or defer making rental payments or declare bankruptcy 
a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants would bar all efforts by us to collect pre bankruptcy debts from that tenant  or their property  unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court 
a tenant bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases  and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums 
if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy  all pre bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full 
however  if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy  we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages 
any unsecured claim we hold may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims  and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected 
as a result  it is likely that we will recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold from a bankrupt tenant 
the bankruptcy or financial difficulties of any of our tenants may negatively affect our operating results by decreasing our revenues 
risks associated with the property management  leasing and brokerage businesses could adversely affect our results of operations by decreasing our revenues 
in addition to the risks we face as a result of our ownership of real estate  we face risks relating to the property management  leasing and brokerage businesses of cpsi  including risks that management contracts or service agreements with third party owners will be terminated and lost to competitors  contracts will not be renewed upon expiration or will not be available for renewal on terms consistent with current terms  and leasing and brokerage activity generally may decline 
each of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations by decreasing our revenues 
we could incur significant costs related to environmental issues which could adversely affect our results of operations through increased compliance costs or our financial condition if we become subject to a significant liability 
under federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  a current or previous owner or operator of real property  and parties that generate or transport hazardous substances that are disposed of on real property  may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating hazardous substances on or under or released from the property and for damages to natural resources 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation liability act  and similar state laws  generally impose liability on a joint and several basis  regardless of whether the owner  operator or other responsible party knew of or was at fault for the release or presence of hazardous substances 
in connection with the ownership or operation of our properties  we could be liable in the future for costs associated with investigation and remediation of hazardous substances released at or from such properties 
the costs of any required remediation and related liability as to any property could be substantial under these laws and could exceed the value of the property and or our assets 
the presence of hazardous substances or the failure to properly remediate those substances may result in our being liable for damages suffered by a third party for personal injury  property damage  cleanup costs  or otherwise and may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent a property or to borrow funds using the property as collateral 
in addition  environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which we use our properties or operate our business  and these restrictions may require expenditures for compliance 
the restrictions themselves may change from time to time  and these changes may result in additional expenditures in order to achieve compliance 
we cannot assure you that a material environmental claim or compliance obligation will not arise in the future 
the costs of defending against any claims of liability  of remediating a contaminated property  or of complying with future environmental requirements could be substantial and affect our operating results 
in addition  if a judgment is obtained against us or we otherwise become subject to a significant environmental liability  our financial condition may be adversely affected 
during  we engaged in the expansion of our wal mart center at colonial promenade winter haven in orlando  florida 
we received notice that the property that was purchased for the expansion contained environmental contamination that required remediation 
we agreed to pay million towards the remediation  which was paid during the expansion was completed in  but we are still awaiting a no further action letter from the relevant regulatory agency 
in  we disposed of colonial promenade winter haven  but remain equally responsible with wal mart for obtaining a no further action letter on the wal mart parcel 
in addition  we are obligated  using reasonable commercial efforts  to obtain a no further action letter for the two adjoining parcels on either side of the wal mart parcel 

table of contents costs associated with addressing indoor air quality issues  moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be costly 
as a general matter  concern about indoor exposure to mold or other air contaminants has been increasing as such exposure has been alleged to have a variety of adverse effects on health 
as a result  there have been a number of lawsuits in our industry against owners and managers of apartment communities relating to indoor air quality  moisture infiltration and resulting mold 
the terms of our property and general liability policies generally exclude certain mold related claims 
should an uninsured loss arise against us  we would be required to use our funds to resolve the issue  including litigation costs 
we make no assurance that liabilities resulting from indoor air quality  moisture infiltration and the presence of or exposure to mold will not have a future impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as the owner or operator of real property  we could become subject to liability for asbestos containing building materials in the buildings on our properties 
some of our properties may contain asbestos containing materials 
environmental laws typically require that owners or operators of buildings with asbestos containing building materials properly manage and maintain these materials  adequately inform or train those who may come in contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions  including removal or other abatement  in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition 
these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements 
in addition  third parties may be entitled to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos containing building materials 
uninsured or underinsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition 
as of december   we are self insured up to million  million and million for general liability  workers compensation and property insurance  respectively 
we are also self insured for health insurance and responsible for amounts up to  per claim and up to million per person  according to plan policy limits 
if the actual costs incurred to cover such uninsured claims are significantly greater than our budgeted costs  our financial condition will be adversely affected 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance in amounts that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties and appropriate given the relative risk of loss and the cost of the coverage 
there are  however  certain types of losses  such as lease and other contract claims  acts of war or terrorism  acts of god  and in some cases  earthquakes  hurricanes and flooding that generally are not insured because such coverage is not available or it is not available at commercially reasonable rates 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in the damaged property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property 
the costs associated with property and casualty renewals may be higher than anticipated 
we cannot predict at this time if in the future we will be able to obtain full coverage at a reasonable cost 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations  and other factors also might make it impractical or undesirable to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 
in addition  if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness  we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness  even if these properties were irreparably damaged 
we may be unable to develop new properties or redevelop existing properties successfully  which could adversely affect our results of operations due to unexpected costs  delays and other contingencies 
our operating strategy historically has included development of new properties  as well as expansion and or redevelopment of existing properties 
even though we decided in january to postpone future development activities including previously identified future development projects until we determine that the current economic environment has sufficiently improved  we have completed all but one of our developments that were in process during and expect to reengage in the development of our colonial promenade nord du lac development during development activity may be conducted through wholly owned affiliates or through joint ventures 
however  there are significant risks associated with such development activities in addition to those generally associated with the ownership and operation of developed properties 
these risks include the following we may be unable to obtain  or face delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased development costs and or lower than expected leases  local real estate market conditions  such as oversupply or reduction in demand  may result in reduced or fluctuating rental rates  
table of contents we may incur development costs for a property that exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other costs  changes in development plans or unforeseen environmental conditions  which could make completion of the property more costly or uneconomical  land  insurance and construction costs continue to increase in our markets and may continue to increase in the future and we may be unable to attract rents that compensate for these increases in costs  we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore  and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring any such opportunities  rental rates and occupancy levels may be lower than anticipated  changes in applicable zoning and land use laws may require us to abandon projects prior to their completion  resulting in the loss of development costs incurred up to the time of abandonment  and we may experience late completion because of construction delays  delays in the receipt of zoning  occupancy and other approvals or other factors outside of our control 
in addition  if a project is delayed  certain residents and tenants may have the right to terminate their leases 
furthermore  from time to time we may utilize tax exempt bond financing through the issuance of community development and special assessment district bonds to fund development costs 
under the terms of such bond financings  we may be responsible for paying assessments on the underlying property to meet debt service obligations on the bonds until the underlying property is sold 
accordingly  if we are unable to complete or sell a development property subject to such bond financing and we are forced to hold the property longer than we originally projected  we may be obligated to continue to pay assessments to meet debt service obligations under the bonds 
if we are unable to pay the assessments  a default will occur under the bonds and the property could be foreclosed upon 
any one or more of these risks may cause us to incur unexpected development costs  which would negatively affect our results of operations 
our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision making authority  our reliance on our joint venture partners financial condition  any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners 
as of december   we had million of equity invested in joint ventures 
see note investment in partially owned entities and other arrangements in our notes to consolidated financial statements of the trust and crlp contained in item of this form k 
our investments in these joint ventures involve risks not customarily associated with our wholly owned properties  including the following we share decision making authority with some of our joint venture partners regarding major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and the joint venture properties  such as the acquisition of properties  the sale of the properties or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the properties  which may prevent us from taking actions that are opposed by those joint venture partners  prior consent of our joint venture partners is required for a sale or transfer to a third party of our interests in the joint venture  which restricts our ability to dispose of our interest in the joint venture  our joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions  which may delay construction or development of a joint venture property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture  our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to the joint venture properties that conflict with our business interests and goals  which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership  management or disposition of such properties  disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the joint venture properties or the joint venture  which may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and distract our officers and or trustees from focusing their time and effort on our business  and possibly disrupt the day to day operations of the property such as by delaying the implementation of important decisions until the conflict or dispute is resolved see  for example  the discussion under note commitments  contingencies  guarantees and other arrangements to our notes to consolidated financial statements of the trust and crlp included in item of this form k  our joint venture partners may be unsuccessful in refinancing or replacing existing mortgage indebtedness  or may choose not to do so  which could adversely affect the value of our joint venture interest  we may suffer losses as a result of the actions of our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments  and our joint venture partner may elect to sell or transfer its interests in the joint venture to a third party  which may result in our loss of management and leasing responsibilities and fees that we currently receive from the joint venture properties 

table of contents during  certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures exercised options to extend an aggregate of approximately million of outstanding mortgage debt from to in addition  one of our unconsolidated joint ventures disposed of its only property  a unit multifamily apartment community  a portion of the proceeds of which were used to repay an outstanding collateralized million mortgage loan on the property of which our pro rata share was million 
we intend to cooperate with our joint venture partners in connection with their efforts to refinance and or replace any outstanding joint venture indebtedness which may also include  for example  property dispositions  which cooperation may include additional capital contributions from time to time 
there can be no assurance that our joint ventures will be successful in refinancing and or replacing such existing debt at maturity or otherwise 
the failure to refinance and or restructure such debt could materially adversely affect the value of our joint venture interests and therefore the value of our joint venture investments  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are required to perform under various financial guarantees that we have provided with respect to certain of our joint ventures and retail developments 
from time to time  we guarantee portions of the indebtedness of certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations guarantees and other arrangements of this annual report on form k  for a description of the guarantees that we have provided with respect to the indebtedness of certain of our joint ventures as of december  from time to time  in connection with certain retail developments  we receive funding from municipalities for infrastructure costs through the issuance of bonds that are repaid primarily from sales tax revenues generated from the tenants at each respective development 
in some instances  we guarantee the shortfall  if any  of tax revenues to the debt service requirements on these bonds 
if we are required to fund any amounts related to any of these guarantees  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
in addition  we may not be able to ultimately recover funded amounts 
competition for acquisitions could reduce the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and result in increased prices for properties  which could adversely affect our return on properties we purchase 
we compete with other major real estate investors with significant capital for attractive investment opportunities in multifamily and commercial properties 
these competitors include publicly traded reits  private reits  domestic and foreign financial institutions  life insurance companies  pension trusts  trust funds  investment banking firms  private institutional investment funds and national  regional and local real estate investors 
this competition could increase the demand for multifamily properties  and therefore reduce the number of suitable acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the prices paid for such acquisition properties 
as a result  our expected return from investment in these properties would deteriorate 
acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability 
we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse  or with only limited recourse  against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities that were not discovered during due diligence 
as a result  if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties  we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it  which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include liabilities for clean up of undisclosed environmental contamination  claims by tenants  vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business  and claims for indemnification by general partners  directors  officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties 
we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from our acquisitions  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we will acquire multifamily properties only if they meet our criteria and we believe that they will enhance our future financial performance and the value of our portfolio 
our belief  however  is based on and is subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors  many of which are forward looking and are uncertain in nature or are beyond our control 
in addition  some of these properties may have unknown characteristics or deficiencies or may not complement our portfolio of existing properties 
as a result  some properties may be worth less or may generate less revenue than  or simply not perform as well as  we believed at the time of the acquisition  thereby negatively affecting our operating results 

table of contents failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth 
we may from time to time commence development activities or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if economic conditions warrant and appropriate opportunities arise 
our historical experience in our existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets 
we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets 
these risks include  among others an inability to evaluate accurately local apartment or for sale residential housing market conditions and local economies  an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities  an inability to hire and retain key personnel  and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 
risks associated with our indebtedness and financing activities we have substantial indebtedness and our cash flow may not be sufficient to make required payments on our indebtedness or repay our indebtedness as it matures 
we rely on debt financing for our business 
as of december   the amount of our total debt was approximately billion  consisting of billion of consolidated debt and billion of our pro rata share of joint venture debt 
in addition  as of december   a significant amount of our indebtedness was secured by our real estate assets 
due to our high level of debt  we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our funds from operations to servicing our debt and our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest 
if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the mortgagee could foreclose upon that property  appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies 
in addition  if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as new equity capital  our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt 
most of our indebtedness does not require significant principal payments prior to maturity 
however  we will need to raise additional equity capital  obtain collateralized or unsecured debt financing  issue private or public debt  or sell some of our assets to either refinance or repay our indebtedness as it matures 
we cannot assure you that these sources of financing or refinancing will be available to us at reasonable terms or at all 
our inability to obtain financing or refinancing to repay our maturing indebtedness  and our inability to refinance existing indebtedness on reasonable terms  may require us to make higher interest and principal payments  issue additional equity securities  or sell some of our assets on disadvantageous terms  all or any of which may result in foreclosure of properties  partial or complete loss on our investment and otherwise adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operation

our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing and have other adverse effects which would negatively impact our results of operation and financial condition 
as of december   our consolidated borrowings and pro rata share of unconsolidated borrowings totaled approximately billion of consolidated borrowings and billion of unconsolidated borrowings 
our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the incurrence of debt 
our leverage and any future increases in our leverage could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  make us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns  reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development or other general corporate purposes which would negatively impact our results of operation and financial condition 
due to the amount of our variable rate debt  rising interest rates would adversely affect our results of operation 
as of december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt outstanding  consisting of million of our consolidated debt and million of our pro rata share of variable rate unconsolidated joint venture debt 
while we have sought to refinance our variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or cap our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using interest rate swap agreements where appropriate  failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 
furthermore  interest rate swap agreements and other hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks  including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations 
developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of 
table of contents operations or financial condition 
in addition  as opportunities arise  we may borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future 
as a result  a significant increase in interest rates would adversely affect our results of operations 
we have entered into debt agreements with covenants that restrict our operating activities  which could adversely affect our results of operations  and violation of these restrictive covenants could adversely affect our financial condition through debt defaults or acceleration 
our unsecured credit facility contains numerous customary restrictions  requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt  including the following financial ratios collateralized debt to total asset value ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio  total liabilities to total asset value ratio  total permitted investments to total asset value ratio  and unencumbered leverage ratio 
the indenture under which our senior unsecured debt is issued also contains financial and operating covenants including coverage ratios 
our indenture also limits our ability to incur collateralized and unsecured indebtedness  sell all or substantially all or our assets  and engage in mergers  consolidations and acquisitions 
also  certain of our mortgage indebtedness contains customary covenants which  among other things  limit our ability  without the prior consent of the lender  to further mortgage the property  to enter into new leases or materially modify existing leases  and to discontinue insurance coverage 
these restrictions  as well as any additional restrictions which we may become subject to in connection with additional financings or refinancings  will continue to hinder our operational flexibility through limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pursue certain business initiatives or make other changes to our business 
these limitations could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  violations of these covenants could cause the declaration of defaults and any related acceleration of indebtedness  which would result in adverse consequences to our financial condition 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial and operating covenants under our existing credit facility and indenture  and we believe that we will continue to remain in compliance with these covenants 
however  given the deterioration in the us economy and continued uncertainty in the credit markets  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with these ratios and other debt covenants in the future  particularly if conditions were to worsen 
our inability to obtain sufficient third party financing could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition because we depend on third party financing for our capital needs  including development  expansion  acquisition and other activities 
to qualify as a reit  we must distribute to our shareholders each year at least of our reit taxable income  excluding any net capital gain 
because of these distribution requirements  it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs from income from operations 
as a result  when we engage in the development or acquisition of new properties or expansion or redevelopment of existing properties  we will continue to rely on third party sources of capital  including lines of credit  collateralized or unsecured debt both construction financing and permanent debt  and equity issuances 
these sources  however  may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
our access to third party sources of capital depends on a number of factors  including the market s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings 
moreover  additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of our shareholders interests  and additional debt financing may substantially increase our leverage 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund our current or new development or project expansions or our acquisition activities on terms favorable to us or at all 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient level of third party financing to fund our capital needs  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain sufficient third party financing for our capital needs  including development  expansion  acquisition and other activities  on reasonable terms or at all and could have other adverse effects on us and the market price of the trust s common shares 
during  the united states credit markets experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions  which have caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets  making terms for certain financings less attractive  and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing  even for companies who are otherwise qualified to obtain financing 
continued uncertainty in the 
table of contents credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for our capital needs  including development  expansion  acquisition activities and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all  which may negatively affect our business 
additionally  due to this uncertainty  we may be unable to refinance or extend our existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness 
if we are not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due  we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms  which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain permanent financing on development projects we financed with construction loans or mezzanine debt 
our inability to obtain such permanent financing on favorable terms  if at all  could cause us to incur additional capital costs in connection with completing such projects  of which could have an adverse affect on our business 
a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to further adjust our business plan accordingly 
these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of the trust s common shares  preferred shares or subordinated notes 
the disruptions in the financial markets have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the market value of the trust s common shares and other adverse effects on us and our business 
our senior notes do not have an established trading market  therefore  holders of our notes may not be able to sell their notes 
each series of crlp s senior notes is a new issue of securities with no established trading market 
we do not intend to apply for listing of any series of notes on any national securities exchange 
the underwriters in an offering of senior notes may advise us that they intend to make a market in the notes  but they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice 
we can give no assurance as to the liquidity of or any trading market for any series of our notes 
a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during  moody s investors service lowered the credit rating on our senior unsecured debt to ba from baa additionally  standard poor s lowered the credit rating on our senior unsecured debt to bb from bbb and the rating on our preferred shares to b from bb 
while the downgrades by both moody s investors service and standard poor s do not affect our ability to draw proceeds under our unsecured line of credit  the pricing on the credit facility has adjusted from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points 
the downgrade had the effect of increasing our borrowing costs  and further downgrades  while not impacting our borrowing costs  could shorten borrowing periods  thereby adversely impacting our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and otherwise limiting our access to capital  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with our organization and structure some of our trustees and officers have conflicts of interest and could exercise influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of our shareholders 
as a result of their substantial ownership of common shares and units  messrs 
thomas lowder  our chairman and chief executive officer  james lowder and harold ripps  each of whom is a trustee  could seek to exert influence over our decisions as to sales or re financings of particular properties we own 
any such exercise of influence could produce decisions that are not in the best interest of all of the holders of interests in us 
the lowder family and their affiliates hold interests in a company that has performed insurance brokerage services with respect to our properties 
this company may perform similar services for us in the future 
as a result  the lowder family may realize benefits from transactions between this company and us that are not realized by other holders of interests in us 
in addition  given their positions with us  thomas lowder  as our chairman and chief executive officer  and james lowder  as a trustee  may be in a position to influence us to do business with companies in which the lowder family has a financial interest 
other than a specific procedure for reviewing and approving related party construction activities  we have not adopted a formal policy for the review and approval of conflict of interest transactions generally 
pursuant to our charter  our audit committee reviews and discusses with management and our independent registered public accounting firm any such transaction if deemed material and relevant to an understanding of our financial statements 
our policies and practices may not be successful in eliminating the influence of conflicts 
moreover  transactions with companies controlled by the lowder family  if any  may not be on terms as favorable to us as we could obtain in an arms length transaction with a third party 

table of contents restrictions on the acquisition and change in control of the company may have adverse effects on the value of the trust s common shares and crlp s partnership units 
various provisions of the trust s declaration of trust restrict the possibility for acquisition or change in control of us  even if the acquisition or change in control were in the shareholders interest 
as a result  the value of the trust s common shares and crlp s partnership units may be less than they would otherwise be in the absence of such restrictions 
the trust s declaration of trust contains ownership limits and restrictions on transferability 
the trust s declaration of trust contains certain restrictions on the number of common shares and preferred shares that individual shareholders may own  which is intended to ensure that we maintain our qualification as a reit 
in order for us to qualify as a reit  no more than of the value of our outstanding shares may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities during the last half of a taxable year and the shares must be beneficially owned by or more persons during at least days of a taxable year of months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year 
to help avoid violating these requirements  the trust s declaration of trust contains provisions restricting the ownership and transfer of shares in certain circumstances 
these ownership limitations provide that no person may beneficially own  or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code  more than  in either number of shares or value whichever is more restrictive  of any class of our outstanding shares  in number or value whichever is more restrictive  of our outstanding common shares and any outstanding excess shares  and in the case of certain excluded holders related to the lowder family by one individual  by two individuals  by three individuals  or by four individuals 
these ownership limitations may be waived by the trust s board of trustees if it receives representations and undertakings of certain facts for the protection of our reit status  and if requested  an irs ruling or opinion of counsel 
the trust s declaration of trust permits the trust s board of trustees to issue preferred shares with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
the trust s declaration of trust permits the board of trustees of the trust to issue up to  preferred shares  having those preferences  conversion or other rights  voting powers  restrictions  limitations as to distributions  qualifications  or terms or conditions of redemption as determined by the board of trustees 
thus  the board of trustees of the trust could authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which some or a majority of shareholders might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price of shares 
the trust s declaration of trust and bylaws contain other possible anti takeover provisions 
the trust s declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing an acquisition or change in control of the company  and  as a result could prevent our shareholders from being paid a premium for their common shares over the then prevailing market prices 
these provisions include a prohibition on shareholder action by written consent  the ability to remove trustees only at a meeting of shareholders called for that purpose  by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two thirds of the shares then outstanding and entitled to vote in the election of trustees  the limitation that a special meeting of shareholders can be called only by the president or chairman of the board or upon the written request of shareholders holding outstanding shares representing at least of all votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting  the advance written notice requirement for shareholders to nominate a trustee or submit other business before a meeting of shareholders  and the requirement that the amendment of certain provisions of the declaration of trust relating to the removal of trustees  the termination of the company and any provision that would have the effect of amending these provisions  require the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of the shares then outstanding 
we may change our business policies in the future  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
our major policies  including our policies with respect to development  acquisitions  financing  growth  operations  debt capitalization and distributions  are determined by the trust s board of trustees 
a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations  including our ability to service debt 
for example  in january  we decided to accelerate our plan to dispose of our for sale residential assets and land held for future for sale residential and mixed use developments and postpone future development activities including previously identified future development projects until we determine that the current economic environment has sufficiently improved 
as a result of this decision  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million  million of abandoned pursuit costs and million of restructuring charges related to a reduction in our development staff and other overhead personnel 
in 
table of contents  we recorded non cash impairment charges of million  million of abandoned pursuit costs and million of restructuring charges related to a reduction in our development staff and other overhead personnel 
the trust s board of trustees may amend or revise these and other policies from time to time in the future  and no assurance can be given that additional amendments or revisions to these or other policies will not result in additional charges or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to the trust s shares market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of the trust s common shares 
the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares  as a percentage of the price of the shares  relative to market interest rates 
if market interest rates increase  prospective purchasers of the trust s shares may expect a higher annual distribution rate 
higher interest rates would not  however  result in more funds for us to distribute and  in fact  would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution 
this could cause the market price of the trust s common shares to go down 
in addition  although the trust s common shares are listed on the new york stock exchange  the daily trading volume of the trust s shares may be lower than the trading volume for other industries 
as a result  our investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares 
a large number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of the trust s common shares and may be dilutive to current shareholders 
the sales of a substantial number of common shares  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the trust s common shares 
in addition to issuances of shares pursuant to share option and share purchase plans  as of december   we may issue up to  common shares of the trust upon redemption of currently outstanding units of crlp 
in addition  the trust has filed a registration statement with the sec allowing us to offer  from time to time  equity securities of the trust including common or preferred shares for an aggregate initial public offering price of up to million on an as needed basis and subject to our ability to affect offerings on satisfactory terms based on prevailing conditions 
as of december   the trust had issued  of its common shares  at a weighted average issue price of per share  under a continuous equity issuance program and  of its common shares  at an aggregate public offering price of  in an underwritten public offering 
the continuous equity issuance program was terminated by the trust in october following the completion of the underwritten public offering 
pursuant to the crlp partnership agreement  each time the trust issues common shares crlp issues to the trust an equal number of units for the same price at which the common shares were sold 
accordingly  crlp issued  common units to the trust  at a weighted average issue price of per share  in connection with the continuous equity issuance program and  common units to the trust  at per unit  with respect to the common shares issued by the trust in the underwritten equity offering 
additionally  the trust s board of trustees can authorize the issuance of additional securities without shareholder approval 
our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing  including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt  and equity financing  including issuances of common and preferred equity 
no prediction can be made about the effect that future distribution or sales of common shares of the trust will have on the market price of the trust s common shares 
we may change our dividend policy 
the trust intends to continue to declare quarterly distributions on its common shares 
future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of the trust s board of trustees and the amount and timing of distributions will depend upon cash generated by operating activities  our financial condition  capital requirements  annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code  and such other factors as the trust s board of trustees deem relevant 
the trust s board of trustees reviews the dividend quarterly and there can be no assurance as to the manner in which future dividends will be paid or that the current dividend level will be maintained in future periods 
changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market s expectations with regard to our earnings and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of the trust s common shares 
we believe that the market value of a reit s equity securities is based primarily upon the market s perception of the reit s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions  and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets 
for that reason  our shares may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share 
to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes  working capital reserves or other purposes  these retained funds  while increasing the value of our underlying assets  may not correspondingly increase the market price of the trust s common shares 
in addition  we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet the required payments on our preferred shares and the operating partnership s preferred units 
our failure to meet the 
table of contents market s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our shares 
the stock markets  including the new york stock exchange nyse  on which the trust lists its common shares  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
as a result  the market price of the trust s common shares could be similarly volatile  and investors in the trust s common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following our financial condition and operating performance and the performance of other similar companies  actual or anticipated differences in our quarterly operating results  changes in our revenues or earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  publication of research reports about us or our industry by securities analysts  additions and departures of key personnel  strategic decisions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions  divestments  spin offs  joint ventures  strategic investments or changes in business strategy  the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours  the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities including securities issued by other real estate companies  an increase in market interest rates  which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares  the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry  speculation in the press or investment community  actions by institutional shareholders or hedge funds  changes in accounting principles  terrorist acts  and general market conditions  including factors unrelated to our performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
risks associated with income tax laws the trust s failure to qualify as a reit would decrease the funds available for distribution to its shareholders and adversely affect the market price of the trust s common shares 
we believe that the trust has qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended december  the trust intends to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit  but it cannot assure shareholders that the trust will qualify as a reit 
the trust has not requested and does not plan to request a ruling from the irs that the trust qualifies as a reit  and the statements in this form k are not binding on the irs or any court 
as a reit  the trust generally will not be subject to federal income tax on its income that it distributes currently to its shareholders 
many of the reit requirements are highly technical and complex 
the determination that the trust is a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances that may not be totally within its control 
for example  to qualify as a reit  at least of our gross income must come from sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws 
the trust generally is prohibited from owning more than of the voting securities or more than of the value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer  subject to certain exceptions  including an exception with respect to certain debt instruments and corporations electing to be taxable reit subsidiaries 
the trust is also required to distribute to its shareholders at least of its reit taxable income excluding capital gains 
the fact that the trust holds most of its assets through the crlp further complicates the application of the reit requirements 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize the trust s reit status 
furthermore  congress or the internal revenue service might make changes to the tax laws and regulations  or the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult  or impossible  for the trust to remain qualified as a reit 
if the trust fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  and is unable to avail itself of certain savings provisions set forth in the internal revenue code irs  the trust would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
as a taxable corporation  the trust would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing its taxable income or pass through long term capital gains to individual shareholders at favorable rates 
the trust also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes 
the trust would not be able to elect to be taxed as a reit for four years following the year it first failed to qualify unless the irs were to grant it relief under certain statutory provisions 
if the trust failed to qualify as a reit  it would have to pay significant income taxes  which would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to its shareholders 
this likely would have a 
table of contents significant adverse effect on the trust s earnings and the value of the trust s common shares and crlp s partnership units 
in addition  the trust would no longer be required to pay any distributions to shareholders 
if the trust fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and is able to avail itself of one or more of the statutory savings provisions in order to maintain our reit status  the trust would nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of at least  or more for each such failure 
moreover  the trust s failure to qualify as a reit also would cause an event of default under its credit facility and may adversely affect the trust s ability to raise capital and to service its debt 
even if the trust qualifies as a reit  it will be required to pay some taxes particularly related to the trust s taxable reit subsidiary 
even if the trust qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the trust will be required to pay certain federal  state and local taxes on its income and property 
for example  the trust will be subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than of its reit taxable income including capital gains 
moreover  if the trust has net income from prohibited transactions  that income will be subject to a tax 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale 
however  the trust will not be treated as a dealer in real property with respect to a property that it sells for the purposes of the tax if i the trust has held the property for at least two years for the production of rental income prior to the sale  ii capitalized expenditures on the property in the two years preceding the sale are less than of the net selling price of the property  and iii the trust either a has seven or fewer sales of property excluding certain property obtained through foreclosure for the year of sale or b the aggregate tax basis of property sold during the year of sale is or less of the aggregate tax basis of all of the trust s assets as of the beginning of the taxable year or c the fair market value of the property sold during the year of sale is or less of the aggregate fair market value of all of the trust s assets as of the beginning of the taxable year and in the case of b or c  substantially all of the marketing and development expenditures with respect to the property sold are made through an independent contractor from whom the trust derives no income 
the sale of more than one property to one buyer as part of one transaction constitutes one sale for purposes of this safe harbor 
the trust intends to hold its properties  and crlp intends to hold its properties  for investment with a view to long term appreciation  to engage in the business of acquiring  developing  owning and operating properties  and to make occasional sales of properties as are consistent with our investment objectives 
however  not all of the trust s sales will satisfy the safe harbor requirements described above 
furthermore  there are certain interpretive issues related to the application of the safe harbor that are not free from doubt under the federal income tax law 
while we acquire and hold our properties with an investment objective and do not believe they constitute dealer property  we cannot provide any assurance that the irs might not contend that one or more of these sales are subject to the penalty tax or that the irs would not challenge our interpretation of  or any reliance on  the safe harbor provisions 
in addition  any net taxable income earned directly by the trust s taxable reit subsidiaries  or through entities that are disregarded for federal income tax purposes as entities separate from the trust s taxable reit subsidiaries  will be subject to federal and possibly state corporate income tax 
the trust has elected to treat cpsi as a taxable reit subsidiary  and it may elect to treat other subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries in the future 
in this regard  several provisions of the laws applicable to reits and their subsidiaries ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation 
for example  a taxable reit subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to an affiliated reit 
in addition  the reit has to pay a penalty tax on some payments that it receives or on some deductions taken by the taxable reit subsidiaries if the economic arrangements between the reit  the reit s tenants  and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties 
finally  some state and local jurisdictions may tax some of the trust s income even though as a reit it is not subject to federal income tax on that income because not all states and localities treat reits the same as they are treated for federal income tax purposes 
to the extent that the trust and its affiliates are required to pay federal  state and local taxes  the trust will have less cash available for distributions to the trust s shareholders 
reit distribution requirements may increase our indebtedness 
the trust may be required from time to time  under certain circumstances  to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received 
in such event  or upon the trust s repayment of principal on debt  it could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit 
accordingly  we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 
tax elections regarding distributions may impact our future liquidity 
under certain circumstances  the trust may make a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year 
this election may allow the trust to avoid increasing its dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year 
however  this could result in a constraint on the trust s ability to decrease its dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability 

table of contents we may in the future choose to pay dividends in our own common shares  in which case shareholders may be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends they receive 
we may in the future distribute taxable dividends that are payable partly in cash and partly in our common shares 
under existing irs guidance with respect to taxable years ending on or before december   up to of such a dividend could be payable in our common shares 
taxable shareholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes  regardless of whether such shareholder receives cash  reit shares or a combination of cash and reit shares 
as a result  a shareholder may be required to pay income tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received 
if a shareholder sells the reit shares it receives in order to pay this tax  the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend  if the market value of our shares decreases following the distribution 
furthermore  with respect to certain non us stockholders  we may be required to withhold non us federal income tax with respect to dividends paid in our common shares 
in addition  if a significant number of our shareholders determine to sell shares of our common shares in order to pay taxes owed on dividends  it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common shares

undeveloped land we currently own various parcels of land that are held for future developments 
land adjacent to multifamily properties typically would be considered for potential development of another phase of an existing multifamily property if we determine that the particular market can absorb additional apartment units

funds from operations ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  means income loss before noncontrolling interest determined in accordance with gaap  excluding sales of depreciated property  plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented to assist investors in analyzing our performance 
we believe that ffo is useful to investors because it provides an additional indicator of our financial and operating performance 
this is because  by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation and gains or losses from sales of properties all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparison of operating performance among equity reits 
ffo is a widely recognized measure in the company s industry 
we believe that the line on its consolidated statements of operations entitled net income available to common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
management believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has been fundamentally beneficial  improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
in addition to company management evaluating the operating performance of its reportable segments based on ffo results  management uses ffo and ffo per share  along with other measures  to assess performance in connection with evaluating and granting incentive compensation to key employees 
our method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
ffo should not be considered a as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap  b as an indicator of financial performance  c as cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap or d as a measure of liquidity nor is it indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs  including our ability to make distributions

the trust is the direct general partner of  and as of december   held approximately of the interests in  crlp 
we conduct all of our business through crlp  cpslp  which provides management services for our properties  and cpsi  which provides management services for properties owned by third parties  including unconsolidated joint venture entities 
we perform the majority of our for sale residential and condominium conversion activities through cpsi 
as a lessor  the majority of our revenue is derived from residents and tenants under existing leases at our properties 
therefore  our operating cash flow is dependent upon the rents that we are able to charge to our residents and tenants  and the ability of these residents and tenants to make their rental payments 
we also receive third party management fees generated from third party management agreements related to management of properties held in joint ventures 
business strategy and outlook since mid  we have experienced a global financial and economic crisis  which included  among other things  significant reductions and disruptions in available capital and liquidity from banks and other providers of credit  substantial reductions and or volatility in equity values worldwide and concerns that the weakening us and worldwide economies could enter into a prolonged recessionary period 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive  and in some cases  resulted in the unavailability of financing even for companies who were otherwise qualified to obtain financing 
in addition  the weakening economy and mounting job losses in the us  and the slowdown in the overall us housing market  resulting in increased supply  led to deterioration in the multifamily market 
the turmoil in the credit and capital markets  high unemployment  the increased housing supply and our expectation that the economy would continue to remain weak caused us to recalibrate our business plan at the beginning of as a result of the economic decline  our focus for was on our outlined priorities of strengthening the balance sheet  improving liquidity  addressing our near term debt maturities  managing our existing properties and operating our portfolio efficiently  including reducing our overhead and postponing or phasing future development activities 
we made significant progress in implementing this business strategy during as outlined below 

table of contents strengthening the balance sheet despite a challenging transaction environment  we sold assets  including consolidated and unconsolidated assets  for aggregate proceeds of approximately million during the year ended december   including the following significant transactions colonial promenade fultondale  a retail asset that we developed  for million including million of seller financing  recognizing a gain of million  net of income taxes  colonial promenade winter haven  a retail asset  for million  recognizing a gain of million  units at five of our for sale residential communities for million  which included the remaining units at three of the communities  and the remaining units at our condominium conversion projects for million  which included the sale of portofino at jensen beach and murano at delray beach 
during  the trust issued  common shares under its million continuous equity offering program  at a weighted average issue price of per share  raising net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting commissions and other offering expenses payable by the company 
the proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
upon commencement of the public underwritten equity offering noted below  we terminated this program 
pursuant to the crlp partnership agreement  each time the trust issues common shares crlp issues to the company an equal number of units for the same price at which the common shares were sold 
accordingly  during  crlp issued  common units to the trust  at a weighted average issue price of per share  in connection with the continuous equity issuance program 
in october  the trust completed an equity offering of  common shares  including shares issued to cover over allotments  at per share 
total net proceeds from this offering were approximately million  after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses payable by the company 
these proceeds were used to pay down a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the company s unsecured credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
in accordance with the crlp partnership agreement  crlp issued  common units to the trust  at per unit  for the common shares issued by the trust in the equity offering 
in addition to the equity offerings discussed above  we also repurchased an aggregate of million of outstanding unsecured senior notes of crlp as more fully discussed under addressing near term maturities 
improving liquidity as the economic uncertainty continues  ensuring adequate liquidity remains critical 
during the year ended december   we closed on a year  million collateralized facility  with a weighted average fixed interest rate of  and on an additional year  million collateralized facility  with a weighted average fixed interest rate of  both with fannie mae nyse fnm 
the proceeds from these facilities were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our million unsecured credit facility  as discussed further under liquidity and capital resources 
beginning in the first quarter  the trust s board of trustees declared a reduced quarterly cash dividend on the trust s common shares and the partnership units of crlp of per common share and per partnership unit  compared with for the fourth quarter the per share unit reduction in the aggregate annual dividend amount from prior year has enabled us to retain approximately million of cash 
additionally  in february  the trust s board of trustees authorized management to issue up to million of common shares of the trust under a continuous equity issuance program  which we expect to put in place during the first quarter of these actions were intended to help us further improve our liquidity position  enhance our ability to take advantage of opportunities and help protect against uncertainties in the capital markets 
addressing near term maturities during the year ended december   we focused on addressing our near term maturities through repurchases of outstanding unsecured senior notes of crlp as we continued to see significant discounts 
since inception of our repurchase efforts in  which included a million repurchase program announced during  a million tender offer and an additional million tender offer  we have repurchased an aggregate of million of outstanding unsecured senior notes  recognizing aggregate net gains of approximately million 
of this amount  we repurchased million in unsecured senior notes during the year ended december   at an average discount of to par value  which 
table of contents represents an yield to maturity and resulted in the recognition of net gains of million 
as a result of these repurchases  at december   we have only million of unsecured notes maturing in in january  the trust s board of trustees authorized a new million unsecured notes repurchase program the prior repurchase program expired at the end of and a new million series d preferred share repurchase program 
we will continue to monitor the bond market in and take advantage of favorable conditions to repurchase outstanding crlp notes and or trust preferred shares 
in addition to our successful unsecured note repurchase program  we made significant progress in simplifying our business during the fourth quarter of  which included addressing our unconsolidated debt maturities associated with certain joint ventures 
during  we exited seven of our joint ventures including properties and eliminated million of our pro rata share of property specific mortgage debt exposure 
in particular  during the fourth quarter of  we eliminated million of near term debt maturity exposure through the disposition of our interest in the asset dra crt office joint venture with dra advisors llc and through the disposition of our interest in the asset oz clp retail llc joint venture 
these joint venture dispositions not only helped us to address near term debt maturities  but also reduced our overall leverage and further strengthened the balance sheet see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements of the trust and crlp contained in item of this form k for additional details 
as of december   we had million available on our unsecured credit facility  with million in development spending remaining on active projects  no debt secured by consolidated properties maturing in and million of joint venture debt maturing in of which million is available to be extended by the joint venture 
therefore  we believe  based on our current strategy  that we have adequate liquidity in order to address our capital needs through  including the remaining million of unsecured consolidated debt maturing in reducing overhead since october  we have aggressively cut overhead costs  primarily through the elimination of employee positions many of which were construction  development and leasing personnel 
these actions resulted in us incurring million and million in termination benefits and severance related charges in and  respectively 
with the staff reductions in  we have now reduced the size of our total workforce by more than compared to the workforce size as of october with these reductions  we expect to generate approximately million in annualized savings 
throughout  we intend to continue focusing on controlling costs  which will  in turn  help preserve capital and improve liquidity 
postponing phasing developments as previously disclosed  in january  we decided to postpone phase future development activities until we determined that the current economic environment had sufficiently improved 
our development expenditures for the year ended december  were million  and we anticipate total expenditures for to be approximately to million 
expenditures for include completing one commercial development project and phase i of the development at our colonial promenade nord du lac property 
postponing phasing future development activities has helped us preserve capital during this uncertain economic environment 
we believe that the steps that we have made to achieve our objectives have positioned us to be able to continue to work through this challenging economic environment 
looking ahead to  we will continue to simplify the business by looking for opportunities to exit additional joint ventures 
we expect that property level margins will continue to be under pressure for the majority of  but we will look to improve our overall corporate operating margins through the disposition of our non income producing assets and through controlling expenses 
we will look to further strengthen the balance sheet and grow the company through debt repurchases and the funding of new acquisitions through existing availability under our unsecured credit facility and the issuance of common equity 
executive summary of results of operations the following discussion of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of operations of the trust and crlp and the operating results summary included below 
for the year ended december   the trust reported a net loss to common shareholders of million  compared with a net loss to common shareholders of million for the comparable prior year period 
for the year ended december   crlp reported a net loss to common unitholders of million  compared with a net loss to common unitholders of million for the comparable prior year period

liquidity and capital resources the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the trust and crlp contained in item of this form k 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  decreased million from the comparable prior year period for the trust  to million from million  and decreased million from the comparable prior year period for crlp  to million from million 
the decrease in cash provided was due to the decline in operating performance of our fully stabilized communities 
in  we expect cash flows from operating activities 
table of contents to be consistent with or slightly less than primarily driven by the challenging economic environment and a projected decrease in our core multifamily operations 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  decreased million to million from million for the comparable prior year period for the trust and crlp 
the change was primarily due to reduced development expenditures and a decline in property sales during  which was offset by the acquisitions of three ravinia and colonial promenade alabaster  as well as the purchase of the colonial promenade nord du lac community development district bonds 
in  we expect cash used in investing activities to be consistent or slightly less than levels as we continue to strengthen the balance sheet by disposing of non core assets and reducing expenditures attributable to our development pipeline  while continuing to pursue valuable acquisition opportunities 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash used in financing activities in the comparable prior year period of million for the trust 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash used in financing activities in the comparable prior year period of million for crlp 
the change in was primarily the result of our successful equity offerings  generating million of net cash proceeds 
for  our focus continues to be on our balance sheet as our board of trustees recently approved an additional million unsecured senior note repurchase program as well as a million series d preferred repurchase program 
we believe that our business strategy  the availability of borrowings under our credit facilities and limited debt maturities in has us positioned well to work through this challenging economic environment including the volatile capital and credit markets 
short term liquidity needs our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses directly associated with our portfolio of properties including regular maintenance items  capital expenditures incurred to lease our space eg  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding debt  and quarterly distributions that we pay to the trust s common and preferred shareholders and holders of partnership units in crlp 
in the past  we have primarily satisfied these requirements through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our unsecured credit facility 
the majority of our revenue is derived from residents and tenants under existing leases  primarily at our multifamily properties 
therefore  our operating cash flow is dependent upon the rents that we are able to charge to our residents and tenants  and the ability of these residents and tenants to make their rental payments 
the weak economy and job market in the us  has resulted in deterioration in the multifamily market generally  and has adversely affected our ability to lease our multifamily properties as well as the rents we are able to charge and thereby adversely affected our revenues 
we believe that cash generated from operations  dispositions of assets and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
however  factors described below and elsewhere herein may have a material adverse effect on our future cash flow 
we have made an election to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  commencing with our taxable year ending december  if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our shareholders 
even if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income 
long term liquidity needs our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay the principal amount of our long term debt as it matures  significant capital expenditures that need to be made at our properties  development projects that we undertake and costs associated with acquisitions of properties that we pursue 
historically  we have satisfied these requirements principally through the most advantageous source of capital at that time  which has included the incurrence of new debt through borrowings through public offerings of unsecured debt and private incurrence of collateralized and unsecured debt  sales of common and preferred shares  capital raised through the disposition of assets and joint venture capital transactions 

table of contents the trust has filed a registration statement with the sec allowing us to offer  from time to time  equity securities of the trust including common or preferred shares for an aggregate initial public offering price of up to million on an as needed basis subject to our ability to affect offerings on satisfactory terms based on prevailing conditions 
as described above in the business strategy and outlook section  we issued  common shares of the trust through our continuous equity offering program and  common shares of the trust through a separate public offering generating aggregate net proceeds of million 
the proceeds were used to repay a portion of our unsecured credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
pursuant to the crlp s third amended and restated agreement of limited partnership  each time the trust issues common shares pursuant to the foregoing program  crlp issues to the trust  its general partner  an equal number of units for the same price at which the common shares were sold 
our ability to raise funds through sales of common shares and preferred shares in the future is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about our company and the current trading price of our shares 
the financial and economic crisis and deterioration in the stock and credit markets over the past year and a half have resulted in significant price volatility  which have caused market prices of many stocks  including the price of the trust s common shares  to fluctuate substantially 
with respect to both debt and equity  a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly 
these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of the trust s common shares  preferred shares or subordinated notes or through private financings 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but the equity and credit markets may not be consistently available on terms that are attractive 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our credit ratings  the value of our assets  our degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by our current lenders 
as discussed below in credit ratings  earlier this year  we received credit rating downgrades  making it less favorable and less likely  that we will access the unsecured public debt market in the foreseeable future 
in light of the credit downgrades  during we were able to obtain secured financing of million  for a year term  through fannie mae 
the proceeds from those financings were used to repay a portion of our unsecured credit facility 
in  we intend to continue to access secured borrowings through fannie mae and or freddie mac  as market conditions permit 
our ability to generate cash from asset sales is limited by market conditions and certain rules applicable to reits 
in the current market  our ability to sell properties to raise cash is challenging 
for example  we may not be able to sell a property or properties as quickly as we have in the past or on terms as favorable as we have previously received 
during  we sold assets for aggregate proceeds of approximately million million from consolidated assets  million from unconsolidated assets  which represents our pro rata share of the proceeds  million from condominium conversion and for sale residential assets and million from land sales  including million which is our pro rata share from an unconsolidated land parcel 
at december   our total outstanding debt balance was billion 
the outstanding balance includes fixed rate debt of billion  or of the total debt balance  and floating rate debt of million  or of the total debt balance 
our total market capitalization as of december  was billion  which includes joint venture debt 
as further discussed below  at december   we had an unsecured revolving credit facility providing for total borrowings of up to million and a cash management line providing for borrowings up to million 
distributions the dividend on the trust s common shares and crlp s partnership units was per share and per partnership unit per quarter for the first quarter of and per share and per partnership unit for the last three quarters of  or per share and per partnership unit during this reduced dividend compared to the dividend level during has allowed us to improve our liquidity position  further enhance our ability to take advantage of opportunities  and protect against uncertainties in the capital markets 
we also pay regular quarterly distributions on preferred shares in the trust and on preferred units in crlp 
the maintenance of these distributions is subject to various factors  including the discretion of the trust s board of trustees  the trust s ability to pay dividends under alabama law  the availability of cash to make the necessary dividend payments and the effect of reit distribution requirements  which require at least of the trust s taxable income to be distributed to the trust s shareholders excluding net capital gains 
unsecured revolving credit facility as of december   crlp  with the trust as guarantor  has a million unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility with wachovia bank  national association  a subsidiary of wells fargo company wachovia  as agent for the lenders  bank of america  na as syndication agent  wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo  
table of contents citicorp north america  inc and regions bank  as co documentation agents  and us bank national association and pnc bank  national association  as co senior managing agents and other lenders named therein 
the credit facility has a maturity date of june  in addition to the credit facility  we have a million cash management line provided by wachovia that will expire on june  the cash management line had an outstanding balance of million as of december  base rate loans and revolving loans are available under the credit facility 
the credit facility also includes a competitive bid feature that allows us to convert up to million under the credit facility to a fixed rate and for a fixed term not to exceed days 
generally  base rate loans bear interest at wachovia s designated base rate  plus a base rate margin ranging up to based on our unsecured debt ratings from time to time 
revolving loans bear interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to based on our unsecured debt ratings 
competitive bid loans bear interest at libor plus a margin  as specified by the participating lenders 
based on crlp s unsecured debt rating downgrade  the revolving loans currently bear interest at a rate of libor plus basis points 
the credit facility and cash management line  which are primarily used to finance property acquisitions and developments and more recently to also fund repurchases of crlp senior notes  had an aggregate outstanding balance at december  of million 
the interest rate of the credit facility including the cash management line was and at december  and  respectively 
the credit facility contains various ratios and covenants that are more fully described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements of the trust and crlp included in item of this form k 
the ongoing recession and continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to generate earnings sufficient to maintain compliance with these ratios and other debt covenants in the future 
we expect to be able to comply with these ratios and covenants in  but no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain compliance with these ratios and other debt covenants  particularly if economic conditions worsen 
as described above  many of the recent disruptions in the financial markets have been brought about in large part by failures in the us banking system 
if any of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us under the credit facility or otherwise are adversely affected by the conditions of the financial markets  they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us under the credit facility  the cash management line or otherwise 
if our lenders become unable to fund our borrowings pursuant to their commitments to us  we may need to obtain replacement financing  and such financing  if available  may not be available on commercially attractive terms

credit ratings our current corporate credit ratings are as follows rating agency rating last update fitch bb may  moody s ba september  standard poor s bb october  ratings outlook is stable 
ratings outlook is negative 
in march  moody s investors service lowered the credit rating on crlp s senior unsecured debt to ba from baa and standard poor s lowered the credit rating on crlp s senior unsecured debt to bb from bbb 
while the downgrades by both moody s investors service and standard poor s do not affect our ability to draw proceeds under our unsecured line of credit  the pricing on the credit facility was adjusted from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points as a 
table of contents result of those downgrades 
in addition  on may   fitch ratings lowered the credit rating on clp to bb from bbb and on crlp s unsecured revolving credit facility and senior unsecured notes to bb from bbb 
fitch also revised its rating outlook from negative to stable 
fitch had previously revised its rating outlook from stable to negative in march the previous downgrade by fitch does not affect our ability to draw proceeds under our unsecured line of credit or otherwise result in any pricing or other changes under our unsecured credit facility 
see item a risk factors risks associated with our indebtedness and financing activities a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we experience a credit downgrade  we may be limited in our access to capital in the unsecured debt market  which we have historically utilized to fund our investment activities 
in addition  as previously discussed  our spread on our unsecured credit facility would increase 
market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes that could affect our results of operations and financial condition or cash flow 
we limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures  including the use of derivative instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risk 
however  interest rate swap agreements and other hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks  including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations 
developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes at december  in thousands estimated fair thereafter total value fixed rate debt average interest rate at december  variable debt average interest rate at december  n a n a n a n a n a the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  it does not consider those exposures or positions  which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time  and interest rates 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding floating rate debt 
we do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by our floating rate debt is material in relation to our billion of outstanding total debt and our billion of total assets as of december  if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase by  the increase in annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt decrease by  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
this assumes that the amount outstanding under our variable rate debt remains approximately million  the balance as of december  our objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  we primarily use interest rate swaps including forward starting interest rate swaps and caps as part of our cash flow hedging strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
as of december   we had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 

table of contents at december   and  there were no derivatives included in other assets 
there was no change in net unrealized gains losses in or the change in net unrealized gains losses of million in for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is separately disclosed in the statements of changes in shareholders equity and comprehensive income loss 
at december   and  there were no derivatives that were not designated as hedges 
there was no hedge ineffectiveness during  and as of december   all of our hedges are designated as cash flow hedges  and we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense and debt cost amortization as interest payments are made on our hedged debt or to gains losses on hedging activities at such time that the interest payments on the hedged debt become no longer probable to occur as originally specified 
a portion of the interest payments on the hedged debt became no longer probable to occur as a result of our bond repurchase program see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements of the trust and crlp contained in item of this form k for additional details 
the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss for reclassifications to interest expense and debt cost amortization tied to interest payments made on the hedged debt was million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss for reclassification to gains losses on hedging activities related to interest payments on the hedged debt that have been deemed no longer probable to occur as a result of repurchases under our senior note repurchase program were losses of million and million during and  respectively  with no impact during during may  we settled a million interest rate swap and received a payment of approximately million 
this interest rate swap was in place to convert a portion of the floating rate payments on our credit facility to a fixed rate 
this derivative originally qualified for hedge accounting  however  in may of  due to our office and retail joint venture transactions and the expected resulting pay down of our then outstanding term loan and credit facility  this derivative no longer qualified for hedge accounting which resulted in a gain of approximately million 
further  we have a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  we have not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives

in connection with the dispute  in january  the contractor filed a lawsuit against us alleging  among other things  breach of contract  enforcement of a lien against real property  misrepresentation  conversion  declaratory judgment and an accounting of costs  and is seeking million in damages  plus consequential and punitive damages 
certain of the subcontractors  vendors and other parties  involved in the projects  including purchasers of units  have also made claims in the form of lien claims  general claims or lawsuits 
we have been sued by purchasers of certain condominium units alleging breach of contract  fraud  construction deficiencies and misleading sales practices 
both compensatory and punitive damages are sought in these actions 
some of these claims have been resolved by negotiations and mediations  and others may also be similarly resolved 
some of these claims will likely be arbitrated or litigated to conclusion 
we are continuing to evaluate our options and investigate certain of these claims  including possible claims against the contractor and other parties 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims 
however  no prediction of the likelihood  or amount  of any resulting loss or recovery can be made at this time and no assurance can be given that the matter will be resolved favorably 
in connection with certain retail developments  we have received funding from municipalities for infrastructure costs 
in most cases  the municipalities issue bonds that are repaid primarily from sales tax revenues generated from the tenants at each respective development 
we have guaranteed the shortfall  if any  of tax revenues to the debt service requirements on the bonds 
the total amount outstanding on these bonds is approximately million at december  and at december  and december   no liability was recorded for these guarantees 
as previously disclosed  we postponed most future development activities 
of these developments  the only one that we currently expect to resume development on in  is the first phase of the colonial promenade nord du lac commercial development  located in covington  louisiana

summary of critical accounting policies we believe our accounting policies are in conformity with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
a comprehensive listing of our significant accounting policies is discussed in note in our notes to consolidated financial statements of the trust and crlp contained in item of this form k 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical to our reported operating results principles of consolidation we consolidate entities in which we have a controlling interest or entities where we are determined to be the primary beneficiary under asc  control of partnerships and similar entities 
variable interest entities vies are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability 
the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the vie for financial reporting purposes 
revenue recognition residential properties are leased under operating leases with terms of generally one year or less 
rental revenues from residential leases are recognized on the straight line method over the approximate life of the leases  which is generally one year 
the recognition of rental revenues from residential leases when earned has historically not been materially different from rental revenues recognized on a straight line basis 
under the terms of residential leases  the residents of our residential communities are obligated to reimburse us for certain utility usage  cable  water  electricity and trash  where we are the primary obligor to the public utility entity 
these utility reimbursements from residents are included as other property related revenue in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
rental income attributable to commercial leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases 
certain commercial leases contain provisions for additional rent based on a percentage of tenant sales 
percentage rents are recognized in the period in which sales thresholds are met 
recoveries from tenants for taxes  insurance  and other property operating expenses are recognized in the period the applicable costs are incurred in accordance with the terms of the related lease 
sales and the associated gains or losses on real estate assets  condominium conversion projects and for sale residential projects including developed condominiums are recognized in accordance with asc  real estate sales 
for condominium conversion and for sale residential projects  sales and the associated gains for individual condominium units are recognized upon the closing of the sale transactions  as all conditions for full profit recognition have been met completed contract method 
we use the relative sales value method to allocate costs and recognize profits from condominium conversion and for sale residential sales 
real estate assets  impairment and depreciation land  buildings  and equipment is stated at the lower of cost  less accumulated depreciation  or fair value 
undeveloped land and construction in progress is stated at cost unless such assets are impaired in which case such assets are recorded at fair value 
we review our long lived assets and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the asset s fair value 
assets classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we determine fair value based on inputs management believes are consistent with those other market participants would use 
estimates are significantly impacted by estimates of sales price  selling velocity  sales incentives  construction costs and other factors 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  actual results could differ from such estimates 
for those assets deemed to be 
table of contents impaired  the impairment to be recognized is to be measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  as follows useful lives buildings years furniture and fixtures or years equipment or years land improvements or years tenant improvements life of lease repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred 
replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets 
cost capitalization costs incurred during predevelopment are capitalized after we have identified a development site  determined that a project is feasible and concluded that it is probable that the project will proceed 
while we believe we will recover this capital through the successful development of such projects  it is possible that a write off of unrecoverable amounts could occur 
once it is no longer probable that a development will be successful  the predevelopment costs that have been previously capitalized are expensed 
the capitalization of costs during the development of assets including interest  property taxes and other direct costs begins when an active development commences and ends when the asset  or a portion of an asset  is delivered and is ready for its intended use 
cost capitalization during redevelopment of assets including interest and other direct costs begins when the asset is taken out of service for redevelopment and ends when the asset redevelopment is completed and the asset is placed in service 
acquisition of real estate assets we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with asc  business combinations  which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and tenant improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases and value of other tenant relationships  based in each case on the fair values 
we allocate purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes the land and building determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant 
the as if vacant value is allocated to land and buildings based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets 
we also allocate value to tenant improvements based on the estimated costs of similar tenants with similar terms 
we record acquired intangible assets including above market leases  customer relationships and in place leases and acquired intangible liabilities including below market leases at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill 
we amortize identified intangible assets and liabilities that are determined to have finite lives over the period the assets and liabilities are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired 
intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 
inflation leases at the multifamily properties generally provide for an initial term of six months to one year and allow for rent adjustments at the time of renewal 
leases at the office properties typically provide for rent adjustments and the pass through of certain operating expenses during the term of the lease 
substantially all of the leases at the retail properties provide for the pass through to tenants of certain operating costs  including real estate taxes  common area maintenance expenses  and insurance 
all of these provisions permit us to increase rental rates or other charges to tenants in response to rising prices and  therefore  serve to minimize our exposure to the adverse effects of inflation 

table of contents an increase in general price levels may immediately precede  or accompany  an increase in interest rates 
at december   our exposure to rising interest rates was mitigated by our high percentage of consolidated fixed rate debt 
as it relates to the short term  an increase in interest expense resulting from increasing inflation is anticipated to be less than future increases in income before interest 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  means income loss before noncontrolling interest determined in accordance with gaap  excluding sales of depreciated property  plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented to assist investors in analyzing our performance 
we believe that ffo is useful to investors because it provides an additional indicator of our financial and operating performance 
this is because  by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation and gains or losses from sales of properties all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparison of operating performance among equity reits 
ffo is a widely recognized measure in the company s industry 
we believe that the line on our consolidated statements of operations entitled net income available to common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
management believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has been fundamentally beneficial  improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
in addition to company management evaluating the operating performance of our reportable segments based on ffo results  management uses ffo and ffo per share  along with other measures  to assess performance in connection with evaluating and granting incentive compensation to key employees 
our method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap  as an indicator of financial performance  as cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity nor is it indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs  including our ability to make distributions 
the following information is provided to reconcile net income available to common shareholders  the most comparable gaap financial measure  to ffo  and to show the items included in our ffo for the years ended december     and
