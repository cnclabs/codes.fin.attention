see part i  item ia  risk factors in this annual report 
business overview trends and economic environment our new management team remains committed to growing our oem business 
however  we also intend to pursue a more marketing and product development driven business model to expand our product offerings through retail distribution channels  marking a significant evolution in our strategy in the consumer electronics and technology accessories segment 
in executing this strategy  we are likely to incur significantly increased selling  general  and administrative expense  as we devote increased resources to develop and or acquire new product offerings  diversified sales channels  and an improved capability to sell and distribute under this model 
the realization of the benefits of these initiatives will be determined by the speed in which we can bring new products to market and by the success and acceptance of these products in the marketplace 
we continue to believe that meaningful improvement to our results of operations will be driven by revenue growth 
with regard to the growth of our oem business  recent gains in sales orders from certain of our major diabetic product customers have been encouraging  but the magnitude is modest  and we believe that the sustainability of improvement in revenues from these customers is uncertain 
furthermore  we continue to operate in a very challenging business environment  where changes in revenue contribution from our major diabetic case customers  with whom we are highly concentrated  are somewhat volatile 
we expect further progress in fiscal in our efforts to expand our oem customer and product base and reduce such concentration  and anticipate that we can build on the growth in revenue contributed by other products in fiscal previously  we have disclosed our intention to expand and or diversify our business by means of acquisition 
management is committed to building our business in the electronics and technology accessories segment and has continued to evaluate acquisition opportunities 
if an acquisition of any business should be consummated  the company would likely become obliged to commit some combination of cash  stock  and other resources to acquire and or integrate such business and or its personnel 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report variability of revenues and results of operation because a high percentage of our sales revenues is highly concentrated in a few large customers  and because the volumes of these customers order flows to us are highly variable  with short lead times  our quarterly revenues  and consequently our results of operations  are susceptible to significant variability over a relatively short period of time 
forward industries  inc critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the accounting policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the discussion below is not intended to be comprehensive 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment of a particular transaction 
in other cases  management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion of the applications of these and other accounting policies  refer to
