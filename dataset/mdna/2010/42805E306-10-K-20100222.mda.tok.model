item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in items and of this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements  which include statements concerning future revenue sources and concentration  gross profit margins  selling and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  capital resources  additional financings or borrowings and additional losses  are subject to risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k  particularly in item a risk factors  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
the forward looking statements set forth in this form k are as of february   and we undertake no duty to update this information 
overview we develop  manufacture  market  sell and support veterinary products 
our business is comprised of two reportable segments  core companion animal health  which represented of our revenue  and other vaccines  pharmaceuticals and products which represented of our revenue 
the core companion animal health segment cca includes diagnostic and other instruments and supplies as well as single use diagnostic and other tests  pharmaceuticals and vaccines  primarily for canine and feline use 
diagnostic and other instruments and supplies represented approximately of our revenue 
many products in this area involve placing an instrument in the field and generating future revenue from consumables  including items such as supplies and service  as that instrument is used 
approximately of our revenue resulted from the sale of such consumables to an installed base of instruments and approximately of our revenue was from new hardware sales 
a loss of or disruption in supply of consumables we are selling to an installed base of instruments could substantially harm our business 
for example  the supplier of our handheld blood analysis instruments informed us in may of the cancellation of our contractual agreement as of november and that they would not supply us with any related instruments or consumables following cancellation 
we had established a large installed base of handheld blood analysis instruments and sales of instruments and affiliated consumables in this area represented of our revenue 
accordingly  we anticipate a significant decline in revenue and gross margin related to our handheld blood analysis instruments in as compared to all products in this area are supplied by third parties  who typically own the product rights and supply the product to us under marketing and or distribution agreements 
in many cases  we have collaborated with a third party to adapt a human instrument for veterinary use 
major products in this area include our chemistry instruments and our hematology instruments and their affiliated operating consumables 
revenue from these two areas  including revenue from consumables  represented approximately of our revenue 
other cca revenue  including single use diagnostic and other tests  pharmaceuticals and vaccines as well as research and development  licensing and royalty revenue  represented approximately of our revenue 
since items in this area are single use by their nature  our aim is to build customer satisfaction and loyalty for each product  generate repeat annual sales from existing customers and expand our customer base in the future 
products in this area are both supplied by third parties and provided by us 
major products in this area include our heartworm diagnostic tests  our heartworm preventive  our allergy test kits  our allergy immunotherapy and our allergy diagnostic tests 
combined revenue from heartworm related products and allergy related products represented approximately of our revenue 

table of contents we consider the cca segment to be our core business and devote most of our management time and other resources to improving the prospects for this segment 
maintaining a continuing  reliable and economic supply of products we currently obtain from third parties is critical to our success in this area 
virtually all of our sales and marketing expenses are in the core companion animal health segment 
the majority of our research and development spending is dedicated to this segment  as well 
we strive to provide high value products and advance the state of veterinary medicine 
all our cca products are ultimately sold to or through veterinarians 
in many cases  veterinarians will mark up their costs to the end user 
the acceptance of our products by veterinarians is critical to our success 
cca products are sold directly by us as well as through independent third party distributors and other distribution relationships  such as our corporate agreement with spah and the sale of kits to conduct blood testing to third party veterinary diagnostic laboratories 
revenue from direct sales  independent third party distributors and other distribution relationships represented approximately  and of core companion animal health product revenue  respectively 
in early  we gave notice of contract termination to most domestic independent third party distributors who carry our full product line and  accordingly  we anticipate the percent of our revenue from sale to independent third party distributors to decline in as compared to we took this action because we expect it will enhance our profitability and allow further investment in our direct sales efforts  which we expect to yield a greater return than continuing in our agreements with our previous independent third party distributors 
we intend to increase profitability through a combination of revenue growth  gross margin improvement and expense control 
accordingly  we closely monitor revenue growth trends in our cca segment 
revenue in this segment decreased by million  or  in as compared to the largest factor in this decline was lower sales of consumables for our handheld blood analysis instruments which declined by million in as compared to  primarily due to the loss of supply discussed above 
in addition  we believe poor economic conditions over the past year have impacted our revenue growth as  for example  veterinarians have delayed or deferred capital expenditures on new diagnostic instrumentation 
the other vaccines  pharmaceuticals and products segment ovp includes our  square foot usda and fda licensed production facility in des moines  iowa 
we view this facility as an asset which will allow us to control our cost of goods on any vaccines and pharmaceuticals that we may commercialize in the future 
virtually all our us inventory is now stored at this facility and fulfillment logistics are managed there 
cca segment products manufactured at this facility are transferred at cost and are not recorded as revenue for our ovp segment 
we view ovp reported revenue as revenue primarily to cover the overhead costs of the facility and to generate incremental cash flow to fund our cca segment 
our ovp segment includes private label vaccine and pharmaceutical production  primarily for cattle but also for other animals such as small mammals 
all ovp products are sold by third parties under third party labels 
we have developed our own line of bovine vaccines that are licensed by the usda 
we have a long term  non exclusive agreement with a distributor  agri laboratories  ltd  agrilabs  for the marketing and sale of certain of these vaccines which are sold primarily under the titanium and masterguard brands which are registered trademarks of agrilabs 
this agreement generates a significant portion of our ovp segment s revenue 
our ovp segment also produces vaccines and pharmaceuticals for other third parties 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods 
these estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we have identified those critical accounting policies used in reporting our financial position and results of operations based upon a consideration of those accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessment 
we consider the following to be our critical policies 
revenue recognition we generate our revenue through the sale of products  as well as through licensing of technology product rights  royalties and sponsored research and development 
our policy is to recognize revenue when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met  which generally include the following persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized after both the goods are shipped to the customer and acceptance has been received  if required  with an appropriate provision for estimated returns and allowances 
we do not permit general returns of products sold 
certain of our products have expiration dates 
our policy is to exchange certain outdated  expired product with the same product 
we record an accrual for the estimated cost of replacing the expired product expected to be returned in the future  based on our historical experience  adjusted for any known factors that reasonably could be expected to change historical patterns  such as regulatory actions which allow us to extend the shelf life of our products 
revenue from both direct sales to veterinarians and sales to independent third party distributors are generally recognized when goods are shipped 
our products are shipped complete and ready to use by the customer 
the terms of the customer arrangements generally pass title and risk of ownership to the customer at the time of shipment 
certain customer arrangements provide for acceptance provisions 
revenue for these arrangements is not recognized until the acceptance has been received or the acceptance period has lapsed 
we reduce our revenue by the estimated cost of any rebates  allowances or similar programs  which are used as promotional programs 
recording revenue from the sale of products involves the use of estimates and management judgment 
we must make a determination at the time of sale whether the customer has the ability to make payments in accordance with arrangements 
while we do utilize past payment history  and  to the extent available for new customers  public credit information in making our assessment  the determination of whether collectability is reasonably assured is ultimately a judgment decision that must be made by management 
we must also make estimates regarding our future obligation relating to returns  rebates  allowances and similar other programs 
license revenue under arrangements to sell or license product rights or technology rights is recognized as obligations under the agreement are satisfied  which generally occurs over a period of time 
generally  licensing revenue is deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the related agreements  products  patents or technology 
nonrefundable licensing fees  marketing rights and milestone payments received under contractual arrangements are deferred and recognized over the remaining contractual term using the straight line method 

table of contents recording revenue from license arrangements involves the use of estimates 
the primary estimate made by management is determining the useful life of the related agreement  product  patent or technology 
we evaluate all of our licensing arrangements by estimating the useful life of either the product or the technology  the length of the agreement or the legal patent life and defer the revenue for recognition over the appropriate period 
occasionally we enter into arrangements that include multiple elements 
such arrangements may include the licensing of technology and manufacturing of product 
in these situations we must determine whether the various elements meet the criteria to be accounted for as separate elements 
if the elements cannot be separated  revenue is recognized once revenue recognition criteria for the entire arrangement have been met or over the period that the company s obligations to the customer are fulfilled  as appropriate 
if the elements are determined to be separable  the revenue is allocated to the separate elements based on relative fair value and recognized separately for each element when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in accounting for these multiple element arrangements  we must make determinations about whether elements can be accounted for separately and make estimates regarding their relative fair values 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on client specific allowances  as well as a general allowance 
specific allowances are maintained for clients which are determined to have a high degree of collectability risk based on such factors  among others  as i the aging of the accounts receivable balance  ii the client s past payment experience  iii a deterioration in the client s financial condition  evidenced by weak financial condition and or continued poor operating results  reduced credit ratings  and or a bankruptcy filing 
in addition to the specific allowance  the company maintains a general allowance for credit risk in its accounts receivable which is not covered by a specific allowance 
the general allowance is established based on such factors  among others  as i the total balance of the outstanding accounts receivable  including considerations of the aging categories of those accounts receivable  ii past history of uncollectable accounts receivable write offs  and iii the overall creditworthiness of the client base 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realizability of accounts receivable 
should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of the overall allowance change  an adjustment to the provision for doubtful accounts receivable may be necessary 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
inventories are written down if the estimated net realizable value of an inventory item is less than its recorded value 
we review the carrying cost of our inventories by product each quarter to determine the adequacy of our reserves for obsolescence 
in accounting for inventories we must make estimates regarding the estimated net realizable value of our inventory 
this estimate is based  in part  on our forecasts of future sales and shelf life of product 

table of contents deferred tax assets valuation allowance our deferred tax assets  such as a net operating loss carryforward nol  are reduced by an offsetting valuation allowance based on judgmental assessment of available evidence if we are unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all of the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
if we are able to conclude it is more likely than not that we will realize a future benefit from a deferred tax asset  we will reduce the related valuation allowance by an amount equal to the estimated quantity of income taxes we would pay in cash if we were not to utilize the deferred tax asset in the future 
the first time this occurs in a given jurisdiction  it will result in a net deferred tax asset on our balance sheet and an income tax benefit of equal magnitude in our statement of operations in the period we make the determination 
in future periods  we will then recognize as income tax expense the estimated quantity of income taxes we would have paid in cash had we not utilized the related deferred tax asset 
the corresponding journal entry will be a reduction of our deferred tax asset 
if there is a change regarding our tax position in the future  we will make a corresponding adjustment to the related valuation allowance

table of contents revenue total revenue decreased to million in compared to million in total revenue decreased to million in compared to million in cca segment revenue decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the largest factor in this decline was lower sales of consumables for our handheld blood analysis instruments which declined by million in as compared to  primarily due to the loss of supply following cancellation of the underlying contract by our supplier 
other factors in the decline were lower sales of our chemistry instruments and our microalbumin laboratory packs 
these declines were somewhat offset by increased sales of our non handheld related instrument consumables  international sales of our heartworm diagnostic tests and sales of our heartworm preventive 
cca segment revenue increased to million in compared to million in key factors in the increase were greater sales of our chemistry instrument  which was launched in november  our instrument consumables and our heartworm diagnostic tests  somewhat offset by lower sales of our handheld blood analysis instruments and our heartworm preventive  both internationally and domestically 
ovp segment revenue decreased to million in compared to million in the largest factor in this decline was loss of fish vaccine revenue from aquahealth  a unit of novartis  a customer who had previously informed us that they would be taking their production in house and accordingly ordered no product from us in lower revenue under our contract with agrilabs and lower sales of bulk bovine biologicals also contributed to the year over year decline in this segment 
ovp segment revenue decreased to million in compared to million in the largest factor in the decrease was approximately million in revenue the united revenue recognized in upon receipt of a payment for product previously shipped and take or pay minimums for and which previously had not been paid as part of a now settled dispute with united vaccines  inc uv  a former customer 
as uv had ceased operations  we did not generate any corresponding revenue from uv in this decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in sales of bovine vaccines under our contract with agrilabs 
we expect total revenue to increase slightly as compared with cost of revenue cost of revenue totaled million for the twelve months ended december   an decrease as compared to million for the corresponding period in gross profit decreased to million for as compared to million in gross margin  ie gross profit divided by total revenue  increased to for as compared to in lower reserves taken against inventory we expect to expire prior to sale  primarily related to consumables for our chemistry instruments and our handheld diagnostic instruments were a factor in the increase 
another factor in the increase was revenue mix as a lower percentage of revenue in was related to our ovp segment  which tends to generate lower gross margin than our cca segment 
cost of revenue was million  an increase of compared to million in gross profit decreased to million in from million in gross margin decreased to in from in the largest factor in the increase was recognition of the united revenue in for which the affiliated cost of products sold had been recognized in prior periods and for which no corresponding revenue or gross profit was recognized in in addition  product mix and increased reserves taken against inventory we expected to expire prior to sale  primarily related to consumables for our new chemistry instrument and our handheld diagnostic instruments  were factors in the decrease 
we expect gross margin to increase in as compared to 
table of contents operating expenses selling and marketing expenses decreased by to million in compared to million in key factors in the decline were lower expenses related to product launches  decreased expenditures on market research and lower commissions 
selling and marketing expenses increased by to million in compared to million in key factors in the change were an increase in personnel and increased expenditures on market research 
research and development expenses decreased by thousand to million in from million in a key factor in the decline was lower spending on research and development resources  such as laboratory supplies 
research and development expenses decreased by thousand to million in from million in a key factor in the change was less space at our corporate headquarters being used for research and development activities 
in late  we implemented a plan to move and expand space for certain activities within our corporate headquarters  which reduced the space dedicated to research and development activities 
general and administrative expenses were million in  an decrease as compared to million in a key factor in the decline was savings resulting from our restructuring at the end of general and administrative expenses were million in  a slight decrease as compared to a factor in the decline was no management incentive plan mip payouts were earned in while there was some corresponding mip payout earned in in  we recorded restructuring expenses of approximately thousand  consisting of approximately thousand related primarily to personnel severance and other costs for certain individuals affected by our restructuring in december and thousand related to inventory of discontinued products  including a monitoring product the manufacturer had informed us it no longer intends to support 
we recorded no restructuring expenses in or other operating expenses of approximately thousand in relate to an asset impairment charge related to certain rental instruments we owned 
in  we recognized a gain of approximately thousand on the sale of certain patents we held net of costs on this line 
we recognized no corresponding asset impairment charges or gains on patent sales in we expect operating expenses will be higher than in  primarily as a result of our increased investment in direct sales resources 
interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net was thousand in  as compared to thousand in and thousand in this line item includes interest expense  interest income and foreign currency gains and losses 
the largest factor in the decrease in as compared to was lower loan balances and lower market interest rates  somewhat offset by an increased interest rate spread negotiated with wells fargo in december foreign currency gains as compared to losses in were also a factor 
the largest factor in the increase in as compared to was greater borrowings under our revolving line of credit with wells fargo  somewhat offset by lower market interest rates 
foreign currency losses in as compared to gains in were also a factor 
we expect interest and other expense  net to decrease in as compared to as we anticipate our borrowings with wells fargo will be at lower interest rates than in starting in march due to changes in our interest rate negotiated with wells fargo in november 
table of contents income tax expense benefit in general  income tax expense or benefit can be broken into two categories current and deferred 
valuation allowance adjustments and net operating loss usage have been components of deferred income tax expense benefit in all years presented 
current income tax expense generally consists of taxes payable on tax returns for a given year 
these primarily relate to domestic federal alternative minimum tax payments required  although state taxes are also included in this category 
we have typically not had to pay much in cash taxes when we have generated taxable income due to our nol position in switzerland and in the united states 
our nol in switzerland expired at the end of  so we paid cash taxes in switzerland in and expect to do so in the future 
a valuation allowance adjustment is due to a change in circumstances that causes a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset in future years 
in the fourth quarter of  based on the company s profitable domestic operating performance  we concluded that a portion of our domestic deferred tax assets  which primarily consist of our domestic nol  was realizable on a more likely than not basis and the related valuation allowance was released  resulting in an income tax benefit of million  reported as a valuation allowance adjustment income tax benefit 
net operating loss usage represents the tax we would have paid had we not had an nol in a given jurisdiction  but did not pay 
we had domestic net operating loss usage of million in in  domestic deferred income tax expense  a non cash expense  represented million of our million tax expense 
in  domestic deferred income tax benefits related to our loss before income taxes was the primary reason we recorded a thousand income tax benefit 
in  the million valuation allowance adjustment related to our domestic nol discussed above was the primary reason for the million income tax benefit recorded 
in  we expect slightly higher income tax expense as we expect slightly higher pre tax income 
net income loss our net income was million as compared to a net loss of thousand in and net income of million in lower operating expenses were a key factor in the improvement in as compared to the decline in as compared to was due to the large valuation allowance adjustment related to our domestic nol recognized in  but not lower total revenue  lower gross margin and higher operating expenses for as compared to also contributed to the change 
we expect net income will be slightly higher in than in  primarily as a result of increased gross margin somewhat offset by increased operating expenses 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition we have incurred net cumulative negative cash flow from operations since our inception in for the year ended december   we had net income of million 
in  net cash provided by operations was million 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  working capital of million  million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit  discussed below  and thousand of other debt 

table of contents net cash flows from operating activities provided cash of million in as compared to providing cash of million in and using cash of million in the major factors in the improvement in as compared to were a million increase in net income  a million improvement in cash provided by inventory as we lowered our inventory levels at year end compared to year end  including relating to the loss of supply of consumables for our handheld diagnostic instruments  a million improvement in cash provided by accounts payable primarily due to inventory paid for in and received in to a greater degree than for inventory paid for in and received in  and a million improvement in deferred tax expense primarily related to the utilization of our domestic nol 
this was somewhat offset by a million decline in cash provided by accounts receivable as we lowered our accounts receivable balance to a greater degree from to than from to  a thousand decline in cash provided by depreciation and amortization with a key factor being lower depreciation related to instrumentation demonstration units and thousand decline in cash provided by accrued liabilities and other items  of which restructuring expenses recognized in but paid in cash in were a factor 
the major factors in the improvement in versus were a million improvement in cash provided by inventory as we lowered our inventory levels at year end compared to year end  a million improvement in cash provided by accrued liabilities and other related items primarily due to a relatively large cash payout from our mip in early  a million improvement in cash provided by accounts receivable primarily due to lower fourth quarter sales and million greater depreciation and amortization primarily related to full versus partial year depreciation on rental instruments we capitalized in this was somewhat offset by a million decrease in net income  partially mitigated by a million decrease in deferred tax benefit primarily due to the million valuation allowance adjustment related to our domestic nol recorded in  as well as a million increase in cash used for accounts payable which primarily relates to lower inventory received but not paid for at year end as compared to net cash flows from investing activities used cash of thousand in as compared to using cash of thousand in and using cash of million in expenditures for property and equipment totaled approximately thousand  thousand and million in  and  respectively 
the cash used in and was entirely for purchases of property and equipment 
in  this was somewhat offset by cash provided from the sale of certain patents 
purchases of property and equipment in decreased thousand as compared to  primarily due to lower purchases of property and equipment in our ovp segment 
purchases of property and equipment in decreased million as compared to a factor in the decrease was the launch of three major instruments in for which we capitalized demonstration and other units  with no corresponding instrument launches in net cash flows from financing activities used cash of million in  used cash of million in and provided cash of million in in  we used cash to reduce our borrowings under our line of credit by million and repay principal on term debt of thousand which was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in we used cash to reduce our borrowings under our line of credit by million and repay principal on term debt of thousand which was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon option exercises and in our employee stock purchase plan totaling thousand 
in  we increased our line of credit borrowings by million and received thousand from the issuance of common stock upon option exercises and in our employee stock purchase plan 
at december   we had a million asset based revolving line of credit with wells fargo which has a maturity date of december  at december   million was outstanding under this line of credit 
our ability to borrow under this line of credit varies based upon available cash  eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory 
on december   interest was charged at a stated rate of prime plus and was payable monthly 
based on an amendment to our agreement with wells fargo signed in november  we anticipate interest will be charged at a stated rate of month libor plus beginning on march  we are required to comply with various financial and non financial covenants  and we have made various representations and warranties 
among the financial covenants is a requirement to maintain a minimum liquidity cash plus excess borrowing base of million 
additional requirements include covenants for minimum capital monthly and minimum net income quarterly 
failure to comply with any of the covenants  representations or warranties could result in our being in default on the loan and could cause all outstanding amounts payable to wells fargo  including those discussed below  to become immediately due and payable or impact our ability to borrow under the agreement 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december  at december   our remaining available borrowing capacity based upon eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory under our revolving line of credit was approximately million 

table of contents at december   we also had outstanding obligations for long term debt totaling approximately thousand primarily related to three term loans with wells fargo 
one term loan is secured by real estate in iowa and had an outstanding balance at december  of approximately thousand due in monthly installments of  plus interest 
the term loan had a stated interest rate of prime plus on december  and is to be paid in full in april the other two term loans are secured by machinery and equipment at our des moines  iowa and loveland  colorado locations the equipment notes 
principal payments on the equipment notes of  plus interest are due monthly 
the equipment notes had a stated interest rate of prime plus on december  and are to be paid in full in august based on an amendment to our agreement with wells fargo signed in november  we anticipate interest on all three term loans will be charged at a stated rate of month libor plus beginning on march  at december   we had deferred revenue and other long term liabilities  net of current portion  of approximately million 
included in this total is approximately million of deferred revenue related to up front fees that have been received for certain product rights and technology rights out licensed 
these deferred amounts are being recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining lives of the agreements  products  patents or technology 
our primary short term need for capital  which is subject to change  is to fund our operations  which consist of continued sales and marketing  general and administrative and research and development efforts  working capital associated with increased product sales and capital expenditures relating to maintaining and developing our manufacturing operations 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the extent to which our marketing and selling efforts  as well as those of third parties who market  sell and distribute our products  are successful in increasing our revenue  the extent to which currently planned products and or technologies under development are successfully developed and achieve market acceptance  changes required by us by regulatory bodies to maintain our operations and other factors 
our financial plan for indicates that our available cash and cash equivalents  together with cash from operations and borrowings expected to be available under our revolving line of credit  will be sufficient to fund our operations through and into our financial plan for expects that we will have positive cash flow from operations 
however  our actual results may differ from this plan  and we may be required to consider alternative strategies 
we may be required to raise additional capital in the future 
if necessary  we expect to raise these additional funds through the sale of equity securities or refinancing loans currently outstanding on assets with historical appraised values significantly in excess of related debt 
there is no guarantee that additional capital will be available from these sources on acceptable terms  if at all  and certain of these sources may require approval by existing lenders 
if we cannot raise the additional funds through these options on acceptable terms or with the necessary timing  management could also reduce discretionary spending to decrease our cash burn rate through actions such as delaying or canceling budgeted hiring activities or marketing plans 
these actions would likely extend the then available cash and cash equivalents  and then available borrowings to some degree 
see risk factors in item a of this form k for a discussion of some of the factors that affect our capital raising alternatives 

table of contents a summary of our contractual obligations at december  is shown below payments due by period in thousands less than after total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt interest payments on debt line of credit operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations in addition to those agreements considered above where our contractual obligation is fixed  we are party to commercial agreements which may require us to make milestone payments under certain circumstances 
all milestone obligations which we believe are likely to be triggered but are not yet paid are included in unconditional purchase obligations in the table above 
we do not believe other potential milestone obligations  some of which we consider to be of remote likelihood of ever being triggered  will have a material impact on our liquidity  capital resources or financial condition in the foreseeable future 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had a net domestic operating loss carryforward  or nol  of approximately million  a domestic alternative minimum tax credit of approximately thousand and a domestic research and development tax credit carryforward of approximately thousand for federal tax purposes 
our federal nol is scheduled to expire in various years beginning in and ending in  with the majority scheduled to expire in or later 
the nol and tax credit carryforwards are subject to alternative minimum tax limitations and to examination by the tax authorities 
in addition  we had a change of ownership as defined under the provisions of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended an ownership change 
we believe the latest ownership change occurred at the time of our initial public offering in july we do not believe this ownership change will place a significant restriction on our ability to utilize our nols in the future 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued asu  which amends asc topic  revenue recognition 
this guidance modifies the separation criteria by eliminating the criterion for objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered products or services 
instead  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet both of the following criteria i the delivered items have value to the customer on a standalone basis  and ii if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in control of the vendor 
this guidance eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation and requires  instead  that arrangement consideration be allocated  at the inception of the arrangement  to all deliverables based on their relative selling price ie  the relative selling price method 
when applying the relative selling price method  a hierarchy is used for estimating the selling price for each of the deliverables as follows i vendor specific objective evidence of the selling price  ii third party evidence of the selling price prices of the vendor s or any competitor s largely interchangeable products or services  in standalone sales to similarly situated customers  or iii best estimate of the selling price 
this guidance will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier application permitted 
we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for level reconciliation disclosures which are effective for annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and foreign interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
interest rate risk the interest payable on certain of our lines of credit and other borrowings is variable based on the united states prime rate and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   approximately million was outstanding on these lines of credit and other borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 
we also had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents at december   the majority of which was invested in liquid interest bearing accounts 
we had no interest rate hedge transactions in place on december  we completed an interest rate risk sensitivity analysis based on the above and an assumed one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates 
if market rates increase decrease by one percentage point  we would experience a decrease increase in annual interest expense of approximately thousand based on our outstanding balances as of december  foreign currency risk our investment in foreign assets consists primarily of our investment in our european subsidiary 
foreign currency risk may impact our results of operations 
in cases where we purchase inventory in one currency and sell corresponding products in another  our gross margin percentage is typically at risk based on foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  in cases where we may be generating operating income in foreign currencies  the magnitude of such operating income when translated into us dollars will be at risk based on foreign currency exchange rates 
our agreements with suppliers and customers vary significantly in regard to the existence and extent of currency adjustment and other currency risk sharing provisions 
we had no foreign currency hedge transactions in place on december  we have a wholly owned subsidiary in switzerland which uses the swiss franc as its functional currency 
we purchase inventory in foreign currencies  primarily japanese yen and euros  and sell corresponding products in us dollars 
we also sell products in foreign currencies  primarily japanese yen and euros  where our inventory costs are in us dollars 
based on our results of operations  if foreign currency exchange rates were to strengthen weaken by against the dollar  we would expect a resulting pre tax loss gain of approximately thousand
