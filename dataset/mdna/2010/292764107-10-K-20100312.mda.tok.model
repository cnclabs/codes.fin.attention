item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to the historical information  the discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements due to applications of our critical accounting policies and factors including  but not limited to  those set forth under the caption risk factors in item a of part i of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading provider of clean and intelligent energy solutions  which include demand response services  energy efficiency  or monitoring based commissioning  services  energy procurement services and emissions tracking and trading support services 
these solutions help optimize the balance of electric supply and demand  provide cost efficient alternatives to traditional power generation  transmission and distribution resources  and drive significant cost savings for our customers 
our customers are commercial  institutional and industrial end users of energy  as well as electric power grid operators and utilities 
we believe that we are the largest demand response service provider in the united states for commercial  institutional and industrial customers 
as of december   we managed over  mw of demand response capacity across an end use customer base of approximately  accounts and  customer sites throughout multiple electric power grids 
demand response is an alternative to traditional power generation and transmission infrastructure projects that enables grid operators and utilities to reduce the likelihood of service disruptions  such as brownouts and blackouts  during periods of peak electricity demand  and otherwise manage the electric power grid during short term imbalances of supply and demand 
we use our noc and powertrak enterprise software platform to remotely manage and reduce electricity consumption across a growing network of commercial  institutional and industrial customer sites  making demand response capacity available to grid operators and utilities on demand while helping end users of electricity achieve energy savings  environmental benefits and improved financial results 
to date  we have received substantially all of our revenues from grid operators and utilities  who make recurring payments to us for managing demand response capacity that we share with end users of electricity in exchange for such end users reducing their power consumption when called upon 
we build on our position as a leading demand response services provider by using our noc and scalable powertrak technology platform to sell additional energy management solutions to new and existing end use customers 
these additional solutions include our monitoring based commissioning services  energy procurement services and emissions tracking and trading support services 
our monitoring based commissioning services combine advanced metering  building management systems  and energy analytics software applications to identify energy efficiency opportunities in large buildings 
our energy procurement services provide our commercial  institutional and industrial customers located in restructured or deregulated markets throughout the united states with the ability to more effectively manage the energy supplier selection process  including energy supply product procurement and implementation 
our emissions tracking and trading support services include a comprehensive  software based accounting system for our commercial  institutional and industrial customers to effectively monitor  mitigate and monetize their greenhouse gas emissions in response to existing and pending greenhouse gas reporting requirements 
we continue to devote substantially all of our efforts toward the sale of our demand response and energy management solutions 
we have incurred net losses from inception to december  our 
table of contents net loss was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
significant recent developments in december  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of cogent  a company specializing in comprehensive energy consulting  engineering and building commissioning solutions to commercial  institutional and industrial customers 
the purchase price was equal to approximately million consisting of both cash and shares of our common stock 
by integrating cogent s extensive commissioning and engineering experience into our monitoring based commissioning energy efficiency application  we believe that we will be able to deliver even more value to our rapidly growing customer base 
in august  we completed an underwritten public offering of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an offering price of per share  which included the sale of  shares by certain selling stockholders 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the offering 
in july  we and neal c 
isaacson  our then current chief financial officer and treasurer  agreed that mr 
isaacson would resign as chief financial officer and treasurer effective as of the close of business on july  also in july  we entered into an employment offer letter to hire and retain timothy weller as our chief financial officer and treasurer 
mr 
weller s employment with us commenced on july  in june  we acquired substantially all of the assets of eq  a software company specializing in the development of enterprise sustainability management products and services  for a purchase price equal to approximately million consisting of both cash and shares of our common stock 
we believe that the acquisition of eq strengthens our position in a nascent yet growing market committed to helping energy and sustainability leaders plan their own response to reach energy efficiency and emissions goals 
revenues and expense components revenues we derive recurring revenues from the sale of our demand response and energy management solutions 
our revenues from our demand response services primarily consist of capacity and energy payments 
we derive revenues from demand response capacity that we make available in open market programs  which are open market bidding opportunities established by grid operators and utilities 
in these open market programs  grid operators and utilities generally seek bids from companies such as ours to provide demand response capacity based on prices offered in competitive bidding 
these opportunities are generally characterized by flexible capacity commitments and prices that vary by hour  day  month  bidding period or supplemental  new or modified programs 
in certain markets  we enter into long term capacity contracts with grid operators and utilities  generally ranging from three to years in duration  to deploy our demand response solutions 
our revenues have historically been higher in our second and third fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due to seasonal demand related to the demand response market 
where we operate in open market programs  our revenues from demand response capacity payments generally vary month to month based upon our enrolled capacity and the market payment rate 
where we have a long term contract  we receive periodic capacity payments  which may vary monthly or seasonally  based upon enrolled capacity and predetermined payment rates 
under both long term contracts and open market programs  we receive capacity payments regardless of whether we are called upon to reduce demand for electricity from the electric power grid and we recognize revenue 
table of contents over the applicable delivery period  even where payments are made over a different period 
we generally demonstrate our capacity either through a demand response event or a measurement and verification test 
this demonstrated capacity is typically used to calculate the continuing periodic capacity payments to be made to us until the next demand response event or test establishes a new demonstrated capacity amount 
in most cases  we also receive an additional payment for the amount of energy usage that we actually curtail from the grid during a demand response event  we call this an energy payment 
we do not recognize any revenues until we can determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and we deem collection to be reasonably assured 
as program rules may differ for each contract and or region where we operate  we assess whether or not we have met the specific service requirements under the program rules and recognize or defer revenues as necessary 
we recognize demand response revenues when we have provided verification to the grid operator or utility of our ability to deliver the committed capacity under the contract or open market program 
committed capacity is verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a measurement and verification test 
once the capacity amount has been verified  the revenues are recognized and future revenues become fixed or determinable and are recognized monthly over the performance period until the next verification event 
in subsequent verification events  if our verified capacity is below the previously verified amount  the grid operator or utility customer will reduce future payments based on the adjusted verified capacity amounts 
we defer incremental direct costs incurred related to the acquisition or origination of a contract or open market program in a transaction that results in the deferral or delay of revenue recognition 
as of december  and  the incremental direct costs deferred were approximately million and million  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  we deferred contract origination costs of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these deferred expenses would not have been incurred without our participation in a certain open market program and will be expensed in proportion to the related revenue being recognized 
in addition  we capitalize the costs of our production and generation equipment utilized in the delivery of our demand response services and expense such equipment over the lesser of its useful life or the term of the contractual arrangement 
these capitalized costs are included in property and equipment in our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that this accounting treatment appropriately matches expenses with the associated revenue 
as of december   we had over  mw under management in our demand response network  meaning that we had entered into definitive contracts with our commercial  institutional and industrial customers with respect to over  mw of demand response capacity 
we generally begin earning revenues from our mw under management within approximately one month from the date on which we enable the mw  or the date on which we can reduce the mw from the electricity grid if called upon to do so 
an exception is the pjm forward capacity market  which is a market in which we materially increased our participation beginning in the first quarter of and in which we expect to continue to increase our participation and derive revenues for the foreseeable future 
because pjm operates on a june to may program year basis  a mw that we enable after june of each year may not begin earning revenue until june of the following year 
this results in a longer average revenue recognition lag time in our end use customer portfolio from the point in time when we consider a mw to be under management to when we earn revenues from the mw 
certain other markets in which we currently participate or choose to participate in the future may operate in a manner similar to the pjm forward capacity market  which would create a delay in recognizing revenue from the mw that we enable in those markets 
our portfolio of additional energy management solutions includes our monitoring based commissioning services  energy procurement services  and emissions tracking and trading support services 
our monitoring based commissioning services combine advanced metering  building 
table of contents management systems  and energy analytics software applications to identify energy efficiency opportunities in large buildings 
our energy procurement services provides our end use customers located in restructured or deregulated markets throughout the united states with the ability to more effectively manage the energy supplier selection process  including energy supply product procurement and implementation 
we also use our carbontrak platform to deliver emissions tracking and trading support services  which include a comprehensive  software based accounting system for our commercial  institutional and industrial customers to enable them to more effectively monitor  mitigate and monetize their greenhouse gas emissions in response to existing and pending greenhouse gas reporting requirements 
we generally receive either a subscription based or consulting fee or a percentage savings fee for these energy management solutions 
revenues derived from our energy management solutions were million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and revenues generated from open market sales to pjm  a grid operator customer  accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues for the years ended december    and under certain contracts and programs  such as pjm s emergency load response program  or elrp  the period during which we are required to perform may be shorter than the period over which we receive payments under that contract or program 
in these cases  we record revenue over the mandatory performance obligation period  and a portion of the revenues that have been earned is recorded and accrued as unbilled revenue 
our unbilled revenue of million at december  will be billed and collected through may  our unbilled revenue of million as of december  was collected through may  revenues generated from two fixed price contracts with  and open market sales to  iso ne  a grid operator customer  accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues for the years ended december   and our two fixed price contracts with iso ne expired on may  in addition   and  respectively  of our total revenues for the years ended december   and were generated under a fixed price contract with the connecticut light and power company  or cl p  which expired on december  we have enrolled a significant portion of the mw represented by our expired fixed price contracts with iso ne and cl p in other available demand response programs 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for our demand response solutions consists primarily of payments that we make to our commercial  institutional and industrial customers for their participation in our demand response network 
we generally enter into three to five year contracts with our commercial  institutional and industrial customers under which we deliver recurring cash payments to them for the capacity they commit to make available on demand 
we also generally make an additional payment when a commercial  institutional or industrial customer reduces consumption of energy from the electric power grid 
the equipment and installation costs for our devices  which monitor energy usage  communicate with sites and  in certain instances  remotely control energy usage to achieve committed capacity  at our commercial  institutional and industrial customer sites are capitalized and depreciated over the lesser of the remaining estimated customer relationship period or the estimated useful life of the equipment  and this depreciation is reflected in cost of revenues 
we also include in cost of revenues the monthly telecommunications and data costs we incur as a result of being connected to commercial  institutional and industrial customer sites and our internal payroll and related costs allocated to a commercial  institutional and industrial customer site 
cost of revenues for energy management solutions include third party services  equipment depreciation and the wages and associated benefits that we pay to our project managers for the performance of their services 

table of contents gross profit and gross margin gross profit consists of our total revenues less our cost of revenues 
our gross profit has been  and will be  affected by many factors  including a the demand for our demand response and energy management solutions  b the selling price of our solutions  c our cost of revenues  d the way in which we manage our portfolio of demand response capacity  as described under the caption business industry background our market opportunity in item of part i of this annual report on form k  e the introduction of new clean and intelligent energy solutions  f our demand response event performance and g our ability to open and enter new markets and regions and expand deeper into markets we already serve 
our outcomes in negotiating favorable contracts with our commercial  institutional and industrial customers  as well as with our utility and grid operator customers  the effective management of our portfolio of demand response capacity and our demand response event performance are the primary determinants of our gross profit and gross margin 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of selling and marketing  general and administrative  and research and development expenses 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
we grew from full time employees at december  to full time employees at december  we expect to continue to hire employees to support our growth for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we incur significant up front costs associated with the expansion of the number of mw under our management  which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future 
although we expect our overall operating expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we grow our mw under management and further increase our headcount  we expect our overall annual operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of total annual revenues as we leverage our existing employee base and continue generating revenues from our mw under management 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  including costs associated with share based payment awards  b commissions  c travel  lodging and other out of pocket expenses  d marketing programs such as trade shows and e other related overhead 
commissions are recorded as an expense when earned by the employee 
we expect increases in selling and marketing expenses in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we further increase the number of sales professionals and  to a lesser extent  increase our marketing activities 
we expect annual selling and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of total annual revenues as we leverage our current sales and marketing personnel 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  including costs associated with share based payment awards  related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and operations organizations  b facilities expenses  c accounting and legal professional fees  d depreciation and amortization and e other related overhead 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we invest in infrastructure to support our continued growth 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total annual revenues as we leverage our current infrastructure and employee base 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  including costs associated with share based payment awards  related to our research and development organization  b payments to suppliers for design and consulting services  c costs relating to the 
table of contents design and development of new solutions and enhancement of existing solutions  d quality assurance and testing and e other related overhead 
during the years ended december   and  we capitalized internal software development costs of million  million and million  respectively  and the amount is included as software in property and equipment at december  we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future and to decrease as a percentage of total revenues in the long term as we leverage our existing technology and develop new technologies 
stock based compensation effective as of january   we adopted the requirements of accounting standards codification  or asc   stock compensation formerly financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
r  share based payments 
as such  all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  are recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values as of the date of grant 
we adopted asc using the modified prospective transition method  in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of asc for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of asc for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of asc that remain unvested on the effective date 
as a result  we are recognizing compensation for the fair value of the unvested portion of option grants issued prior to the adoption of asc  whose fair value was calculated utilizing a black scholes option pricing model 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method of asc  results for prior periods have not been restated 
for stock options granted prior to january   the fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model  and for stock options granted on or after january   the fair value of each award is and has been estimated on the date of grant using a trinomial valuation model 
if we had continued using the black scholes option pricing model in  stock based compensation expense would not have been materially different for the year ended december  for the years ended december   and  we recorded expenses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  in connection with share based payment awards to employees and non employees 
with respect to grants through december   a future expense of non vested options of approximately million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and a future expense of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards of approximately million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
other income and expense  net other income and expense consist primarily of interest income earned on cash balances  gain or loss on foreign currency transactions and other non operating income 
we historically have invested our cash in money market funds  treasury funds  commercial paper  municipal bonds and auction rate securities 
we do not currently hold any auction rate securities 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest and fees on the svb credit facility and fees associated with issuing letters of credit and other financial assurances

the increase in our demand response solutions revenues was offset by the expiration of our two fixed price contracts with iso ne and our fixed priced contract with cl p  as well as a reduction in energy payments due to lower real time demand response prices that affected our participation in certain economic demand response programs  including the day ahead program with iso ne 
for the year ended december   our energy management solutions revenues were flat compared to the year ended december  revenues related to our energy procurement services for the year ended december  increased approximately million compared to the same period in primarily due to a full year of recognized revenue related to our acquisition of src  which 
table of contents occurred in may this increase was offset by a million reduction in revenue related to the discontinuation of our energy efficiency audits  which we ceased conducting at the beginning of we currently expect our revenues to increase in compared to as we seek to further increase our mw under management in all operating regions  enroll new end use customers in our demand response programs  continue to sell our energy management solutions to our new and existing demand response customers and pursue more favorable pricing opportunities

this market feature creates a longer average revenue recognition lag time across our end use customer portfolio from the point in time when we consider a mw to be under management to when we earn revenues from that mw 
because we incur operational expenses  including salaries and related personnel costs  at the time of enablement  we believe there may be a trend of higher up front costs than we have incurred historically

we have provided these non gaap financial measures in addition to gaap financial results because we believe that these non gaap financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts in assessing our operating performance due to the following factors we believe that the presentation of non gaap measures that adjust for the impact of stock based compensation expenses and amortization expense related to acquisition related assets provides investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and  therefore  are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand our operating results and underlying operational trends  although stock based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives  stock based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of 
table of contents grant  then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock based instrument  and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant  and we do not acquire intangible assets on a predictable cycle 
our intangible assets relate solely to business acquisitions 
amortization costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition  are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition 
pursuant to the requirements of the sec  we have provided below a reconciliation of each non gaap financial measure used to the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap 
these measures may differ from the non gaap information  even where similarly titled  used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare our performance to that of other companies

as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling million  an increase of million from the december  balance of million 
we are contingently liable for million in connection with outstanding letters of credit under the svb credit facility 
as of december  and  we had restricted cash balances of million and million  respectively  which relate to amounts to 
table of contents collateralize unused outstanding letters of credit and cover financial assurance requirements in certain of the programs in which we participate 
as of december   we no longer have investments in marketable securities 
this is a result of a bond that matured in the second quarter of our holdings of marketable securities as of december  were million  of which million was invested in commercial paper and million was invested in government securities 
at december   our excess cash was primarily invested in money market funds 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents at december  and our anticipated net cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs  including investing activities  for at least the next months 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  without limitation  the rate at which we sell our demand response solutions to utilities and grid operators and the increasing rate at which letters of credit or security deposits are required by those utilities and grid operators  the introduction and market acceptance of new demand response and energy management solutions  the expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development activities  and the geographic expansion of our business operations 
to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents and our anticipated cash flows from operating activities  as well as the svb credit facility  are insufficient to fund our future activities or planned future acquisitions  we may be required to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements or public or private equity or debt financings 
we also may raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses  technologies or products 
in addition  we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
accordingly  we have filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to register shares of our common stock and other securities for sale  giving us the opportunity to raise funding when needed or otherwise considered appropriate at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of any such offerings 
we currently have the ability to sell approximately million of our securities under the shelf registration statement 
any equity or equity linked financing could be dilutive to existing stockholders 
in the event we require additional cash resources  we may not be able to obtain bank credit arrangements or effect any equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all

if a default occurs and is not cured within any applicable cure period or is not waived  our obligations under the svb credit facility may be accelerated 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the svb credit facility at december  and  as of that date  we had repaid the outstanding borrowings thereunder of million 
we continue to have an aggregate of million in letters of credit issued for our account under the svb credit facility

during the year ended december   we made scheduled payments on our outstanding debt and capital lease obligations of million and refinanced million of our debt through borrowings of million under the svb credit facility 
during the year ended december   we incurred an additional million of debt obligations and made scheduled payments on our outstanding debt and capital lease obligations of million 
contingent earn out payments in connection with our acquisition of cogent  we agreed to make a single contingent earn out payment equal to million in cash  to be paid  if at all  based on the business achieving certain performance targets from the date of acquisition on december  through december  this earn out payment  if any  will be payable upon the final measurement of the performance targets 
we believe that it is remote that this earn out payment will not be made 
as of december   we have recorded approximately million related to the contingent earn out payment as additional purchase price as this represents the fair value of the payment as of december  any changes to the fair value of this liability will be recorded within our consolidated statements of operations 
in connection with our acquisition of src  we incurred a contingent obligation to pay to the former holders of src membership interests an earn out amount equal to to of the revenues of src s business during each twelve month period from may  through april   which would be recognized as additional purchase price when earned 
the earn out payments are based on the achievement of certain minimum revenue based milestones of src and are paid in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
these additional earn out payments  if any  are recorded as additional purchase price 
the additional purchase price recorded in the second quarter of  which was related to the may  to april  earn out period  totaled approximately million  of which million was paid in cash during the second quarter of and the remainder of which was paid by the issuance of  shares of our common stock during the third quarter of the final earn out payment  if any  related to the may  through april  earn out period will be determined during the second quarter of capital spending we have made capital expenditures primarily for general corporate purposes to support our growth and for equipment installation related to our business

we are not aware of any events of default under the svb credit facility 
our capital lease obligation consists of a telephone system we lease for which we have a bargain purchase option at the end of the five year term 
our operating lease obligations relate primarily to the lease of our corporate headquarters in boston  massachusetts and our offices in new york  new york  san francisco and concord  california  baltimore  maryland and dallas  texas  as well as certain property and equipment 
as part of our acquisition of src  we may be obligated to pay the former holders of src membership interests an earn out amount equal to to of the revenues of src s business during each twelve month period from may  through april  the earn out payments  if any  will be based on the achievement of certain minimum revenue based milestones of src and will be paid in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
as part of our acquisition of cogent  we may be obligated to pay the former holders of cogent an earn out amount equal to million 
the earn out payment  if any  will be based on the achievement of a certain minimum revenue based milestone and a certain earnings based milestone of cogent for the year ended december  and will be paid in cash 
both of these milestones need to be achieved in order for the earn out payment to occur and there will be no partial payment if the milestones are not fully achieved 
in may  because we had no additional credit available under the svb credit facility  we entered into a credit arrangement with a third party in connection with bidding capacity into a certain open market bidding program 
the arrangement included an up front payment of million  and we will be required to pay the third party an additional contingent fee  up to a maximum of million  based on the revenue that we expect to earn and recognize in in connection with the bid

for information on these commitments and contingent obligations  see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in appendix a to this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuations and purchase price allocations related to business combinations  expected future cash flows including growth rates  discount rates  terminal values and other assumptions and estimates used to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill  amortization methods and periods  certain accrued expenses and other related charges  stock based compensation  contingent liabilities  tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in appendix a to this annual report on form k  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with asc  revenue recognition formerly staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in all of our arrangements  we do not recognize any revenues until we can determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and we deem collection to be reasonably assured 
in making these judgments  we evaluate these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider a definitive agreement signed by the customer and us or an arrangement enforceable under the rules of an open market bidding program to be representative of persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we consider delivery to have occurred when service has been delivered to the customer and no post delivery obligations exist 
in instances where customer acceptance is required  delivery is deemed to have occurred when customer acceptance has been achieved 
fees are fixed or determinable 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within normal payment terms 
if the fee is subject to refund or adjustment and we cannot reliably estimate this amount  we recognize revenues when the right to a refund or adjustment lapses 
if offered payment terms exceed our normal terms  we recognize revenues as the amounts become due and payable or upon the receipt of cash 
collection is reasonably assured 
we conduct a credit review at the inception of an arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is reasonably assured if  based 
table of contents upon our evaluation  we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  revenues are deferred and recognized upon the receipt of cash 
we enter into agreements and open market bidding programs to provide demand response solutions 
demand response revenues are earned based on our ability to deliver committed capacity 
energy event revenue  which reflects additional payments made to us for the amount of energy usage actually curtailed from the grid  is contingent revenue earned based upon the actual amount of energy provided during the demand response event 
we recognize demand response revenue when we have provided verification to the grid operator or utility of our ability to deliver the committed capacity which entitles us to payments under the contract or open market program 
committed capacity is generally verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a measurement and verification test 
once the capacity amount has been verified  the revenue is recognized and future revenue becomes fixed or determinable and is recognized monthly until the next demand response event or test 
in subsequent verification events  if our verified capacity is below the previously verified amount  the grid operator or utility customer will reduce future payments based on the adjusted verified capacity amounts 
ongoing demand response revenue recognized between demand response events or tests that are not subject to penalty or customer refund are recognized in revenue 
if the revenue is subject to refund and the amount of refund cannot be reliably estimated  the revenue is deferred until the right of refund lapses 
certain of the forward capacity programs in which we participate may be deemed derivative contracts under asc  derivatives and hedging formerly sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities 
in such situations  we believe we meet the scope exception under asc as a normal purchase  normal sale as that term is defined in asc and  accordingly  the arrangement is not treated as a derivative contract 
revenue from energy events is recognized when earned 
energy event revenue is deemed to be substantive and represents the culmination of a separate earnings process and is recognized when the energy event is initiated by the grid operator or utility customer 
as described above  grid operator or utility customer contracts or open market programs may include performance guarantees 
if we are unable to reliably estimate our ability to meet these guarantees  we do not recognize any revenue prior to the successful completion of the performance requirement 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors  including a dialogue with the customer to determine the cause of non payment  and evaluation of the customer s current financial situation 
in the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information present 
provisions for allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded in general and administrative expense 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and our assessment of the customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have not been significant to date and have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  for example as a result of the recent financial and economic turmoil or otherwise  resulting in an impairment of their 
table of contents ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was  business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we estimate the fair value of contingent consideration at the time of the acquisition using all pertinent information known to us at the time to assess the probability of payment of contingent amounts 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill 
we use the income approach to determine the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets  including customer contracts  customer relationships  non compete agreements and trade names 
this approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates and expected trends  including introductions by competitors of new services and products 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and market participant investment risk factors 
the use of different assumptions could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial condition and results of operations 
customer contracts represent contractual arrangements to provide ongoing services 
customer relationships represent established relationships with customers  which provide a ready channel for the sale of additional products and services 
non compete agreements represent arrangements with certain employees that limit or prevent their ability to take employment at a competitor for a fixed period of time 
tradenames represent acquired product names that we intend to continue to utilize 
impairment of intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows 
amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years 
we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
during the year ended december   as a result of a change in the expected period of economic benefit of the trade name acquired in the acquisition of cogent  we determined that an impairment indicator existed 
based on the analysis performed  we determined that this trade name was partially impaired and recorded an impairment charge of  during the year ended december   which is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the fair market value of approximately  
table of contents was determined using level inputs  as defined by asc  fair value measurements and disclosures formerly sfas no 
 fair value measurement  based on the projected future cash flows over the revised period of economic benefit discounted based on our weighted average cost of capital of 
goodwill in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other formerly fasb sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
we have determined that the reporting unit level is the entity level as discrete financial information is not available at a lower level and our chief operating decision maker  which is our chief executive officer and executive management team  collectively  make business decisions based on the evaluation of financial information at the entity level 
events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  current economic and market conditions  including a decline in market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors  business climate or operational performance of the business  and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
our annual impairment test date is november in performing the test  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under asc the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units  as defined  to the fair value of these units 
we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit  including an independent valuation to conduct this test 
the valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales or offerings of similar companies 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as the date of the impairment test on our weighted average cost of capital 
if the carrying value of its reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
we conducted our annual impairment test as of november  in order to complete the annual impairment test  we performed detailed analyses estimating the fair value of our reporting unit utilizing our fiscal forecast with updated long term growth assumptions 
as a result of completing the first step  the fair value exceeded the carrying value  and as such the second step of the impairment test was not required 
to date  we have not been required to perform the second step of the impairment test 
the fair value of the entity is determined by use of a market approach based on the quoted market price of our common stock and the number of shares outstanding and a discounted cash flow analysis  or the dcf  under the income approach 
the key assumptions that drive the fair value in the dcf model are the discount rates ie  weighted average cost of capital  or wacc  terminal values  growth rates  and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
if the current worldwide financial markets and economic environment were to deteriorate  this would likely result in a higher wacc because market participants would require a higher rate of return 
in the dcf  as the wacc increases  the fair value decreases 
the other significant factor in the dcf is our projected financial information ie  amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates and if our assumptions were to be adversely impacted  this could result in a reduction of the fair value of the entity 
we believe that we are not at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
the annual impairment testing process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 

table of contents if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
impairment of property and equipment we review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment is recognized in earnings and equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
if these assets are not impaired  but their useful lives have decreased  the remaining net book value is amortized over the revised useful life 
for the year ended december   the carrying value of a portion of our demand response and generation equipment exceeded the undiscounted future cash flows based upon their anticipated retirement dates 
as a result  we recognized an impairment charge of million representing the difference between the carrying value and fair market value of demand response equipment and generation equipment  which is included in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the fair market value of approximately million was determined utilizing level inputs  as defined by asc  based on the projected future cash flows discounted using the estimated market participant rate of return for this type of asset 
we recognized an impairment charge of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  which is included in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   approximately million of our generation equipment is enrolled in open market demand response programs 
the recoverability of this generation equipments carrying value is largely dependent on the rates that we are compensated for our committed capacity within these programs 
these rates represent market rates and can fluctuate based on the supply and demand of capacity 
although  these market rates are established up to three years in advance of the service delivery  these market rates have not yet been established for the entire remaining useful life of this generation equipment 
in performing its impairment analysis  we estimate the expected future market rates based on current existing market rates and trends 
a decline in the expected future market rates of greater than could result in an impairment charge related to this generation equipment 
software development costs we capitalize eligible costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use 
we capitalize the payroll and payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the development of internal use computer software 
we amortize these costs on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software  which is generally two to three years 
our judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value and impairment of the capitalized costs  and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized 
software development costs of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  have been capitalized 
stock based compensation effective as of january   we adopted the requirements of asc as such  all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  are recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values as of the date of grant 
we adopted asc using the modified prospective transition method  in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of asc for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of asc for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of asc that remain unvested on the 
table of contents effective date 
as a result  we are recognizing compensation for the fair value of the unvested portion of option grants issued prior to the adoption of asc  whose fair value was calculated utilizing a black scholes option pricing model 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method of asc  results for prior periods have not been restated 
for stock options granted prior to january   the fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model  and for stock options granted on or after january   the fair value of each award is and has been estimated on the date of grant using a trinomial valuation model 
if we had continued using the black scholes option pricing model in  stock based compensation expense would not have been materially different for the year ended december  as there was no public market for our common stock prior to the effective date of our ipo  we determined the volatility for options granted in  and based on an analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies that issued options with substantially similar terms 
the expected volatility of options granted has been determined using an average of the historical volatility measures of this peer group  as well as the historical volatility of our common stock beginning january  the expected volatility for options granted during was 
the risk free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
for  the weighted average risk free interest rate used was 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock and are contractually precluded from doing so under the svb credit facility  therefore  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
we have determined a forfeiture rate of as of december  ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded expenses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  in connection with share based payment awards to employees and non employees 
with respect to grants through december   a future expense of non vested options of approximately million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and a future expense of restricted stock and restricted stock units of approximately million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
for awards with graded vesting  we allocate compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
accordingly  we amortized the fair value of each option over each option s service period  which is generally the vesting period 
our accounting for stock options issued to non employees requires valuing and remeasuring such stock options to the current fair value until the performance date has been reached 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between financial reporting and taxes bases of our assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse 
we have incurred consolidated net losses since our inception and as a result  we have not recognized net united states deferred taxes as of december  or december  our deferred tax liabilities primarily relate to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and property and equipment 
our deferred tax assets relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards  accruals 
table of contents and reserves  and stock based compensation 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
in accordance with asc  income taxes  we are required to evaluate uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements formerly fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
asc also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition and defines the criteria that must be met for the benefits of a tax position to be recognized 
we had no gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december  and in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in our opinion  it is not required that we have a provision for income taxes for any years subject to audit 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
in the event our assumptions are incorrect  the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb ratified asc update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu asu amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently within the scope of asc subtopic previously included within eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf 
this consensus provides for two significant changes to the existing multiple element revenue recognition guidance 
first  this guidance deletes the requirement to have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for undelivered elements in an arrangement and will result in more deliverables being treated as separate units of accounting 
the second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables 
these changes may result in entities recognizing more revenue up front  and entities will no longer be able to apply the residual method and defer the fair value of undelivered elements 
upon adoption of these new rules  each separate unit of accounting must have a selling price  which can be based on management s estimate when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item  and the arrangement consideration is allocated based on the elements relative selling price 
this accounting guidance is effective no later than fiscal years beginning on or after june  but may be adopted early as of the first quarter of an entity s fiscal year 
entities may elect to adopt this accounting guidance either through prospective application to all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption or through a retrospective application to all revenue arrangements for all periods presented in the financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this revised accounting guidance  including the period in which we will adopt this guidance 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff positions  or fsp  fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairment  or fsp codified within asc  investments debt and equity securities 
fsp amends the requirements for the 
table of contents recognition and measurement of other than temporary impairments for debt securities by modifying the pre existing intent and ability indicator 
under this fsp  an other than temporary impairment is triggered when there is an intent to sell the security  it is more likely than not that the security will be required to be sold before recovery  or the security is not expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
additionally  this fsp changes the presentation of an other than temporary impairment in the income statement for those impairments involving credit losses 
the credit loss component will be recognized in earnings and the remainder of the impairment will be recorded in other comprehensive income 
fsp was effective for us beginning with the second quarter of fiscal the adoption of this fsp did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asc  business combinations formerly sfas no 
revised  business combinations  or sfas r 
sfas r retains the fundamental requirements in sfas that the acquisition method of accounting  which sfas referred to as the purchase method  be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
asc requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions specified in sfas r 
asc replaces sfas s cost allocation process  which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
sfas r retains the guidance in sfas for identifying and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill 
asc will now require acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally to affect income tax expense 
asc applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   which was our fiscal year 
early adoption is prohibited 
the adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements

 determination of the useful life of intangible assets codified within asc  intangibles goodwill and other  which amends the factors that must be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life over which to amortize the cost of a recognized intangible asset under asc the objective of this fsp is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under asc and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under asc the fsp is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   which was the beginning of fiscal for us 
the adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles codified within asc  generally accepted accounting principles  which establishes the fasb asc as the single source of authoritative accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we refer to this as the codification 
the codification will supersede all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
as a result  upon adoption  all references to accounting literature in our sec filings will conform to the appropriate reference within the codification 
the adoption of the codification did not have any impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in may  asc  subsequent events formerly sfas no 
 subsequent events  was issued and was amended in february asc does not require significant changes regarding recognition or disclosure of subsequent events 
asc is effective for financial statements issued after june  the implementation of asc did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
subsequent events have been evaluated for disclosure and recognition
