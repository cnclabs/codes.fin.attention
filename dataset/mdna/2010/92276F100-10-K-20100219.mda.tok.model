item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of ventas  inc together with its subsidiaries  unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires  we  us or our 
you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
this management s discussion and analysis will help you understand our corporate and operating environment  highlights and other recent developments  our critical accounting policies and estimates  our results of operations for the last three years  asset and liability management  our liquidity and capital resources  our cash flows  and contractual obligations 
corporate and operating environment we are a real estate investment trust reit with a geographically diverse portfolio of seniors housing and healthcare properties in the united states and canada 
as of december   this portfolio consisted of assets seniors housing communities  skilled nursing facilities  hospitals and medical office buildings mobs and other properties in states and two canadian provinces 
with the exception of our seniors housing communities that are managed by sunrise senior living  inc together with its subsidiaries  sunrise pursuant to long term management agreements and the majority of our mobs  we lease our properties to healthcare operating companies under triple net or absolute net leases  which require the tenants to pay all property related expenses 
we also had real estate loan investments relating to seniors housing and healthcare companies or properties as of december  our primary business consists of acquiring  financing and owning seniors housing and healthcare properties and leasing those properties to third parties or operating those properties through independent third party managers 
we operate through two reportable business segments triple net leased properties and senior living operations 
as of december   we had a ownership interest in of our properties 
we had to interests in seniors housing communities owned in joint ventures with sunrise  and we had controlling interests in six mobs owned through joint ventures with partners who provide management and leasing services for the properties 
our business strategy is comprised of three principal objectives portfolio diversification  stable earnings and growth  and maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity 
access to external capital is an important component of the success of our strategy as it impacts our ability to repay existing indebtedness as it matures and to make future investments 
our cost of and ability to access capital depend on various factors  including general market conditions  interest rates  credit ratings on our securities  perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our common stock 
generally  we attempt to match the long term duration of most of our investments with long term fixed rate financing 
at december   only of our consolidated debt was variable rate debt

index to financial statements as of december   our senior unsecured debt securities were rated bbb stable by standard poor s ratings services s p  bbb stable by fitch ratings and ba stable by moody s investors service moody s 
on february   moody s upgraded the rating on our unsecured debt securities to baa stable  giving us a third investment grade rating 
to the extent it is reasonable to do so  and we believe it to be in the best interests of our stakeholders  we intend to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt securities and to manage various capital ratios and amounts within appropriate parameters 
highlights and other recent developments liquidity and balance sheet following the upgrade by moody s on february   our unsecured debt securities now have investment grade ratings from all three nationally recognized ratings agencies 
we extended and amended the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities from to additionally  we increased our aggregate borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facilities to billion  of which million matures on april  and million matures on april  we issued and sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering for aggregate proceeds of million 
we issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due  at a discount to par value  for total proceeds of million  before the underwriting discount and expenses 
we purchased in open market transactions and or through cash tender offers million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due   and we recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of million related to these transactions 
we repaid in full  at par  million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due  and our mortgage debt obligations decreased by million during  including normal periodic principal amortization of million and debt transfers of million related to asset dispositions 
we obtained first mortgage loans aggregating million principal amount  secured by eighteen of our seniors housing communities with a weighted average fixed interest rate of per annum 
investments we purchased four mobs for an aggregate purchase price of million  increasing our mob investments to over million square feet 
we own one of these mobs through a joint venture with a partner that provides management and leasing services for the property 
we purchased one skilled nursing facility for million and leased it to brookdale senior living inc together with its subsidiaries  brookdale senior living 
we completed the development of two mobs pursuant to an arrangement we entered into with a nationally recognized private developer of mobs and healthcare facilities in that arrangement gave us the exclusive right  as part of a joint venture  to develop up to ten identified mobs on hospital campuses in eight states 
as of december   we had invested approximately million in two mobs under the arrangement 
dispositions we sold five seniors housing communities  one hospital  one mob and one other property to the existing tenants for an aggregate sales price before expenses of million and transferred related debt of million 
we recognized a net gain from the sales of these assets of million

index to financial statements we sold six skilled nursing facilities to kindred healthcare  inc together with its subsidiaries  kindred for total consideration of million and recognized a gain from the sale of these assets of million 
other we were included in the s p index  widely regarded as the best single gauge of the large cap us equities market 
it includes leading companies in leading industries of the us economy 
kindred extended  from the renewal date of april  through april   the lease term for assets one of which we subsequently sold that it leases from us 
at december   annual cash rent on the remaining assets was approximately million 
we received a favorable jury verdict of million in our litigation against hcp  inc hcp due to hcp s interference with our acquisition of sunrise senior living real estate investment trust sunrise reit in critical accounting policies and estimates on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb launched the accounting standards codification asc  which changes us generally accepted accounting principles gaap from a standards based model to a topical based model 
the topics are organized by asc number and are updated with an accounting standards update 
the asc is the single source of nongovernmental authoritative gaap for interim and annual periods ending after september  our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with gaap set forth in the asc  as published by the fasb 
gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base these estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different  it is possible that different accounting treatment would have been applied  resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
from time to time  we re evaluate our estimates and assumptions  and in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the critical accounting policies described below  among others  affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
for more information regarding our critical accounting policies  see note accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control 
all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation  and net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 
we apply fasb guidance for arrangements with variable interest entities vies  which requires the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and the determination of which a business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the vie 
we consolidate investments in vies when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie 
we must make judgments regarding our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie 
in making those judgments  we consider various factors  including the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements form of our ownership interest  our representation on the entity s governing body  the size and seniority of our investment  various cash flow scenarios related to the vie  our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture  if applicable 
our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity and determine the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements 
in the future  our assumptions may change  which could result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 
long lived assets and intangibles investments in real estate assets are recorded at cost 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method and allocate the cost of the properties acquired among tangible and recognized intangible assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date 
recognized intangibles include the value of acquired lease contracts  management agreements and related customer relationships 
our method for allocating the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate requires us to make subjective assessments for determining fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired or assumed 
this includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land and improvements  ground leases  tenant improvements  in place tenant leases  above and or below market leases  other intangibles embedded in contracts and any debt assumed 
each of these estimates requires significant judgment  and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations  as amounts allocated to some assets and liabilities have different depreciation or amortization lives 
additionally  the amortization of value assigned to above and or below market leases is recorded as a component of revenue  as compared to the amortization of in place leases and other intangibles  which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of income 
we estimate the fair value of buildings on an as if vacant basis and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building 
we determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over their estimated remaining useful lives 
we determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset or on internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio 
the fair value of in place leases  if any  reflects i the estimated value of any above and or below market leases  determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in place rentals  the resulting intangible asset or liability of which is amortized to revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods  if applicable  ii the estimated value of the cost to obtain tenants  including tenant allowances  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease  and iii an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease up period  as if the acquired space was vacant  which is also amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease 
we estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality  expectations of lease renewals with the tenant  and the potential for significant  additional future leasing arrangements with the tenant and amortize that value over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases  which includes the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected renewal periods 
we calculate the fair value of long term debt by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings  which is approximated based on the rate we estimate we would incur to replace each instrument on the date of acquisition 
any fair value adjustments related to long term debt are recognized as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate our long lived assets  primarily consisting of our investments in real estate  for impairment indicators 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related real 
table of contents 
index to financial statements estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations  and we adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows including sales proceeds is less than book value 
an impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such determination 
future events could occur that would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
business combinations for our acquisitions  we measure the assets acquired  liabilities assumed including contingencies and any noncontrolling interests at their fair values on the acquisition date 
our acquisition related transaction costs are included in merger related expenses and deal costs on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  prior to january   these costs were capitalized as part of the asset value at the time of the acquisition  as required by fasb guidance at that time 
loans receivable loans receivable are stated at the unpaid principal balance net of any deferred origination fees  purchase discounts or premiums and or valuation allowances 
net deferred origination fees  which are comprised of loan fees collected from the borrower net of certain direct costs  and purchase discounts or premiums are amortized to income over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method 
we evaluate the collectibility of loans and other amounts receivable from third parties based on a number of factors  including i corporate and facility level financial and operational reports  ii compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the applicable loan or lease agreement  iii the financial stability of the borrower or tenant and any guarantor  iv the payment history of the borrower or tenant  and v current economic conditions 
our level of reserves  if any  for loans and other amounts receivable from third parties fluctuates depending upon all of these factors 
fair value we follow fasb guidance that defines fair value and provides direction for measuring fair value and providing the necessary disclosures 
the guidance emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement and should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels one and two of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level three of the hierarchy 
level one inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access 
level two inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level one that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level two inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  other than quoted prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level three inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  which are typically based on the reporting entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
additionally  if an entity determines there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability in relation to the normal market activity for such asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities  then transactions or quoted prices may not accurately reflect fair value 
in addition  if there is evidence that the transaction for the asset or liability is not orderly  the entity shall place little  if any  weight on that transaction price as an indicator of fair value 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we record marketable debt and equity securities as available for sale and classify them as a component of other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
these securities are recorded at fair market value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
interest income  including discount or premium amortization  on marketable debt securities and gains or losses on securities sold  which are based on the specific identification method  are reported in income from loans and investments on our consolidated statements of income 
we determined the valuation of our current investments in marketable securities using level one inputs 
additionally  we determined the valuation allowance for loan losses based on level three inputs 
see note loans receivable of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we also follow fasb guidance relating to the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  which requires entities to separate an other than temporary impairment of a fixed maturity security into two components when i there are credit losses associated with the security that management asserts that it does not have an intent to sell and ii it is more likely than not that the entity will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings  and the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to other factors is recorded in other comprehensive loss 
we have not recognized any other than temporary impairment 
revenue recognition certain of our leases  including the majority of our leases with brookdale senior living  provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent 
base rental revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease 
income on our straight line revenue is recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured  and in the event we determine that collectibility of straight line revenue is not reasonably assured  we establish an allowance for estimated losses 
recognizing rental income on a straight line basis results in recognized revenue exceeding cash amounts contractually due from our tenants during the first half of the term for leases that have straight line treatment 
our master lease agreements with kindred the kindred master leases and certain of our other leases provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other substantive contingencies are met 
we recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if the revenue parameters or other substantive contingencies are met  rather than on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease 
we recognize income from rent  lease termination fees and all other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with securities and exchange commission the commission staff accounting bulletin i the agreement has been fully executed and delivered  ii services have been rendered  iii the amount is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize resident fees and services  other than move in fees  monthly as services are provided 
move in fees  which are a component of resident fees and services  are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease agreement 
lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with days notice 
federal income tax since we have elected to be treated as a reit under the applicable provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  prior to our acquisition of the assets of sunrise reit in april we made no provision for federal income tax purposes 
as a result of the sunrise reit acquisition  however  we now record income tax expense or benefit with respect to certain of our entities which are taxed as taxable reit subsidiaries under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations and not under the reit provisions 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
an increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances  and which causes a change in our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events  would be included in the tax provision when the changes in circumstances and our judgment occurs 
deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances  and which causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset  would be included in the tax provision when the changes in circumstances and our judgment occurs 
recently adopted accounting standards on january   we adopted fasb guidance related to variable interest accounting 
the guidance requires an enterprise to analyze whether its variable interest gives it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and ii the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the entity 
the guidance requires an enterprise to perform this analysis on an ongoing basis and requires additional disclosures about an enterprise s involvement in vies 
we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will impact our consolidated financial statements

routine capital expenditures normalized fad historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values  instead  have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
to overcome this problem  we consider ffo and normalized ffo and funds available for distribution fad appropriate measures of performance of an equity reit  and we use the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo 
nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property  plus real estate depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we define normalized ffo as ffo excluding a gains and losses on the sales of assets  including marketable securities  b merger related costs and expenses and deal costs and expenses  including expenses relating to our lawsuit against hcp and the issuance of preferred stock or bridge loan fees  c the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances  the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees  or additional costs  expenses  discounts or premiums incurred as a result of

ffo and normalized ffo and fad presented herein are not necessarily comparable to ffo and normalized ffo and fad presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions 
ffo and normalized ffo and fad should not be considered as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with gaap as indicators of our financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as measures of our liquidity  nor are ffo and normalized ffo and fad necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  ffo and normalized ffo and fad should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
asset liability management asset liability management is a key element of our overall risk management program 
the objective of asset liability management is to support the achievement of our business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels 
the asset liability management process focuses on a variety of risks  including market risk primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk and credit risk 
effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of our ffo and net worth 
the following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
market risk we are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates on borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities  certain of our mortgage loans that are floating rate obligations and mortgage loans receivable 
these market risks result primarily from changes in us or canadian libor rates  the canadian bankers acceptance rate or the us or canadian prime rates 
we continuously monitor our level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including our assessment of the current and future economic environment 
interest rate fluctuations generally do not affect our fixed rate debt obligations until such instruments mature 
however  changes in interest rates will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments 
if interest rates have risen at the time our fixed rate debt matures or at the time we refinance such debt  our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by the additional cost of borrowings 
conversely  lower interest rates at the time our debt matures or at the time of refinancing may lower our overall borrowing costs

index to financial statements to highlight the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates  the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of basis points bps in interest rates as of december  and as of december  in thousands gross book value fair value fair value reflecting change in interest rates bps bps the change in fair value of fixed rate debt was due primarily to debt repayments and overall changes in interest rates  partially offset by additional borrowings 
the table below sets forth certain information with respect to our debt  excluding premiums and discounts as of december  dollars in thousands balance fixed rate variable rate total percent of total debt fixed rate variable rate total weighted average interest rate at end of period fixed rate variable rate total weighted average rate the decrease in our outstanding variable rate debt from december  is primarily attributable to payments on our unsecured revolving credit facilities and certain repayments on our variable rate mortgage debt 
pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants  if interest rates increase on certain debt that we have totaling million as of december   our tenant is required to pay us additional rent on a dollar for dollar basis in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from the increased interest rates 
therefore  the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the tenant 
assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate debt  and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of december   interest expense for would increase and our net income would decrease by approximately million  or per common share on a diluted basis 
the fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which we could obtain similar borrowings 
we have investments in marketable debt securities on which we earn interest on a fixed or floating rate basis 
we record these investments as available for sale at fair market value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of stockholders equity 
interest rate fluctuations and market conditions will cause the fair market value of these investments to change 
as of december   the fair market value of our marketable debt securities  which had an original cost of million  was million 

table of contents 
index to financial statements as of december   the fair value of our loans receivable was million and was based on our estimates of currently prevailing rates for comparable loans 
see note loans receivable and note fair value of financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we are also subject to fluctuations in us and canadian exchange rates which may  from time to time  have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar will impact the amount of net income we earn from our canadian operations 
based on results  if the canadian dollar exchange rate were to increase or decrease by  our net income would decrease or increase  as applicable  by approximately million per year 
if we increase our international presence through investments in  and or acquisitions or development of  seniors housing and or healthcare assets outside the united states  we may also decide to transact additional business in currencies other than us or canadian dollars 
although we may decide to pursue hedging alternatives including additional borrowings in local currencies to protect against foreign currency fluctuations  we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity  on our ability to service our indebtedness and on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders  as required for us to continue to qualify as a reit a material adverse effect 
credit risk we derive a significant portion of our revenue by leasing our assets under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators  subject to certain limitations 
some of our triple net lease escalators are tied to the consumer price index  with caps  floors or collars 
we also earn revenue from residents at our seniors housing communities managed by sunrise and tenants in our mobs 
for the year ended december   of our ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization was derived from our senior living operations and mobs  where rental rates may fluctuate upon lease rollovers and renewals due to economic or market conditions 
for the years ended december  and  kindred accounted for million  or  of our total revenues and of our total noi net operating income including amounts in discontinued operations  and million  or  of our total revenues and of our total noi including amounts in discontinued operations  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  brookdale senior living accounted for million  or  of our total revenues and of our total noi including amounts in discontinued operations  and million  or  of our total revenues and of our total noi including amounts in discontinued operations  respectively 
this concentration of rental revenues and noi creates credit risk 
as a result  kindred s and brookdale senior living s financial condition and ability to meet their rental payments and other obligations to us has a significant impact on our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
any failure by kindred or brookdale senior living to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities  which could also affect its ability to pay rent to us 
see risk factors risks arising from our business we depend on kindred and brookdale senior living for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income  any inability or unwillingness of kindred or brookdale senior living to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on us included in part i  item a of this annual report on form k and note concentration of credit risk of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we regularly monitor the credit risk under our lease agreements with our tenants by  among other things  i reviewing and analyzing information regarding the healthcare industry generally  publicly available information regarding tenants  and information provided by the tenants and borrowers under our lease and other agreements  and ii having periodic discussions with tenants  borrowers and their representatives

we are party to management agreements with sunrise pursuant to which sunrise currently provides comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to of our seniors housing communities 
each management agreement has a term of years from its effective date  the earliest of which began in pursuant to the management agreements  we pay sunrise a base management fee of of resident fees and similar revenues  subject to reduction based on below target performance relating to noi for a pool of properties 
the minimum management fee assessable under these agreements is of resident fees and similar revenues of the properties 
we also pay incentive fees if a pool of properties exceeds aggregate performance targets relating to noi  provided  however  that total management fees  including incentive fees  shall not exceed of resident fees and similar revenues 
in  we paid a management fee for properties and management fees of between and for three properties 
the management agreements also specify that we or the joint venture to which we are party  as applicable will reimburse sunrise for direct or indirect costs necessary to manage our seniors housing communities 
we may terminate our management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof including  in certain circumstances  the revocation of any licenses or certificates necessary for operation  subject in each case to sunrise s rights to cure deficiencies 
each management agreement may also be terminated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to sunrise 
in addition  if a minimum number of properties fail to achieve a targeted noi level for a given period  then we may terminate the management agreement on each property in such underperforming pool 
this targeted noi level for each property is based upon an expected operating income projection set at the commencement of the management agreement for the applicable property  with such projection escalating annually 
however  various legal and contractual considerations may limit or delay our exercise of any or all of these termination rights 
as of december   we had to interests in seniors housing communities owned in joint ventures with sunrise  who only has protective rights related to major business decisions 
each of these joint ventures is managed by a board of managers or a general partner  each of which we control 
as the controlling member or partner  as the case may be  we have sole authority to make all decisions for our sunrise joint ventures  except for a limited set of major decisions  which generally include the merger or disposition of substantially all the assets of the joint venture  the sale of additional interests in the joint venture  the dissolution of the joint venture  the disposition of a property owned by the joint venture  and the acquisition of any real property 
we can generally transfer our interest in a sunrise joint venture  without consent  to anyone other than large seniors housing operators or their majority investors 
however  sunrise must obtain our prior consent for any direct or indirect transfer of its noncontrolling interest 
with limited exceptions  profits and losses of the joint ventures are allocated on a pro rata basis in accordance with the ownership interests 
if either member fails to make a required capital contribution to a joint venture after notice and a cure period  the non defaulting member may i revoke the capital contribution funding notice  ii advance to the joint venture the amount of the required capital contribution on behalf of the defaulting member in the form of a loan to the defaulting member  with all of the defaulting member s subsequent distributions being applied to the loan until repayment in full  or iii advance the capital on behalf of the defaulting member with a recalculation of each member s proportionate interest in the joint venture pursuant to the applicable formula in the agreements 
many of our sunrise joint venture agreements provide for a punitive reduction in the defaulting member s proportionate interest in the event of an advance of capital by a non defaulting member pursuant to option iii 
the joint ventures are generally limited to incurring new or refinanced mortgage indebtedness in excess of of the market value of its properties

liquidity and capital resources during  our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from issuances of debt and equity securities  debt financings  sales of assets and cash flows from operations

index to financial statements we expect that reit taxable income will be less than cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non cash deductions in computing reit taxable income 
although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the distribution requirement  it is possible that  from time to time  we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation

with respect to our mobs and our senior living communities managed by sunrise  we expect that capital expenditures will be funded by the cash flows from the properties or through additional borrowings 
to the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required  our liquidity may be affected adversely 
our ability to borrow funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes
