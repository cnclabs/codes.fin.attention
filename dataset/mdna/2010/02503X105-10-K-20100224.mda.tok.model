item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in millions  except per share data management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is designed to provide a reader of american capital agency corp 
financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management 
our md a is presented in five sections executive overview financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources forward looking statements executive overview we are a reit that invests exclusively in residential mortgage pass through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations on a leveraged basis 
these investments consist of securities for which principal and interest are guaranteed by government sponsored entities such as fannie mae and freddie mac  or by a us government agency such as ginnie mae 
we refer to these types of securities as agency securities and the specific agency securities in which we invest as our investment portfolio 
we were organized on january   and commenced operations on may  following the completion of our ipo 
in connection with the ipo  we sold ten million shares of our common stock at per share for net proceeds of million  net of the underwriters commission and other offering expenses 
concurrent with our ipo  american capital purchased five million shares of our common stock in a private placement at per share for aggregate proceeds of million 
in july  through a public secondary offering  american capital sold million shares of our common stock that it had purchased in the private placement 
in  we completed two follow on public offerings of a total of million shares of our common stock for proceeds  net of the underwriters discount and other offering costs  of approximately million 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol agnc 
we are externally managed by american capital agency management  llc our manager 
our manager is a wholly owned subsidiary of american capital  llc  which is a wholly owned portfolio company of american capital 
we do not have any employees 
our principal objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders through regular quarterly dividends from our net interest income  which is the spread between the interest income earned on our investment portfolio and the interest costs of our borrowings and hedging activities  and realized gains on our investments 
we fund our investments through short term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements 
since our ipo  we have declared or paid dividends of per share 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  commencing with our taxable year ending december  as long as we qualify as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our taxable income to stockholders 
as of december  and  we had total assets of billion and billion  respectively 
our investment portfolio of billion at fair value  as of december   consisted of billion of fixed rate agency securities  billion of adjustable rate agency securities and billion of collateralized mortgage obligations cmos backed by fixed and adjustable rate agency securities 
our investment portfolio of billion at fair value  as of december   consisted entirely of fixed rate agency securities 
our repurchase 
table of contents agreements outstanding were billion and billion and our stockholders equity was billion and billion  or per share and per share  for a leverage ratio  including the net liability for unsettled agency securities  of times and times our stockholders equity as of december  and  respectively 
we reported net income of million and million  or and per basic and diluted share for the year ended december  and the period from may  through december   respectively 
we have declared cumulative dividends of and per share through december  and  respectively 
recent developments on february   freddie mac announced that it will purchase  from the company s related fixed rate and adjustable rate arm mortgage participation certificate pc securities  substantially all mortgage loans that are days or more delinquent and fannie mae announced that it intends to increase significantly its purchases of delinquent loans from single family mbs trusts 
freddie mac will purchase substantially all of the delinquent loans in february fannie mae will begin to purchase delinquent loans in march and expects to purchase a significant portion of their current delinquent population within a few month period  subject to market  servicer capacity and other constraints 
these actions are collectively referred to herein as the gse buyouts 
the gse buyouts will have the effect of substantially increasing the prepayment speeds of the subject fannie mae and freddie mac mortgage backed securities until the purchases are complete 
the exact impact is difficult to determine and may not be uniform  even among securities with similar mortgage pool characteristics 
nevertheless  we believe that certain characteristics render a mortgage pool particularly susceptible to having seriously delinquent mortgages subject to the gse buyouts and that prepayment speed increases will be disproportionally concentrated in securities backed by mortgage pools with these characteristics 
these characteristics include having higher coupon or interest only mortgages or having mortgages that were originated during certain periods of high home price appreciation  which were followed by periods of decline 
the effective yield of securities purchased at premiums or discounts is based on the anticipated prepayments over the life of the security 
therefore  short term increases or decreases in prepayment speeds may or may not impact the effective yield of securities purchased at premiums or discounts 
however  securities that prepay more quickly  regardless of the source of the prepayment  may experience an increase in the frequency and magnitude of margin calls under repurchase agreements because there will likely be a significant time lag between when the prepayment is reported which reduces the market value of the security and when the principal payment is actually received 
additionally  faster prepayment speeds on securities with market values above par may negatively impact the net asset value of those securities because the holder will receive a prepayment at par  but the net asset value will likely have been at a premium to par 
for a discussion of our strategy to mitigate the risk of a potential increase in gse buyout activity please refer to sections our asset management strategy and the results of operations for the year ended december  below 
our investment strategy our investment strategy is to manage an investment portfolio consisting exclusively of agency securities that seeks to generate attractive  risk adjusted returns 
our manager has established an investment committee comprised of certain of its officers 
the investment committee has established investment guidelines  certain of which have been approved by our board of directors 
the investment committee can change those investment guidelines at any time with the approval of our board of directors 
the following are our investment guidelines approved by our board of directors no investment shall be made in any non agency securities  no investment shall be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  
table of contents no investment shall be made that would cause us to be regulated as an investment company under the investment company act  and prior to entering into any proposed investment transaction with american capital or any of its affiliates  a majority of our independent directors must approve the terms of the transaction 
in february  our board of directors approved the removal of a guideline that limited our leverage to not greater than times our stockholders equity as computed in accordance with gaap 
agency securities consist of residential pass through certificates and collateralized mortgage obligations for which the principal and interest are guaranteed by a us government agency or a us government sponsored entity 
residential pass through certificates 
residential pass through certificates are securities representing interests in pools of mortgage loans secured by residential real property where payments of both interest and principal  plus pre paid principal  on the securities are made monthly to holders of the securities  in effect passing through monthly payments made by the individual borrowers on the mortgage loans that underlie the securities  net of fees paid to the issuer guarantor and servicers of the securities 
holders of the securities also receive guarantor advances of principal and interest for delinquent loans in the mortgage pools 
collateralized mortgage obligations 
cmos are structured instruments representing interests in residential pass through certificates 
cmos consist of multiple classes of securities  with each class having specified characteristics  including stated maturity dates  weighted average lives and rules governing principal and interest distribution 
monthly payments of interest and principal  including prepayments  are typically returned to different classes based on rules described in the trust documents 
principal and interest payments may also be divided between holders of different securities in the cmo and some securities may only receive interest payments while others receive only principal payments 
these securities are collateralized by pools of fixed rate mortgage loans frms  adjustable rate mortgage loans arms or hybrid arms 
hybrid arms are mortgage loans that have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period typically three  five  seven or years and  thereafter  reset at regular intervals subject to interest rate caps 
our allocation of investments among securities collateralized by frms  arms or hybrid arms will depend on our assessment of the relative value of the securities  which will be based on numerous factors including  but not limited to  expected future prepayment trends  supply and demand  costs of financing  costs of hedging  expected future interest rate volatility and the overall shape of the us treasury and interest rate swap yield curves 
as of december   our billion investment portfolio was financed with billion of repurchase agreements and billion of equity capital  resulting in a leverage ratio of approximately times our stockholders equity 
when adjusted for the net payable for agency securities purchased but not yet settled  the leverage ratio was approximately times our stockholders equity as of december  financing spreads the difference between yields on our investments and rates on related borrowings  including amortization expense related to terminated swaps averaged basis points during the year ended december  the size and composition of our investment portfolio depends on investment strategies being implemented by management  the availability of investment capital and overall market conditions  including the availability of attractively priced investments and suitable financing to appropriately leverage our investment portfolio 
market conditions are influenced by  among other things  current levels of and expectations for future levels of  short term interest rates  mortgage prepayments  market liquidity and government participation in the market 
our active portfolio management strategy our manager employs on our behalf an active management strategy to achieve our principal objectives of generating attractive risk adjusted returns and the preserving our net asset value 
our active management strategy 
table of contents involves buying and selling securities in all sectors of the agency securities market  including fixed rate agency securities  adjustable rate agency securities  options on agency securities and agency cmos  based on our manager s continual assessment of the relative value and risk and return of these securities 
therefore  the composition of our portfolio will vary as our manager believes changes to market conditions  risks and valuations warrant 
consequently  we may experience investment gains or losses when we sell securities that our manager no longer believes provide attractive risk adjusted returns or when our manager believes more attractive alternatives are available in the agency securities market 
we may also experience fluctuations in leverage as we pursue our active management strategy  but we generally would expect our leverage to be within six to eleven times the amount of our stockholders equity 
for further discussion of our active management strategy please refer to the results of operations section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december  our financing strategy as part of our investment strategy  we leverage our investment portfolio pursuant to master repurchase agreements 
a repurchase transaction acts as a financing arrangement under which we effectively pledge our agency securities as collateral to secure a short term loan 
our borrowings pursuant to these repurchase transactions generally have maturities that range from to days  but may have maturities of less than days or up to days 
our leverage may vary periodically depending on market conditions and our assessment of risk and returns 
we generally would expect our leverage to be within six to eleven times the amount of our stockholders equity 
however  under certain market conditions  we may operate at leverage levels outside of this range for extended periods of time 
we also cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in borrowing sufficient amounts to fund our intended acquisitions of agency securities 
see item business in this annual report on form k for further discussion on our financing strategy 
our hedging strategy as part of our risk management strategy  we may hedge our exposure to interest rate and prepayment risk as our manager determines is in our best interest given our investment strategy  the cost of the hedging transactions and our intention to qualify as a reit 
as a result  we may elect to bear a level of interest rate or prepayment risk that could otherwise be hedged when our manager believes  based on all relevant facts  that bearing the risk enhances our risk return profile 
our manager designs an interest rate risk management program consistent with its outlook for the market to attempt to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio and related borrowings 
we may enter into interest rate swap agreements  interest rate swaptions  caps  collars  floors  forward contracts  options or futures to attempt to manage the overall interest rate risk of the portfolio  reduce fluctuations in book value and generate additional income distributable to stockholders 
see item business in this annual report on form k for further discussion on our hedging strategy 
our option strategy as part of our risk management strategy  we may purchase tba securities or write put or call options on tba securities as a method of insulating our stockholders equity and enhancing our risk return profile 
our manager implements this strategy based upon overall market conditions  the level of volatility in the mortgage market  size of our agency securities portfolio  notional value of our swap positions outstanding and our intention to qualify as a reit 
summary of critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies relate to investment accounting  revenue recognition  securities valuation  derivative accounting and income taxes 
each of these items involves estimates that will require management to 
table of contents make judgments that are subjective in nature 
we rely on our manager s experience and analysis of historical and current market data in order to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates 
under different conditions  we could report materially different amounts using these critical accounting policies 
investments sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 
 which is codified primarily in fasb asc topic  investments debt and equity securities asc  requires that at the time of purchase  we designate a security as held to maturity  available for sale or trading depending on our ability and intent to hold such security to maturity 
securities classified as trading and available for sale are reported at fair value  while securities classified as held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
we may  from time to time  sell any of our agency securities as part of our overall management of our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we classify all of our agency securities as available for sale 
all securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income loss oci  a component of stockholders equity 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas and  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairment fsp fas  which is codified in fasb asc section asc 
fsp fas changed the other than temporary impairment otti model for debt securities such that an otti is triggered if i an entity has the intent to sell the security  ii it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery  or iii it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
in addition  if there is an otti charge  fsp fas generally requires that any credit loss component of the otti charge be recognized in earnings and the remainder of the otti charge remain in oci 
asc as it relates to fsp fas is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  we adopted the requirements of asc as they relate to fsp fas as of march  the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate securities for otti on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such evaluation 
based on the criteria in asc  the determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired involves judgments and assumptions based on subjective and objective factors 
when an agency security is impaired  an otti is considered to have occurred if i we intend to sell the agency security or ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the agency security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if we intend to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the agency security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the entire amount of the impairment loss is recognized in earnings as an unrealized loss and the cost basis of the security is adjusted 
we did not recognize any other than temporary impairment on any of our agency securities for the year ended december  and for the period from may  through december  interest income interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount of the agency securities and their contractual terms 
premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of agency securities are amortized or accreted into interest income over the projected lives of the securities  including contractual payments and estimated prepayments using the interest method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  which is codified in fasb asc subtopic  receivables nonrefundable fees and other costs 
we estimate long term prepayment speeds using third party services  market data and internal models 
these third party services estimate prepayment speeds using models that incorporate the forward yield curve  current mortgage rates  current mortgage rates of the outstanding loans  loan age  volatility and other factors 
our 
table of contents manager reviews the prepayment speeds estimated by the third party services and compares the results to market consensus prepayment speeds  if available  and internal prepayment models 
our manager also considers historical prepayment speeds and current market conditions to validate reasonableness 
actual and anticipated prepayment experience is reviewed quarterly and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between the previously estimated future prepayment and the amounts actually received plus current anticipated future prepayments 
if the actual and anticipated future prepayment experience differs from our prior estimate of prepayments  we are required to make an adjustment in the current period to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income 
repurchase agreements we finance the acquisition of agency securities for our investment portfolio through repurchase transactions under master repurchase agreements 
repurchase transactions are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried at their contractual amounts  including accrued interest  as specified in the respective transactions 
due to their short term nature  repurchase agreements are carried at cost which approximates fair value 
in instances where we acquire agency securities through repurchase agreements with the same counterparty from whom the agency securities were purchased  we account for the purchase commitment and repurchase agreement on a net basis and record a forward commitment to purchase agency securities as a derivative instrument if the transaction does not comply with the criteria in fasb staff position fas  accounting for transfers of financial assets and repurchase financing transactions fsp fas  which is codified in fasb asc topic  transfers and servicing asc for gross presentation 
if the transaction does not comply with the criteria for gross presentation in asc  such forward commitments are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in income 
if the transaction complies with the criteria for gross presentation in asc  we record both the assets and the related financing on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheet and the corresponding interest income and interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
for the year ended december  and for the period from may  through december   we did not have any seller financed acquisitions of agency securities that did not qualify for gross presentation 
derivatives instruments we maintain an interest rate risk management strategy under which we use derivative financial instruments to manage the adverse impact of interest rates changes on the value of our investment portfolio as well as our cash flows 
in particular we attempt to mitigate the risk of the cost of our short term variable rate liabilities increasing at a faster rate than the earnings of our long term assets during a period of rising interest rates 
the principal derivatives instruments that we use are interest rate swaps  interest rate swaptions  tba agency securities  options and futures 
we account for derivatives in accordance with asc asc requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and to measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
derivatives that are intended to hedge exposure to variability in expected future cash flows are considered cash flow hedges 
for derivatives designated in qualifying cash flow hedging relationships  the effective portion of the fair value adjustments are initially recorded in oci a component of stockholders equity and reclassified to income at the time that the hedged transactions affect earnings 
the ineffective portion of the fair value adjustments is recognized in gain loss on derivative instruments in net income immediately 
for derivatives not designated in hedging relationships under asc  the fair value adjustments are recorded in gain loss on derivative instruments in net income 
derivatives in a gain position are reported as derivative assets at fair value  and derivatives in a loss position are reported as derivative liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet 
when the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist  all changes in the fair value of the instrument are included in gain loss on derivative instruments in net income for each period until the 
table of contents derivative instrument matures or is settled 
any amounts that have been previously deferred in accumulated oci may need to be reclassified to net income 
any gain loss on derivative instruments is included in the operating section in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
we use interest rate swaps to hedge the variable cash flows associated with short term borrowings made under our repurchase agreement facilities 
we generally enter into such derivatives with the intention of qualifying for hedge accounting 
we may purchase interest rate swaptions to help mitigate the potential impact of large increases or decreases in interest rates on the performance of our investment portfolio referred to as convexity risk 
the interest rate swaptions provide us the option to enter into an interest rate swap agreement for a predetermined notional amount  stated term and pay and receive interest rates in the future 
the premium paid for interest rate swaptions is reported as an asset in our consolidated balance sheets 
the premium is valued at an amount equal to the fair value of the swaption that would have the effect of closing the position 
the difference between the premium and the fair value of the swaption is reported in gain loss on derivative instruments in our consolidated statement of operations 
when a swaption expires unexercised  a realized loss is reported in our consolidated statement of operations equal to the premium paid 
when we exercise a swaption  a realized gain or loss is reported in our consolidated statement of operations equal to the difference between the fair value of the underlying interest rate swap and the premium paid 
a tba security is a futures contract for the purchase or sale of agency securities at a predetermined price  face amount  issuer  coupon and stated maturity on an agreed upon future date 
the specific agency securities delivered into the contract upon the settlement date  published each month by the securities industry and financial markets association  are not known at the time of the transaction 
tba securities are exempt from asc if there is no other way to purchase or sell that security  delivery of that security and settlement will occur within the shortest period possible for that type of security and it is probable at inception and throughout the term of the individual contract that physical delivery of the security will occur 
for the tba security contracts that we have entered into  we have not asserted that physical settlement is probable 
accordingly  we have accounted for all such commitments as derivatives and accordingly all realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in our consolidated statement of operations 
we may write put and call options on tba securities to hedge against short term changes in interest rates 
under a put option  the counterparty has the right to sell us a specified tba security at a predetermined price on the option exercise date in exchange for a premium at execution 
under a call option  the counterparty has the right to purchase from us a specified tba security at a predetermined price on the option exercise date in exchange for a premium at execution 
the premium received from writing a put or call option is reported as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
the premium is valued at an amount equal to the fair value of the option that would have the effect of closing the position 
the difference between the premium and the fair value of the option is reported in gain loss on derivative instruments in our consolidated statement of operations 
when a written put or call option expires unexercised  a realized gain is reported in our consolidated statement of operations equal to the premium received 
when we terminate a written put or call option  a realized gain or loss is reported in our consolidated statement of operations equal to the difference between the termination payment and the premium received 
when a written put or call option is exercised  a realized gain or loss is reported in our consolidated statement of operations equal to the difference between the premium received and the fair value of the exercised put or call option 
in addition  a derivative asset or liability is recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for the tba security resulting from the put or call option exercise 
we may enter into a forward commitment to purchase or sell specified agency securities as a hedge against short term changes in interest rates 
contracts for the purchase or sale of specified agency securities are accounted for as derivatives if the delivery of the specified agency security and settlement extends beyond the shortest period possible for that type of security 
we may designate the forward commitment as a qualifying cash flow hedge if at the time of the purchase or sale of the security and throughout the term of the individual contract 
table of contents that physical delivery of the security will occur 
for the forward commitments that we have not asserted that physical settlement is probable  we have accounted for such commitments as derivatives and recognized all realized and unrealized gains and losses on those commitments in our consolidated statement of operations 
we estimate the fair value of interest rate swaps and interest rate swaptions based on the estimated net present value of the future cash flows using a forward interest rate yield curve in effect as of the measurement period  adjusted for non performance risk based on our credit risk and our counterparty s credit risk 
we consider the impact of any collateral requirements  credit enhancements or netting arrangements on credit risk 
tba securities and forward settling contracts to purchase or sell securities are valued using third party pricing services 
these third party pricing services use pricing models that incorporate such factors as coupons  prepayment speeds  spread to the treasury and swap curves  convexity  duration  periodic and life caps and credit enhancement 
the use of derivatives creates exposure to credit risk relating to potential losses that could be recognized in the event that the counterparties to these instruments fail to perform their obligations under the contracts 
we minimize this risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings and monitoring positions with individual counterparties 
income taxes we elected to be taxed as a reit under the provisions of the code and the corresponding provisions of state law  commencing with the tax year ended december  in order to qualify as a reit  we must annually distribute  in a timely manner to our stockholders  at least of our taxable ordinary income 
a reit is not subject to tax on its earnings to the extent that it distributes its annual taxable income to its stockholders and as long as certain asset  income and stock ownership tests are met 
we operate in a manner that will allow us to be taxed as a reit 
as permitted by the code  a reit can designate dividends paid in the subsequent year as dividends of the current year if those dividends are both declared by the extended due date of the reit s federal income tax return and paid to stockholders by the last day of the subsequent year 
as of december   we had undistributed taxable income of million that we expect to declare by our extended due date of our federal income tax return and pay in accordingly  we do not expect to incur any income tax liability on our taxable income 
if we fail to qualify as a reit and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions  we would be subject to federal  state and local income taxes and may be precluded from qualifying as a reit for the subsequent four fiscal years following the year in which the reit qualification was lost 
we declared dividends of million and million  or per share and per share  for the year ended december  and period from may  through december  for income tax purposes  our dividends to stockholders for the fiscal year ended december  were composed of per share of ordinary income and per share of long term capital gains 
for income tax purposes  our dividends to stockholders for the period from may  through december  were composed of ordinary income 
as a reit  if we fail to distribute in any calendar year at least the sum of i of our ordinary income for such year  ii of our capital gain net income for such year  and iii any undistributed taxable income from the prior year  we would be subject to a non deductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the sum of i the amounts actually distributed and ii the amounts of income we retained and on which we have paid corporate income tax 
for the year ended december   we did not distribute the required minimum amount as outlined above and were subject to an excise tax of million  which is included in our provision for income taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
for the period from may  through december   we distributed the minimum required amount to avoid the payment of any excise tax 

table of contents our domestic taxable reit subsidiary  american capital agency trs  llc  will be subject to federal  state and  if applicable  local income tax 
for the period from may  through december  and the year ended december   we had no activity in american capital agency trs  llc 
we evaluate uncertain income tax positions  if any  in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
 which is codified in fasb asc topic  income taxes asc 
based on our analysis of our position  we concluded that we do not have any uncertain tax positions that meet the recognition or measurement criteria of asc as of december  and we classify interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of provision for income taxes

the stated contractual final maturity of the mortgage loans underlying our portfolio of agency securities ranges up to years  but the expected maturity is subject to change based on the actual and expected future prepayments of the underlying loans 
as of december  and  the average final contractual maturity of the agency securities in our investment portfolio was and years  respectively 
the estimated weighted average months to maturity of the agency 
table of contents securities in the tables below are based upon our prepayment expectations  which are estimated  based on assumptions for different securities using a combination of third party services  market data and internal models 
the third party services estimate prepayment speeds using models that incorporate the forward yield curve  mortgage rates  current mortgage rates of the outstanding loans  loan age  volatility and other factors 
as market conditions are changing rapidly  we use judgment in making adjustments to our models for some products 
various market participants could use materially different assumptions 
as of december   we held fixed rate pass through agency securities  pass through agency securities collateralized by arms and hybrid arms  with coupons linked to various indices  and cmos

as interest rates rise  the rate of refinancings typically declines  which may result in lower rates of prepayment and  as a result  a lower portfolio cpr 
conversely  as interest rates fall  the rate of refinancings typically increases  which we expect may result in higher rates of prepayment and  as a result  a higher portfolio cpr 
as of december   our portfolio was purchased at a net premium 
the actual cpr was approximately for the year ended december  and approximately for the period from 
table of contents may  through december  in determining the yield on our agency securities  we have assumed that the cpr over the remaining projected life of our aggregate investment portfolio is as of december  we make different prepayment assumptions for the individual securities that comprise the investment portfolio and these individual assumptions can differ materially from the average 
there is also considerable uncertainty around prepayment speeds in this environment and actual speeds could differ materially from our estimates 
furthermore  us government agency or us government entity buyouts of loans in imminent risk of default  loans that have been modified  or loans that have defaulted will generally be reflected as prepayments on agency securities and also increase the uncertainty around these estimates 
in addition  securities were purchased with different amounts of premiums and therefore the yield on some securities is more sensitive to changes in prepayment speeds

in february  our board of directors approved the removal of a guideline that limited our leverage to not greater than times our stockholders equity as computed in accordance with gaap 
certain of our master repurchase agreements and master swap agreements contain a restriction that prohibits our leverage from exceeding times the amount of our stockholders equity

table of contents during the quarter ended march   we sold agency securities with a cost basis of  million for proceeds of  million  realizing a gross gain of million and a gross loss of million  for a net gain of million 
the transactions were primarily related to diversifying our portfolio from predominately and year fixed rate securities to securities backed by seasoned  higher coupon hybrid arms 
our strategy was based on our manager s belief that these securities provided a more attractive investment alternative to many of our fixed rate holdings 
specifically  our manager believed that a relatively high percentage of borrowers with hybrid arms would be unable to refinance those loans  even in a historically low mortgage rate environment  because of the continued deterioration of housing market conditions  tighter underwriting standards employed by mortgage lenders and gses and the generally weaker credit profile of these borrowers 
our manager believed these securities would experience lower prepayment rates than what their valuations suggested  resulting in a favorable risk return profile 
as of march   securities backed by hybrid arms were of our portfolio at cost compared to as of december  during the quarter ended june   we sold agency securities with a cost basis of  million for proceeds of  million  realizing a gross gain of million and a gross loss of million  for a net gain of million 
the transactions largely involved further purchases of securities backed by hybrid arms and selling securities that our manager felt did not have favorable loan characteristics  including a high refinancing risk 
additionally  we sold some securities that our manager believed were likely to produce lower risk adjusted returns  either as a result of expected interest rate changes or market valuations 
during the quarter ended september   we sold agency securities with a cost basis of  million for proceeds of  million  realizing a gross gain of million and a gross loss of million  for a net gain of million 
the transactions were primarily as a result of our manager shifting its assessment of risk from refinancing risk to gse buyout risk 
buyouts of delinquent loans from mortgage pools have the same prepayment effect as prepayments due to refinancing activity or home sales 
thus  we sold securities with collateral attributes our manager believed would lead to higher rates of delinquencies and  therefore  be at risk of a gse buyout  even though these securities also had attributes that could result in lower prepayments due to refinancing activity 
instead  we acquired securities with collateral attributes our manager believed would result in lower prepayments from potential gse buyouts 
our manager s shift in strategy was based on its belief that the gses would significantly increase their purchases of delinquent loans starting in the first quarter of because of new accounting rules becoming effective on january   which eliminated the recognition of losses by fannie mae and freddie mac when buying out delinquent loans  the accumulation of severely delinquent loans within fannie mae and freddie mac mortgage pools  and fannie mae and freddie mac s low cost of capital and its availability to purchase delinquent loans 
in addition to selling specific securities  we also entered into cmo transactions in order to decrease our exposure to potential gse buyouts 
in these transactions  we transferred agency securities  which our manager believed were at risk of gse buyouts  in exchange for a combination of cash and commitments to issue us cmo securities 
our cmo securities were structured so that we are to receive principal repayments after the other investors in the cmo receive the first to of the principal prepayments 
therefore  we believe that the other investors will bear most of the prepayment risk related to the potential gse buyouts 
during the quarter  we transferred agency securities with a cost basis of million in exchange for cash proceeds of million and a commitment to issue us cmo securities with an agreed principal amount of million for a price of million 
during the quarter ended december   we sold agency securities with a cost basis of  million for proceeds of  million  realizing a gross gain of million and a gross loss of million  for a net gain of million 
the transaction activity during the quarter was largely related to a continued repositioning of our portfolio to mitigate the risk of gse buyouts  including entering into additional cmo transactions similar to the cmo transactions entered into during the prior quarter  whereby we transferred agency securities with a cost basis of million in exchange for cash proceeds of million and commitments to issue us cmo securities with an agreed principal amount of million for a price of million 
as of december   of our portfolio consisted of cmo securities at cost

table of contents income taxes as a reit  we are subject to a nondeductible federal excise tax of if we do not distribute at least of our ordinary taxable income and of our capital gains taxable income for each calendar year ending december  including any undistributed income from the prior excise tax year 
for the period ended december   we did not accrue any federal excise taxes because our calendar year distributions met the minimum distribution requirements 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are borrowings under master repurchase agreements and monthly principal and interest payments on our investment portfolio 
other sources of funds may include proceeds from debt and equity offerings and asset sales 
we generally use our liquidity to pay down borrowings under repurchase arrangements to reduce borrowing costs and otherwise efficiently manage our long term investment capital 
because the level of these borrowings can be adjusted on a daily basis  the level of cash and cash equivalents carried on the balance sheet is significantly less important than the potential liquidity available under our borrowing arrangements 
we currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for the acquisition of additional investments  repayments on borrowings and the payment of cash dividends as required for our continued qualification as a reit 
to qualify as a reit  we must distribute annually at least of our taxable income 
to the extent that we annually distribute all of our taxable income in a timely manner  we will generally not be subject to federal and state income taxes 
we currently expect to distribute all of our taxable income 
this distribution requirement limits our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations 
on june   we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on form s with the sec under the securities act of  as amended the act  with respect to  of common stock or preferred stock that may be sold by us from time to time pursuant to rule of the act 
this registration statement became effective on july  in august  we completed a public offering in which million shares of our common stock  including the over allotment  were sold at a public offering price of per share 
upon completion of the offering we received proceeds  net of the underwriters discount and other offering costs  of approximately million 
in september  we filed a registration statement with the sec under the act with respect to  shares of common stock available for purchase under the american capital agency corp 
dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan the plan 
the plan allows our stockholders to reinvest cash dividends and distributions and purchase shares of common stock of between and  per month and  with our prior approval  in excess of  per month 
in october  we completed a public offering in which million shares of our common stock were sold at a public offering price of per share 
upon completion of the offering we received proceeds  net of the underwriters discount and other offering costs  of approximately million 
to the extent we raise additional equity capital through equity offerings  we currently anticipate using cash proceeds from such transactions to purchase additional agency securities  to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our repurchase agreements and for other general corporate purposes 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to raise additional equity capital at any particular time or on any particular terms 
as part of our investment strategy  we borrow against our investment portfolio pursuant to master repurchase agreements 
we expect that our borrowings pursuant to repurchase transactions under such master repurchase agreements generally will have maturities that range from to days  but may have maturities of less than days or up to days 
when adjusted for the net payable for agency securities purchased but not 
table of contents yet settled  our leverage ratio was times the amount of our stockholders equity as of december  our cost of borrowings under master repurchase agreements generally corresponds to libor plus or minus a margin 
we have master repurchase agreements with financial institutions  subject to certain conditions 
borrowings under repurchase arrangements secured by agency securities totaled billion as of december  as of december   we did not have an amount at risk with any counterparty greater than of our stockholders equity 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further details regarding our borrowings under repurchase agreements and weighted average interest rates as of december  and amounts available to be borrowed under these arrangements are dependent upon lender collateral requirements and the lender s determination of the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral  which fluctuates with changes in interest rates  credit quality and liquidity conditions within the investment banking  mortgage finance and real estate industries 
under the repurchase agreements  we may be required to pledge additional assets to the repurchase agreement counterparties ie  lenders in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
similarly  if the estimated fair value of investment securities increases due to changes in the market interest rates  lenders may release collateral back to us 
specifically  margin calls would result from a decline in the value of the agency securities securing our repurchase agreements and prepayments on the mortgages securing such agency securities 
as of december   we have met all margin requirements 
we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million and unpledged agency securities of million available to meet margin calls on our repurchase agreements and derivative instruments as of december  although we believe that we will have adequate sources of liquidity available to us through repurchase agreement financing to execute our business strategy  there can be no assurances that repurchase agreement financing will be available to us upon the maturity of our current repurchase agreements to allow us to renew or replace our repurchase agreement financing on favorable terms or at all 
if our repurchase agreement lenders default on their obligations to resell the underlying agency securities back to us at the end of the term  we could incur a loss equal to the difference between the value of the agency securities and the cash we originally received 
we maintain an interest rate risk management strategy under which we use derivative financial instruments to manage the adverse impact of interest rates changes on the value of our investment portfolio as well as our cash flows 
in particular we attempt to mitigate the risk of the cost of our short term variable rate liabilities increasing at a faster rate than the earnings of our long term assets during a period of rising interest rates 
the principal derivative instruments that we use are interest rate swaps  interest rate swaptions  tba agency securities  options and futures 
we use interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in fixed rates on a portion of our short term borrowings because longer term committed borrowings are not available at attractive terms 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to attempt to mitigate the risk of the cost of our short term variable rate liabilities rising during a period of rising interest rates  thereby compressing the net spreads that we earn on our long term fixed rate assets 
as of december   our interest rate swap agreements had notional amounts totaling billion and were designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes of a like amount of our short term borrowings 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further details regarding our outstanding interest rate swaps as of december  and and the related activity for the year ended december  we may be limited on the types of hedging strategies we can deploy as a reit under the code  therefore  we may implement part of our hedging strategy through american capital agency trs  llc  our domestic taxable reit subsidiary  which will be subject to federal  state and  if applicable  local income tax 
as of december   we had not transacted any hedging transactions through american capital agency trs  llc

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s 
market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risks that we are exposed to are interest rate risk  prepayment risk  liquidity risk  extension risk and inflation risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the level of interest rates can also affect the rate of prepayments of our securities and the value of the agency securities that constitute our investment portfolio  which affects our ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets and impacts our ability and the amount that we can borrow against these securities 

table of contents we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  swaptions  caps  collars  floors  purchases and sales of tba agency securities and specified agency securities on a forward basis  or put and call options on securities or securities underlying futures contracts  in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations 
when we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  we may be subject to certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of our common stock and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments 
our profitability and the value of our investment portfolio including derivatives used for hedging purposes may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates including resulting changes in forward yield curves 
the following table quantifies the estimated changes in net interest income and investment portfolio value should interest rates go up or down by and basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
these estimates were compiled using a combination of third party services  market data and internal models 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and investment portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates as of december  given the low level of interest rates  we also apply a floor of for all anticipated interest rates included in our assumptions  such that any hypothetical interest rate decrease would have a limited positive impact on our funding costs beyond a certain level 
however  because estimated prepayment speeds are unaffected by this floor  it is expected that an increase in our prepayment speeds as a result of a hypothetical interest rate decrease would result in an acceleration of our premium amortization and could result in reinvestment of such prepaid principal into lower yielding assets 
actual results could differ materially from estimates  especially in the current market environment 
the accuracy of the projected agency securities prices relies on assumptions that define specific agency securities spreads and varying prepayment assumptions at projected interest rate levels 
to the extent that these estimates or other assumptions do not hold true  which is likely in a period of high price volatility  actual results will likely differ materially from projections and could be larger or smaller than the estimates in the table below 
moreover  if different models were employed in the analysis  materially different projections could result 
in addition  while the tables below reflect the estimated impact of interest rate increases and decreases on a static portfolio we may from time to time sell any of our agency securities as a part of our overall management of our investment portfolio 
change in interest rate percentage change in projected net interest income percentage change in projected portfolio value  with effect of derivatives basis points basis points basis points basis points prepayment risk premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of agency securities are amortized or accreted into interest income over the projected lives of the securities  including contractual payments and estimated prepayments using the interest method 
furthermore  us government agency or us government entity buyouts of loans in imminent risk of default  loans that have been modified  or loans that have defaulted will generally be reflected as prepayments on agency securities and also increase the uncertainty around these estimates 
our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate published prepayment data for similar agency securities  market consensus and current market conditions 
if the actual prepayment experienced differs from our estimate of prepayments  we will be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income 

table of contents spread risk our available for sale securities are reflected at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in oci pursuant to asc as of december   the fair value of these securities was billion 
when the spread between the yield on our agency securities and us treasuries or swap rates widens  this could cause the value of our agency securities to decline  creating what we refer to as spread risk 
the spread risk associated with our agency securities and the resulting fluctuations in fair value of these securities can occur independent of interest rates and may relate to other factors impacting the mortgage and fixed income markets such as liquidity or changes in required rates of return on different assets 
liquidity risk the primary liquidity risk for us arises from financing long term assets with shorter term borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements 
our assets which are pledged to secure repurchase agreements are high quality agency securities and cash 
as of december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million and unpledged agency securities of million available to meet margin calls on our repurchase agreements  derivative instruments and for other corporate purposes 
however  should the value of our agency securities pledged as collateral suddenly decrease  margin calls relating to our repurchase agreements could increase  causing an adverse change in our liquidity position 
as such  we cannot assure that we will always be able to renew or roll our repurchase agreements 
extension risk the projected weighted average life of our investments is based on our assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the underlying mortgage loans 
in general  when we acquire an agency security collateralized by frms or hybrid arms  we may  but are not required to  enter into an interest rate swap agreement or other hedging instrument that effectively fixes our borrowing costs for a period close to the anticipated average life of the fixed rate portion of the related assets 
this strategy is designed to protect us from rising interest rates because the borrowing costs are fixed for the duration of the fixed rate portion of the related agency security 
however  if prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment  the life of the fixed rate portion of the related assets could extend beyond the term of the swap agreement or other hedging instrument 
this could have a negative impact on our results from operations  as borrowing costs would no longer be fixed after the end of the hedging instrument while the income earned on the agency securities collateralized by frms or hybrid arms would remain fixed 
this situation may also cause the market value of our agency security collateralized by frms or hybrid arms to decline  with little or no offsetting gain from the related hedging transactions 
in extreme situations  we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity  which could cause us to incur losses 
inflation risk virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance more so than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
further  our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our distributions are determined by our board of directors based primarily by our net income as calculated for income tax purposes 
in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and or fair market value without considering inflation
