table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of the results of our operations for the twelve months ended december   and and of our financial condition at december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and that are not historical facts  including statements about our beliefs and expectations 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and particularly under the headings risk factors  business and forward looking statements contained in item a  item  and part i of this report  respectively 
on january   we announced a new organizational structure where we intend to manage our insurance and reinsurance businesses as two underwriting segments  aspen insurance and aspen reinsurance  to enhance and better serve our global customer base 
for additional details  see recent developments below 
aspen s year in review our principal objective in was to continue to proactively manage our insurance and reinsurance portfolios in line with market conditions  while identifying opportunities to further diversify into profitable lines of business that have an appropriate strategic fit  financial prospects based on a strong track record and fit within our risk profile 
we maintained a high quality investment portfolio  while exiting our alternative investments in funds of hedge funds during capital management 
during  we continued to execute our strategy to optimize our capital structure  repurchasing million of our liquidation value preference shares nyse ahl pa at a price of per share 
in conjunction with that transaction  we issued million ordinary shares with this being the primary driver of the increase in our total shares outstanding from million at the end of to million at december  diversification 
during  we entered the credit and surety reinsurance and specie insurance markets  through our offices in zurich  london and connecticut 
investment management 
in february  we gave notice to redeem the balance of our involvement in the funds of hedge funds with effect on june  as a result  we recognized proceeds receivable from the redemption of funds of million at june  our active investment and other obligations with the funds ceased at june  the carrying value of the receivables represents our maximum exposure to loss at the balance sheet date 
the outstanding balance of million is expected to be received subsequent to the completion of the audited financial statements for the funds 
the duration of our fixed income portfolio has increased from approximately years at december  to years at december  and the book yield on our fixed income portfolio has reduced from at december  to at december  in  we also recognized other than temporary impairment charges of million 
at december   approximately of our fixed income securities comprised asset backed and mortgage backed securities  none of which we believe fall into the sub prime category 
we had negligible direct exposure to hybrid and preferred securities

financial overview the following overview of our  and operating results and financial condition is intended to identify important themes and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion further below 
net income 
for  we reported income after taxes of million  a million increase over the prior year 
the increase is due to a combination of improved underwriting performance mainly arising from an absence of catastrophe losses  higher earned premium from teams established in and and a increase in investment income from million in to million in this contrasts with which was impacted by adverse underwriting performance mainly arising from losses of million  net of reinsurance recoveries  reinstatement premiums and tax following hurricanes ike and gustav and adverse investment performance due to the turmoil in the financial markets which resulted in losses of million from our investment in funds of hedge funds and million of investment impairment charges 
net income after taxes of million in included underwriting income of million  reflecting a benign catastrophe season  and investment income of million including a million contribution from our investments in funds of hedge funds 
gross written premiums 
total gross written premiums increased by in compared to  and by in compared to the changes in gross written premiums in each of our segments for the twelve months ended december  and are as follows  with reductions shown as negative percentages 
gross written premiums for the twelve months for the twelve months for the twelve months business segment ended december  ended december  ended december  in millions increase in millions increase in millions decrease decrease property reinsurance casualty reinsurance international insurance us insurance total gross written premiums for have increased to  million from  million in due mainly to increased contributions from our property reinsurance and us insurance segments  which were offset by declines in our international insurance and casualty reinsurance segments 
the property reinsurance segment has benefited from a million contribution from the newly established credit and surety reinsurance business written in our zurich office 
our us insurance segment has also experienced growth in the year  predominantly in the property line where gross written premiums increased from million in to million in due to new business growth and increased prices for catastrophe exposed business 
gross written premiums in the international insurance segment have decreased marginally by to million when compared to due to a lack of demand for gulf of mexico energy cover  the repositioning of the financial institutions book and the uk liability book as we actively manage the cycle  compensating for an increase in premiums written in some of the other business lines 
we have seen a small decrease of in gross written premiums in the casualty reinsurance segment in response to the softening market 
the increase in gross written premiums in  when compared with  was driven by a million contribution from new underwriting teams in international insurance established in the final quarter of and during this was offset by premium reductions in a number of our 
table of contents established lines  in particular property treaty catastrophe  property treaty risk excess  international casualty treaty reinsurance and uk commercial liability insurance 
reinsurance 
total reinsurance ceded in the year ended december  of million was million higher than in the corresponding period in the overall increase was due to an unusually low level in as we took advantage of favorable pricing conditions in which enabled us to purchase a number of reinsurance contracts covering a period of greater than months  effectively covering the windstorm season 
costs in were impacted  however  by the recognition of million of additional reinsurance premiums to reinstate cover from our reinsurance program following hurricane ike 
loss ratio 
we monitor the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premium the loss ratio as a measure of relative underwriting performance where a lower ratio represents a better result than a higher ratio 
the loss ratios for our four business segments for the twelve months ended december   and were as follows loss ratios for the twelve months for the twelve months for the twelve months business segment ended december  ended december  ended december  property reinsurance casualty reinsurance international insurance us insurance total the reduction in the property reinsurance loss ratio in was due mainly to an absence of major catastrophes when compared to million of losses  net of reinsurance recoveries and reinstatement costs  associated with hurricanes ike and gustav in the decrease in the loss ratio can also be attributed to reserve releases which increased to million in compared to million in the loss ratio for casualty reinsurance increased to from in mainly as a result of less favorable development on prior accident years  particularly in our international casualty treaty line 
reserve releases reduced from million in to million in in  we recognized million of reserve releases emanating mainly from our us casualty treaty account 
the loss ratio for the international insurance segment has reduced to in from in mainly due to the results being impacted by million of net losses and million of net additional reinstatement costs following hurricanes ike and gustav 
the loss ratio was also impacted by a net reserve strengthening of million whereas in  we have released million from reserves due to favorable prior year development 
in  there was an absence of catastrophe losses and reserve releases of million which had a favorable impact on the loss ratio 
the us insurance segment had a loss ratio in of up from in the increase in the loss ratio is due to deterioration from our casualty insurance business line which has recorded a net reserve strengthening of million in due to adverse experience from our new york contractors business 
prior year reserve movements 
the loss ratios take into account any changes in our assessments of reserves for unpaid claims and loss adjustment expenses arising from earlier years 
in each of the years ended december   and  we recorded a reduction in the level of reserves for prior 
table of contents years 
the amounts of these reductions and their effects on the loss ratio in each year are shown in the following table for the twelve months for the twelve months for the twelve months ended december  ended december  ended december  in millions  except for percentages reserve releases of net premiums earned although total reserve releases for are in line with  an increase in property reinsurance reserve releases has offset smaller reserve releases from our casualty reinsurance segment 
total reserve releases in are marginally higher than but have a lower impact on the loss ratio due to an increase in net earned premium 
the reserve releases in were million lower than in due predominantly to reserve strengthening in our international insurance segment compared to reserve releases in prior years 
further information relating to the release of reserves can be found below under reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses prior year loss reserves 
expense ratio 
we monitor the ratio of expenses to net earned premium the expense ratio as a measure of the cost effectiveness of our business acquisition  operating and administrative processes 
the table below presents the contribution of the policy acquisition expenses and operating and administrative expenses to the expense ratio and the total expense ratios for the twelve months ended december   and expense ratios for the for the for the twelve months ended twelve months ended twelve months ended december  december  december  policy acquisition expenses operating and administrative expenses expense ratio policy acquisition expenses have increased from million in to million in  due primarily to commissions associated with the million increase in gross earned premium but also due to the impact of profit related commissions 
the ratio benefited from million of reinstatement and profit related premium increases which incurred no additional acquisition costs in addition to lower profit commission accruals in a catastrophe affected year 
the higher policy acquisition expenses in were largely due to the impact from profit related commissions 
operating and administrative expenses increased by million to million in when compared to due predominantly to performance related remuneration linked to our improved performance during the year 
operating and administrative expenses increased by million in when compared to  due mainly to a million rise in costs in our international insurance segment resulting from our entry into new business lines  which was partially offset by a reduction in performance related remuneration and a weakening of the british pound against the us dollar 
net investment income 
in  we generated net investment income of million  up on the prior year million  million 
the increase was mainly due to our investments in funds of hedge funds which contributed million to net investment income in compared to a loss of million in our fixed income portfolio book yield reduced to at december  from at december  
total cash and investments including accrued interest and receivables for investments sold increased from billion at the end of to billion at december  billion 
the fixed income portfolio duration increased from years in to years in years and the average credit quality of our fixed income book is aa  with of the portfolio being graded aa or higher 
the average 
table of contents credit quality of our fixed income investment portfolio was aa at the end of and aa at the end of cartesian iris a lp cartesian iris a lp is a variable interest entity under the guidance contained in asc consolidations

in addition to returns on our investment  we provide services on risk selection  pricing and portfolio design in return for a percentage of profits from iris re 
in the twelve months ended december   a fee of million was payable to us 
for more information please see notes and to the audited financial statements for the twelve months ended december  included elsewhere in this report 
in the twelve months ended december   our share of gains and losses increased the value of our investment by million to million nil 
the increase in value has been recognized in realized and unrealized gains and losses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations 
change in fair value of derivatives 
in the twelve months ended december   we recorded a reduction in the fair value of derivatives of million million  million 
this included a reduction of million million  million in the estimated fair value of our credit insurance contract 
in the twelve months ended december   a charge of million for a catastrophe swap which expired on august  was also included 
at december   there were no outstanding foreign currency contracts 
at december   we held foreign currency derivative contracts to purchase million of us and foreign currencies 
the foreign currency contracts are recorded as derivatives at fair value with changes recorded as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss in our statement of operations 
for the twelve months ended december   the impact of foreign currency contracts on net income was million 
for the twelve months ended december   the impact of foreign currency contracts on net income was a loss of million loss of million 
further information on these contracts can be found in note to the financial statements 
other revenues and expenses 
other revenues and expenses in included million of foreign currency exchange gains million losses  million gains and million of realized investment gains million losses  million gains 
the increase in realized investment gains in was due to a significant reduction in charges associated with investments we believe to be other than temporarily impaired from million in to million in nil 
interest payable was million in million  million 
other than temporary impairments 
we review all of our fixed maturities for potential impairment each quarter based on criteria including issuer specific circumstances  credit ratings actions and general macro economic conditions 
the process of determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary requires considerable judgment 
as part of the assessment process we also evaluate whether it is more likely than not that we will sell any fixed maturity security in an unrealized loss position before its market value recovers to amortized cost 
once a security has been identified as other than temporarily impaired  the amount of any impairment included in net income is determined by reference to the portion of the unrealized loss that is considered credit related 
non credit related unrealized losses are included in other comprehensive income 
in the twelve months ended december   realized investments losses include a million charge for investments we believe to be other than temporarily impaired million 
other than temporary impairment losses of million for the year were considered to be credit related and therefore are included in the income statement 
the other than temporary impairment charge of million in was attributable mainly to the write down of lehman brothers bonds subsequent to that company s collapse in september 
table of contents taxes 
we incurred a tax expense in of million million  equivalent to a consolidated rate on income before tax of compared to in and in the reduction in the effective tax rate from in to in is due to strong underwriting results in bermuda and the distribution of investment returns biased towards jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
dividends 
the quarterly dividend has been maintained at per ordinary share for  and dividends paid on the preference shares in each of and were million while in  payments reduced to million as a result of repurchasing million of our liquidation value preference shares nyse ahl pa at a price of per share 
shareholders equity and financial leverage 
total shareholders equity increased from  million at the end of december  to  million as at december  the most significant movements were net income after tax for the year of million  an increase in net of tax unrealized gains on investments of million  accounted for in other comprehensive income  and dividend payments to ordinary and preference shareholders totaling million in as at december   total ordinary shareholders equity was  million compared to  million at december  as at december   the remainder of our total shareholders equity was funded by two classes of preference shares with a total value as measured by their respective liquidation preferences of million million less issue costs of million million 
the amount under our senior notes was the only material debt that we had outstanding as of december   and management monitors the ratio of debt to total capital  with total capital being defined as shareholders equity plus outstanding debt 
at december   this ratio was  
our preference shares are classified in our balance sheet as equity but may receive a different treatment in some cases under the capital adequacy assessments made by certain rating agencies 
such securities are often referred to as hybrids as they have certain attributes of both debt and equity 
we also monitor the ratio of the total of debt and hybrids to total capital which was as of december  diluted tangible book value per ordinary share at december  was  an increase of compared to at december  tangible book value per ordinary share is based on total shareholders equity  less intangible assets and preference shares liquidation preference less issue expenses  divided by the number of ordinary shares in issue at the end of the period 
balances as at december  and december  were as at as at december  december  in millions  except for share amounts total shareholders equity intangible assets preference shares less issue expenses ordinary shares diluted ordinary shares liquidity 
management monitors the liquidity of aspen holdings and of each of its insurance subsidiaries 
with respect to aspen holdings  management monitors its ability to service debt  to finance 
table of contents dividend payments and to provide financial support to the insurance subsidiaries 
during the period ended december   aspen holdings received a million payment of inter company interest in respect of an inter company loan from aspen uk holdings and also recognized a million dividend from aspen uk holdings 
as at december   aspen holdings held million in cash and cash equivalents which  taken together with our credit facilities and expected levels of future inter company dividends  management considered sufficient to provide us with an appropriate level of liquidity 
at december   the insurance subsidiaries held million in cash and cash equivalents that are readily realizable securities 
management monitors the value  currency and duration of the cash and investments within its insurance subsidiaries to ensure that they are individually able to meet their insurance and other liabilities as they become due and was satisfied that there was a comfortable margin of liquidity as at december  and for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had in issue million and million in letters of credit to cedants  against which we held million and million of collateral 
our reinsurance receivables increased by from million at december  to million at december   mainly as a result of an increase in the estimated receivables from our reinsurers in respect of hurricane claims  additional recoveries associated with financial institutions and us casualty insurance claims 
current market conditions  rate trends and developments in early in summary  there is a general climate of poor rate levels and soft market conditions and we believe this trend will continue as progresses 
we will continue actively to seek out pockets of opportunity and it is core to our diversified strategy to take advantage of such opportunities as they arise 
good progress has been made in our political and financial risk insurance and credit and surety reinsurance lines  both relatively new additions to our portfolio 
the reshaping and restructuring of our us excess and surplus casualty insurance unit evidences our determination to address areas which are not performing as well  and our appetite to continue to refine and invest in our chosen business lines through the recruitment of quality underwriters 
property reinsurance 
within our property reinsurance segment  given the relatively benign catastrophe season and industry balance sheet recovery  the january renewal season proved to be very competitive 
there were modest rate reductions of up to for us peak zone exposures 
we expect that the property reinsurance market may well soften further in and as a result we deployed more of our catastrophic event capacity during the january renewal season than we had first anticipated 
our newly established credit and surety reinsurance team has also performed well during the january renewal season 
casualty reinsurance 
pricing conditions within the casualty reinsurance market continue to be challenging with mixed results depending on line of business and the location of business 
in the us  rates are mostly flat with some single digit declines 
the outlook for our international casualty reinsurance line is more positive with some rate increases in professional lines and continued strengthening of financial institutions rates  while elsewhere  reinsurance rates were flat 
international insurance 
the international insurance segment covers a broad range of business although january is not a significant renewal date for this segment 
however  our marine  energy and construction liability and energy property rates increased by on the part of the portfolio that was renewed in january 
gulf of mexico business is not renewed in january  and therefore no comment can be made on rate conditions for gulf of mexico exposed energy property business 
aviation renews principally in october  however we have seen rate increases of over for airline business with loss events being a major catalyst producing the increase 
our political and financial risk insurance line is not heavily reliant on renewals due to the nature of the business  however  in respect of the business that is subject to renewal  we have seen small rate reductions of up to 
january is not a significant renewal 
table of contents date for our financial institutions and professional liability lines  however at this early stage in the year we are seeing double digit rate increases in our financial institutions line and more modest rate insurances in our professional liability account 
us insurance 
in our us insurance segment we are seeing some rate reductions in catastrophe exposed property risks  however this business continues to remain attractive 
elsewhere  the market continues to be challenging in property and casualty lines 
recent developments on january   we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program with goldman  sachs co 
goldman sachs to repurchase million of our ordinary shares 
a substantial majority of the ordinary shares will be received and cancelled within the first quarter of we may be entitled to receive additional ordinary shares from goldman sachs based on the average of the daily market prices of our ordinary shares during the term of the agreement 
the program is expected to be completed within ten months 
based on our closing share price on january   the million share repurchase represents approximately of our total market capitalization 
the repurchase was made under the terms of our share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors and announced on february  and will complete the full amount of that program 
the purchase has been funded with cash available and the sale of investment assets 
an initial amount of  ordinary shares were retired on january  on february   our board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for up to million of ordinary shares 
the authorization covers the period to march  on january   we announced a new organizational structure where we will manage our insurance and reinsurance businesses under two separate brands  aspen insurance and aspen reinsurance  to enhance and better serve our global customer base 
as a result of our organizational changes  in we intend to manage our business along two operating segments insurance and reinsurance 
under the new organizational structure  our insurance segment will comprise primarily of the existing international insurance and us insurance segments  with rupert villers  global head of financial and professional lines insurance  acting as ceo of aspen insurance 
william murray will continue to lead our us insurance business forming part of our newly established insurance segment 
our reinsurance segment will comprise three divisions  property reinsurance  casualty reinsurance and specialty reinsurance previously part of international insurance 
brian boornazian has been appointed ceo of aspen reinsurance and james few has been appointed as president of aspen reinsurance 
as part of the organizational change  julian cusack has assumed the role of group chief risk officer 
mr 
cusack previously served as chief operating officer 
mr 
cusack will remain chairman and chief executive officer of aspen bermuda and will continue to chair our reserve committee 
on january   we entered into a sale and purchase agreement to purchase apj continuation limited apj and its subsidiaries for an aggregate consideration of million 
the business writes a specialist account of kidnap and ransom insurance which will complement our existing political and financial risk line of business 
mr 
villers  one of our executive officers  was previously a director of apj and is a shareholder 
this transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions 
on february   we entered into a stock purchase agreement to purchase a us insurance company with licenses to write insurance business on an admitted basis in the us we will pay an amount in cash equal to million plus the amount of the target company s closing surplus 
the company is currently licensed to write business in states and the district of columbia 
this transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions 

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective in nature and require management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine the reported values 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
a statement of all the significant accounting policies we use to prepare our financial statements is included in the notes to the financial statements 
if factors such as those described in item a  risk factors cause actual events to differ from the assumptions used in applying the accounting policy and calculating financial results  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
written premiums 
written premiums are comprised of the estimated premiums on contracts of insurance and reinsurance entered into in the reporting period  except in the case of proportional reinsurance contracts  where written premium relates only to our estimated proportional share of premiums due on contracts entered into by the ceding company prior to the end of the reporting period 
all premium estimates are reviewed regularly  comparing actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums along with a review of the collectability of premiums receivable 
based on management s review  the appropriateness of the premium estimates is evaluated  and any adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the periods in which they become known 
adjustments to original premium estimates could be material and these adjustments may directly and significantly impact earnings in the period they are determined because the subject premium may be fully or substantially earned 
we refer to premiums receivable which are not fixed at the inception of the contract as adjustment premiums 
the proportion of adjustable premiums included in the premium estimates varies between business lines with the largest adjustment premiums associated with property and casualty reinsurance business and the smallest with property and liability insurance lines 
adjustment premiums are most significant in relation to reinsurance contracts 
differing considerations apply to non proportional and proportional treaties as follows non proportional treaties 
a large number of the reinsurance contracts we write are written on a non proportional or excess of loss treaty basis 
as the ultimate level of business written by each cedant can only be estimated at the time the reinsurance is placed  the reinsurance contracts generally stipulate a minimum and deposit premium payable under the contract with an adjustable premium determined by variables such as the number of contracts covered by the reinsurance  the total premium received by the cedant and the nature of the exposures assumed 
minimum and deposit premiums generally cover the majority of premiums due under such treaty reinsurance contracts and the adjustable portion of the premium is usually a small portion of the total premium receivable 
for excess of loss contracts  the minimum and deposit premium  as defined in the contract  is generally considered to be the best estimate of the contract s written premium at inception 
accordingly  this is the amount we generally record as written premium in the period the underlying risks incept 
during the life of a contract  notifications from cedants and brokers may affect the estimate of ultimate premium and result in either increases or reductions in reported revenue 
changes in estimated adjustable premiums do not generally have a significant impact on short term liquidity as the payment of adjustment premiums generally occurs after the expiration of a contract 
many non proportional treaties also include a provision for the payment to us by the cedant of reinstatement premiums based on loss experience under such contracts 
reinstatement premiums are the premiums charged for the restoration of the reinsurance limit of an excess of loss contract to its full amount after payment by the reinsurer of losses as a result of an occurrence 
these premiums relate to the future coverage obtained during the remainder of the initial policy term and are included in revenue in the same period as the corresponding losses 

table of contents proportional treaties treaty pro rata 
estimates of premiums assumed under treaty pro rata reinsurance contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks are expected to incept and are based on information provided by brokers and ceding companies and estimates of the underlying economic conditions at the time the risk is underwritten 
we estimate premium receivable initially and update our estimates regularly throughout the contract term based on treaty statements received from the ceding company 
the reported gross written premiums for treaty pro rata business include estimates of premiums due to us but not yet reported by the cedant because of time delays between contracts being written by our cedants and their submission of treaty statements to us 
this additional premium is normally described as pipeline premium 
treaty statements disclose information on the underlying contracts of insurance written by our cedants and are generally submitted on a monthly or quarterly basis  from to days in arrears 
in order to report all risks incepting prior to a period end  we estimate the premiums written between the last submitted treaty statement and the period end 
treaty pro rata made a significant contribution to our property reinsurance segment where we wrote million in gross written premium in million or of our property reinsurance segment  of which million was estimated million and million was reported by the cedants million 
we estimate that the impact of a million change in our estimated gross premiums written in our property treaty pro rata business would have an impact of million on our net income before tax for our property reinsurance segment at december  million  excluding the impact of fixed costs such as reinsurance premiums and operating expenses 
the most likely drivers of change in the estimates in decreasing order of magnitude are changes in the renewal rate or rate of new business acceptances by the cedant insurance companies leading to lower or greater volumes of ceded premiums than our estimate  which could result from changes in the relevant primary market that could affect more than one of our cedants or could be a consequence of changes in marketing strategy or risk appetite by a particular cedant  changes in the rates being charged by cedants  and differences between the pattern of inception dates assumed in our estimate and the actual pattern of inception dates 
we anticipate that ultimate premiums might reasonably be expected to vary by up to as a result of variations in one or more of the assumptions described above  although larger variations are possible 
based on gross written premiums of million million in our property reinsurance treaty pro rata account as of december   a variation of could increase or reduce net income before taxation by approximately million million 
earned premiums 
premiums are recognized as earned evenly over the policy periods using the daily pro rata method 
the premium related to the unexpired portion of each policy at the end of the reporting period is included in the balance sheet as unearned premiums 
premiums receivable 
premiums receivable are recorded as amounts due less any required provision for doubtful accounts 
a significant portion of amounts included as premiums receivable  which represent estimated premiums written  net of commissions  is not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts 
in determining whether or not any bad debt provision is necessary  we consider the financial security of the policyholder  past payment history and any collateral held 
we have not made a provision for doubtful accounts in relation to assumed premium estimates 
in addition  based on the above process  management believes that the premium estimates included in premiums receivable will be collectable and  therefore  we have not maintained a bad debt provision for doubtful accounts on the premiums at december  
table of contents catastrophe swap 
on august   aspen bermuda entered into a risk transfer swap cat swap with a non insurance counterparty 
during the cat swap s year term  which ended on august   aspen bermuda made quarterly payments based on an initial notional amount of million 
in return  aspen bermuda was entitled to receive payments of up to million in total if hurricanes made landfall in florida and caused damage in excess of billion or earthquakes in california caused insured damage in excess of billion 
the latest estimate of the insured loss arising from hurricane katrina published by property claims services pcs on june  was billion  which entitled us to a recovery of approximately million which has been paid to us 
we have decided not to extend the development period under the cat swap and will not be making any further recoveries 
this cat swap fell within the scope of asc derivatives and hedging activities asc and was therefore measured in the balance sheet at fair value with any changes in the fair value shown on the consolidated statement of operations 
the contract expired on august  and has no impact on net income in the twelve months ended december  the impact of this contract on net income at december  was million 
credit insurance contract 
on november   the company entered into a credit insurance contract which  subject to its terms  insures us against losses due to the inability of one or more of our reinsurance counterparties to meet their financial obligations to us 
we consider that this contract is a financial guarantee insurance contract that does not qualify for exemption from treatment for accounting purposes as a derivative 
this is because it provides for the final settlement  expected to take place two years after expiry of cover  to include an amount attributable to outstanding and ibnr claims which may not at that point of time be due and payable to us 
as a result of the application of derivative accounting rules under asc  the contract is treated as an asset and measured at the directors estimate of its fair value 
changes in the estimated fair value from time to time will be included in the consolidated statement of operations 
the contract is for a maximum of five years and provides cover for a named panel of reinsurers up to individual defined sub limits 
the contract does allow  subject to certain conditions  for substitution and replacement of panel members if our panel of reinsurers changes 
payments are made on a quarterly basis throughout the period of the contract based on the aggregate limit  which was set initially at million but is subject to adjustment 
as at december   the contract s aggregate limit was million 
reserving approach 
we are required by us gaap to establish loss reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses ultimate losses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers 
our loss reserves comprise the following components case reserves to cover the cost of claims that were reported to us but not yet paid  reserves for incurred but not reported ibnr claims to cover the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not reported  and a reserve for the expense associated with settling claims  including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process  known as loss adjustment expenses lae 
prior to the selection by management of the reserves to be included in our financial statements  our actuarial team employs a number of techniques to establish a range of estimates from which they consider it reasonable for management to select a best estimate the actuarial range 
case reserves 
for reported claims  reserves are established on a case by case basis within the parameters of coverage provided in the insurance policy or reinsurance agreement 
in estimating the cost of these claims  we consider circumstances related to the claims as reported  any information available from cedants  lawyers and loss adjustors and information on the cost of settling claims with similar characteristics in previous periods 
in addition  for significant events such as the and 
table of contents hurricanes  for example  the detailed analysis of our potential exposures includes information obtained directly from cedants which has yet to be processed through market systems enabling us to reduce the time lag between a significant event occurring and establishing case reserves 
this additional information is also incorporated into the analysis used to determine the actuarial ibnr 
reinsurance intermediaries are used to assist in obtaining and validating information from cedants but we establish all reserves 
in addition  we may engage loss adjusters and perform on site cedant audits to validate the information provided 
disputes do occur with cedants  but the number and frequency are generally low 
in the event of a dispute  intermediaries are used to try to resolve the dispute 
if a resolution cannot be reached  then the contracts typically provide for binding arbitration 
ibnr claims 
the need for ibnr reserves arises from time lags between when a loss occurs and when it is actually reported and settled 
by definition  we do not have specific information on ibnr claims so they need to be estimated by actuarial methodologies 
ibnr reserves are therefore generally calculated at an aggregate level and cannot generally be identified as reserves for a particular loss or contract 
we calculate ibnr reserves by line of business and by accident year within that line 
where appropriate  analyses may be conducted on sub sets of a line of business 
ibnr reserves are calculated by projecting our ultimate losses on each line of business and subtracting paid losses and case reserves 
sources of information 
claims information received typically includes the loss date  details of the claim  the recommended reserve and reports from the loss adjusters dealing with the claim 
in respect of pro rata treaties we receive regular statements bordereaux which provide paid and outstanding claims information  often with large losses separately identified 
following widely reported loss events such as natural catastrophes and airplane crashes we adopt a proactive approach to establish our likely exposure to claims by reviewing policy listings and contacting brokers and policyholders as appropriate 
actuarial methodologies 
the main projection methodologies that are used by our actuaries are initial expected loss ratio method this method calculates an estimate of ultimate losses by applying an estimated loss ratio to an estimate of ultimate earned premium for each accident year 
the estimated loss ratio is based on one or more of a an analysis of our own claims experience to date  b pricing information c industry data and d an analysis of a portfolio of similar business written by syndicate  as available  adjusted by an index reflecting how insurance rates  term and conditions have changed bornhuetter ferguson method the bf method uses as a starting point an assumed ielr and blends in the loss ratio  which is implied by the claims experience to date using benchmark loss development patterns on paid claims data paid bf or reported claims data reported bf 
although the method tends to provide less volatile indications at early stages of development and reflects changes in the external environment  it can be slow to react to emerging loss development and can  if the ielr proves to be inaccurate  produce loss estimates which take longer to converge with the final settlement value of loss 
loss development chain ladder method this method uses actual loss data and the historical development profiles on older accident years to project more recent  less developed years to their ultimate position 
exposure based method this method is used for specific large typically catastrophic events such as a major hurricane 
all exposure is identified and we work with known market information and information from our cedants to determine a percentage of the exposure to be taken as the ultimate loss 
in general terms  the ielr method is most appropriate for lines of business and or accident years where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet mature enough to modify our initial expectations of the ultimate loss ratios 
typical examples would be recent accident years for lines of business in the casualty reinsurance segment 
the bf method is generally appropriate where there are few reported claims and a relatively less stable pattern of reported losses 
typical examples would be our treaty risk excess line of business in our property reinsurance segment and marine hull line of business in 
table of contents our international insurance segment 
the chain ladder method is appropriate when there are relatively stable patterns of loss emergence and a relatively large number of reported claims 
typical examples are the uk commercial property and uk commercial liability lines of business in the international insurance segment 
reserving procedures and process 
our actuaries calculate the ielr  bf and chain ladder methods for each line of business and each accident year 
they then provide a range of ultimates within which management s best estimate is most likely to fall 
this range will usually reflect a blend of the various methodologies 
these methodologies do involve significant subjective judgments reflecting many factors such as changes in legislative conditions  changes in judicial interpretation of legal liability policy coverages and inflation 
our actuaries collaborate with underwriting  claims  legal and finance in identifying factors which are incorporated in their range of ultimates in which management s best estimate is most likely to fall 
the actuarial ranges are not intended to include the minimum or maximum amount that the claims may ultimately settle at  but are designed to provide management with ranges from which it is reasonable to select a single best estimate for inclusion in our financial statements 
there are no differences between our year end and our quarterly internal reserving procedures and processes in the sense that our actuaries perform the basic projections and analyses described above for each line of business 
selection of reported gross reserves 
management  through its reserve committee  then reviews the range of actuarial estimates  which to date it has not adjusted  and any other evidence before selecting its best estimate of reserves for each line of business and accident year 
management can select its best estimate outside the range provided by the actuaries 
this provides the basis for the recommendation made by management to the audit committee and board of directors regarding the reserve amounts to be recorded in the company s financial statements 
the reserve committee is a management committee consisting of the group chief risk officer  the group chief actuary  the group chief financial officer and senior members of our underwriting and claims staff 
each line of business is reviewed in detail by management  through its reserve committee  at least once a year  the timing of such reviews varies throughout the year 
additionally  for all lines of business  we review the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations every fiscal quarter 
if warranted from these loss emergence tests  we may accelerate the timing of our detailed actuarial reviews 
uncertainties 
while the management selected reserves make a reasonable provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense obligations  we note that the process of estimating required reserves does  by its very nature  involve uncertainty and therefore the ultimate claims may fall outside the actuarial range 
the level of uncertainty can be influenced by such factors as the existence of coverage with long duration reporting patterns and changes in claims handling practices  as well as the other factors described above 
because many of the coverages underwritten involve claims that may not be ultimately settled for many years after they are incurred  subjective judgments as to the ultimate exposure to losses are an integral and necessary component of the loss reserving process 
we review regularly our reserves  using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze current claims costs  frequency and severity data  and prevailing economic  social and legal factors 
reserves established in prior periods are adjusted as claims experience develops and new information becomes available 
estimates of ibnr are generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than estimates of the cost of settling claims already notified to us  where more information about the claim event is generally available 
ibnr claims often may not be apparent to the insured until many years after the event giving rise to the claims has happened 
lines of business where the ibnr proportion of the total reserve is high  such as liability insurance  will typically display greater variations between initial estimates and final outcomes because of the greater degree of difficulty of estimating these reserves 

table of contents lines of business where claims are typically reported relatively quickly after the claim event tend to display lower levels of volatility between initial estimates and final outcomes 
reinsurance claims are subject to a longer time lag both in their reporting and in their time to final settlement 
the time lag is a factor which is included in the projections to ultimate claims within the actuarial analyses and helps to explain why in general a higher proportion of the initial reinsurance reserves are represented by ibnr than for insurance reserves for business in the same class 
delays in receiving information from cedants are an expected part of normal business operations and are included within the statistical estimate of ibnr to the extent that current levels of backlog are consistent with historical data 
currently  there are no processing backlogs which would materially affect our financial statements 
allowance is made  however  for changes or uncertainties which may create distortions in the underlying statistics or which might cause the cost of unsettled claims to increase or reduce when compared with the cost of previously settled claims including changes in our processes which might accelerate or slow down the development and or recording of paid or incurred claims  changes in the legal environment including challenges to tort reform  the effects of inflation  changes in the mix of business  the impact of large losses  and changes in our cedants reserving methodologies 
these factors are incorporated in the recommended reserve range from which management selects its best point estimate 
as at december   a change in the gross reserve for ibnr losses would have equated to a change of approximately million in loss reserves which would represent of net income before income tax for the twelve months ended december  as at december   a change in the gross reserve for ibnr losses would have equated to a change of approximately million in loss reserves which would represent of net income before income tax for the twelve months ended december  there are specific areas of our selected reserves which have additional uncertainty associated with them 
in the property reinsurance segment there is still the potential for adverse development from litigation associated with hurricane katrina 
in the casualty reinsurance segment  there are additional uncertainties associated with claims emanating from the global financial crisis and the collapse of the madoff investment funds 
there is also a potential for new areas of claims to emerge as underlying this segment are many long tail lines of business 
in the international insurance segment  we wrote a book of financial institutions risks which have a number of notifications relating to the financial crisis in and in the us insurance segment a specific area of uncertainty relates to a book of new york contractor business 
in each case  management believe that they have selected an appropriate best estimate based on current information and current analyses 
loss reserving sensitivity analysis the most significant key assumptions identified in the reserving process are that the historic loss development and trend experience is assumed to be indicative of future loss development and trends  the information developed from internal and independent external sources can be used to develop meaningful estimates of the initial expected ultimate loss ratios  and no significant losses or types of losses will emerge that are not represented in either the initial expected loss ratios or the historical development patterns 
the selected best estimate of reserves is typically in excess of the mean of the actuarial reserve estimates 
the company believes that there is potentially significant risk in estimating loss reserves for long tail lines of business and for immature accident years that may not be adequately captured through traditional actuarial projection methodologies 
as discussed above  these methodologies usually rely heavily on projections of prior year trends into the future 
in selecting its best estimate of future 
table of contents liabilities  the company considers both the results of actuarial point estimates of loss reserves as well as the potential variability of these estimates as captured by a reasonable range of actuarial reserve estimates 
in determining the appropriate best estimate  the company reviews i the position of overall reserves within the actuarial reserve range  ii the result of bottom up analysis by accident year reflecting the impact of parameter uncertainty in actuarial calculations  and iii specific qualitative information on events that may have an effect on future claims but which may not have been adequately reflected in actuarial mid point estimates  such as the potential for outstanding litigation or claims practices of cedants to have an adverse impact 
in order to show the potential variability in the company s estimate of loss reserves  the internal actuaries use stochastic modeling techniques around their mean estimate 
we believe that stochastic modeling provides a distribution against which selected reserves can be assessed for which we show the probability of various outcomes relative to the actuarial mean estimate 
stochastic modeling provides a range of potential outcomes as reserve movements will be caused by any number of factors  and as such it is unlikely that only one factor will change in a given period  stochastic modeling techniques will reflect the impact from many factors 
the output from the stochastic modeling is more meaningful at a segmental level and is therefore not provided at a line of business level 
we show in the following table  the th percentile  th percentile  actuarial mean estimate  th percentile and th percentile together with the actual percentile that the selected loss reserves represent 
actuarial range of gross reserves 
the following table sets out the actuarial range of gross reserves for each of our segments and compares it to management s selected best estimate as at december  as at december  management s selected gross reserves reserve percentile th th mean th th in million  except for percentages property reinsurance casualty reinsurance international insurance us insurance diversification total gross losses and loss expense reserves the above represents a distribution from our internal capital model for reserving risk based upon our current state of knowledge and application of actuarial principles 
the model itself has many explicit and implicit assumptions relating to the incurred pattern of claims  the expected ultimate settlement amount  inflation and dependencies between lines of business 
if any of these assumptions underlying the model were to prove incorrect then a materially different reserving distribution may result 
the th percentile represents a in chance that  for example  the property reinsurance reserves will be at or lower than million 
the th percentile represents a in chance that reserves will be at or greater than million 
diversification reflects the fact that not all the segments are perfectly correlated  that is  we would not expect all lines of business to run off better than or worse than the mean at the same time 
if the ultimate liabilities equate to the mean actuarial estimate  then the impact from the change in loss reserves would be to increase net income before tax by million being the difference above between the selected loss reserves of  million and the mean value of  million  although the impact of such a change is unlikely to be recognized in one calendar year due to the unwinding of experience against expectations taking many years 

table of contents conversely if the ultimate liabilities equate to the estimated th percentile  then the impact from the change in loss reserves would be to reduce net income before tax by million being the difference above between the selected loss reserves of  million and the th percentile value of  million  although the impact of such a change is again unlikely to be recognized in one calendar year 
changes in loss reserve estimates would not have an immediate effect on our liquidity as settlement of insurance liabilities typically can take a number of years 
however  please see item  management s discussion and analysis liquidity for a discussion of liquidity risks 
actuarial range of net reserves 
in determining the range of net reserves  we estimate recoveries due under our proportional and excess of loss reinsurance programs 
for proportional reinsurance we apply the appropriate cession percentages to estimate how much of the gross reserves will be collectable 
for excess of loss recoveries  individual large losses are modeled through our reinsurance program 
an assessment is also made of the collectability of reinsurance recoveries taking into account market data on the financial strength of each of the reinsurance companies 
the net actuarial range for reserves for losses and loss expenses assuming that net reserves move in proportion to gross would be between  million at the th percentile and  million at the th percentile 
the actual net reserves established as at december  were  million 
investments 
we currently classify all except million of our fixed maturity investments and short term investments as available for sale and  accordingly  they are carried at estimated fair value 
the company uses quoted values and other data provided by internationally recognized independent pricing sources as inputs into its process for determining the fair value of its fixed income investments 
where multiple quotes or prices are obtained  a price source hierarchy is maintained in order to determine which price source provides the fair value ie  a price obtained from a pricing service with more seniority in the hierarchy will be used over a less senior one in all cases 
the hierarchy prioritizes pricing services based on availability and reliability and assigns the highest priority to index providers 
for mortgage backed and other asset backed debt securities  fair value includes estimates regarding prepayment assumptions  which are based on current market conditions 
amortized cost in relation to these securities is calculated using a constant effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and estimated economic lives of the securities 
when actual prepayments differ significantly from anticipated prepayments  the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date 
changes in estimated yield are recorded on a retrospective basis  which result in future cash flows being used to determine current book value 
see additional information below under valuation of investments 
other than temporary impairment in investments 
our process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors 
these primary factors include i the time period during which there has been a significant decline in value  ii an analysis of the liquidity  business prospects and financial condition of the issuer  iii the significance of the decline  iv an analysis of the collateral structure and other credit support  as applicable  of the securities in question  v expected future interest rate movements  and vi our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time for the value to recover 
in addition  accounting standards require that other than temporary impairments for certain asset backed and mortgage backed securities are recognized if the fair value of the security is less than its cost or amortized cost and there has been a decrease in the present value of the expected cash flows since the last reporting period 
where our analysis of the above factors results in our conclusion that declines in fair values are other than temporary  the cost of the security is written down to fair value and the previously unrealized loss is therefore considered realized in the period such determination is made 
deferred tax assets 
we provide for income taxes for our subsidiaries operating in income tax paying jurisdictions 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from the net tax effect of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our audited consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction 

table of contents at each balance sheet date  management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction and available tax planning strategies 
estimates of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions that may differ from actual experience 
differences in our assumptions and resulting estimates could be material and have an adverse impact on our financial results of operations and liquidity 
any such differences are recorded in the period in which they become known 
results of operations our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap

the increase in gross written premium in compared to was due to several factors including the contribution from new underwriting teams established in the international insurance segment and favorable premium adjustments in our property and casualty reinsurance segments 
gross written premiums in our casualty reinsurance segment were also reduced in due to the closure of our marlton  new jersey office and relocation of our facultative business to rocky hill  connecticut  and a change in our underwriting approach

gross premiums earned reflect the portion of gross written premiums which are recorded as revenues over the policy periods of the risks we write 
therefore  the earned premium recorded in any year includes premium from policies incepting in prior years and excludes premium to be earned subsequent to the balance sheet date 
gross premiums earned in were million higher than in reflecting the increase in written premiums in our property reinsurance and us insurance segments and due to the gross premium written by the new underwriting

underwriting results by operating segments management measures segment results on the basis of the combined ratio  which is obtained by dividing the sum of the losses and loss expenses  acquisition expenses and operating and administrative expenses by net premiums earned 
indirect operating and administrative expenses are allocated to segments based on each segment s proportional share of gross earned premiums

treaty reinsurance contracts provide for automatic coverage of a type or category of risk underwritten by our ceding clients 
in facultative reinsurance  the reinsurer assumes all or part of a risk written by the insurer in a single insurance contract 
facultative reinsurance is negotiated separately for each contract 

table of contents facultative reinsurance is normally purchased by insurers where individual risks are not covered by their reinsurance treaties  for amounts in excess of the dollar limits of their reinsurance treaties or for unusual risks 
we also underwrite facultative automatics where all original risks that meet certain contractual criteria are covered under the same reinsurance contract 
there is typically a different type of underwriting expertise required in facultative underwriting as compared to treaty underwriting

the reduction in gross written premium in compared to reflected the softening market conditions for this segment through the period prior to the september hurricanes  increased competition and the non renewal of a number of accounts that no longer met our internal profitability requirements 
these premium reductions were partially offset by the recognition of million of reinstatement premiums following hurricanes ike and gustav and favorable prior year estimated premium adjustments for the treaty risk excess  treaty pro rata and property facultative business lines 
the reduction in gross written premiums in the property reinsurance segment in was principally due to softening rates  in particular in our risk excess line of business  unfavorable pricing and market conditions and the non renewal of several large contracts which did not meet our pricing conditions 
reinsurance ceded

policy acquisition expenses reduced by million in compared to due to the reduction in written premiums 
the acquisition expense ratio also decreased in compared to due to the reduction in ceded earned premiums in the year as we continued to reduce our reliance on reinsurance in such year

valuation of investments valuation of fixed income and short term available for sale investments and fixed income and short term trading investments 
we use quoted values and other data provided by internationally recognized independent pricing sources as inputs into our process for determining the fair value of our fixed income investments 
where multiple quotes or prices are obtained  a price source hierarchy is maintained in order to determine which price source provides the fair value ie  a price obtained from a pricing service with more seniority in the hierarchy will be used over a less senior one in all cases 
the 
table of contents hierarchy prioritizes pricing services based on availability and reliability and assigns the highest priority to index providers 
we consider prices for actively traded treasury securities to be derived based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets  which are level inputs in the fair value hierarchy 
we consider prices for other securities priced via vendors  indices  or broker dealers to be derived based on inputs that are observable for the asset  either directly or indirectly  which are level inputs in the fair value hierarchy 
we consider securities  other financial instruments and derivative insurance contracts subject to fair value measurement whose valuation is derived by internal valuation models to be based largely on unobservable inputs  which are level inputs in the fair value hierarchy 
there have been no changes in our use of valuation techniques during the year 
pricing services and index providers 
pricing services provide pricing for less complex  liquid securities based on market quotations in active markets 
for securities that do not trade on a listed exchange  these pricing services may use matrix pricing consisting of observable market inputs to estimate the fair value of a security 
these observable market inputs include reported trades  benchmark yields  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers  reference data  and industry and economic factors 
additionally  pricing services may use a valuation model such as an option adjusted spread model commonly used for estimating fair values of mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
broker dealers 
for the most part  we obtain quotes directly from broker dealers who are active in the corresponding markets when prices are unavailable from independent pricing services or index providers 
generally  broker dealers value securities through their trading desks based on observable market inputs 
their pricing methodologies include mapping securities based on trade data  bids or offers  observed spreads and performance on newly issued securities 
they may also establish pricing through observing secondary trading of similar securities 
quotes from broker dealers are non binding 
to validate the techniques or models used by third party pricing sources  we review process  in conjunction with the processes completed by the third party accounting service provider  include  but are not limited to quantitative analysis eg  comparing the quarterly return for each managed portfolio to its target benchmark  with significant differences identified and investigated  initial and ongoing evaluation of methodologies used by outside parties to calculate fair value  and  comparison of the fair value estimates to its knowledge of the current market 
prices obtained from brokers and pricing services are not adjusted by us  however  prices provided by a broker or pricing service in certain instances may be challenged based on market or information available from internal sources  including those available to our third party investment accounting service provider 
subsequent to any challenge  revisions made by the broker or pricing service to the quotes are supplied to our investment accounting service provider 
at december   we obtained an average of quotes per investment  compared to quotes at december  pricing sources used in pricing our fixed income investments at december  and december   respectively  were as follows twelve months ended twelve months ended december  december  index providers pricing services broker dealers total 
table of contents valuation of other investments 
the value of our investments in funds of hedge funds was based upon monthly net asset values reported by the underlying funds to our funds of hedge fund managers 
the financial statements of our funds of hedge funds were subject to annual audits evaluating the net asset positions of the underlying investments 
we periodically reviewed the performance of our funds of hedge funds and evaluated the reasonableness of the valuations 
the value of our investment in cartesian iris a lp is based on our shares of the capital position of the partnership which includes income and expenses reported by the limited partnership as provided in its quarterly management accounts 
cartesian iris a lp is subject to annual audit evaluating the financial statements of the partnership 
we periodically review the management accounts of cartesian iris a lp and evaluate the reasonableness of the valuation of our investment 
guaranteed investments 
the following table presents the breakdown of investments which are guaranteed by mono line insurers wrapped credit disclosure and those that have explicit government guarantees 
the standalone rating is determined as the senior unsecured debt rating of the issuer 
where the credit ratings were split between the three main rating agencies s p s  moody s  and fitch  the lowest rating was used

our exposure to other third party guaranteed debt is primarily to investments backed by the federal depository insurance corporation fdic and non us government guaranteed issuers 
other than temporary impairment 
we review all of our fixed maturities for potential impairment each quarter based on criteria including issuer specific circumstances  credit ratings actions and general macro economic conditions 
the process of determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary requires considerable judgment 
as part of the assessment process we also evaluate whether it is more likely than not that we will sell any fixed maturity security in an unrealized loss position before its market value recovers to amortized cost 
once a security has been identified as other than temporarily impaired  the amount of any impairment included in net income is determined by reference to that portion of the unrealized loss that is considered to be credit related 
non credit related unrealized losses are included in other comprehensive income

gross reserves for the casualty reinsurance segment have continued to increase reflecting the build up of long tail exposures 
international insurance reserves have increased by due to the recognition of reserves associated with the global financial crisis  aviation losses and the reserves associated with new business lines 
the reserves for us insurance have increased reflecting additional hurricane wilma losses and deterioration on the new york contractors liability account 
prior year loss reserves 
in the twelve months ended december   and  there was an overall reduction of our estimate of the ultimate claims to be paid 
an analysis of this reduction by segment is as follows twelve months ended twelve months ended twelve months ended business segment december  december  december  in millions property reinsurance casualty reinsurance international insurance us insurance total reduction in prior year loss reserves for the twelve months ended december  the analysis of the development by each segment is as follows property reinsurance the reserve release in the year were as a result of better than expected incurred development on all lines in the segment spread across several accident years and including settlement of hurricane ike and gustav claims 
because of ongoing litigation  there remains significant uncertainty as to our ultimate costs of hurricane katrina 
casualty reinsurance the million of reserve releases in our casualty reinsurance segment were mainly attributable to favorable development in our us casualty treaty reinsurance business line where the experience to year end compared with starting loss ratios and expected patterns has generally been better than expected at the aggregate level 
international insurance the million release in the year was the result of reserve releases across the majority of lines compensating for reserve strengthening from the financial institutions and marine  energy and construction liability lines 
the reserve strengthening was attributable to increased reserves on the financial institutions line in response to the global financial crisis and a deterioration on the accident year due to worse than expected incurred claims development in our marine  energy and construction liability line of business 
us insurance 
the million deterioration was due to worse than expected experience from the casualty insurance line particularly in relation to new york contractors liability business 

table of contents for the twelve months ended december  the analysis of the development by each segment is as follows property reinsurance the million reserve release in this segment was predominantly due to favorable development on the catastrophe line of business 
the most significant elements related to reductions in loss estimates for the uk floods and estimated recoveries from enforcing subrogation rights in respect of california wildfires 
casualty reinsurance 
the million of reserve releases in our casualty reinsurance segment are mainly attributable to favorable development in our us casualty treaty and international casualty treaty reinsurance business which contributed million and million  respectively 
for both us and international casualty  where claims may take several years to emerge  the experience to date compared with starting loss ratios and expected patterns has generally been better than expected at the aggregate level 
additional releases occurred from commutations of certain contracts 
international insurance 
the international insurance segment has been impacted by million of net reserve strengthening during the reserve strengthening was attributable to deterioration in respect of a loss related to the california wildfires and also from shipowners liability losses  both written in our marine  energy and construction liability account 
this was partially offset by favorable development in our uk commercial property and liability lines 
us insurance 
the million prior year release was due to better than expected experience primarily in the property line of business 
for the twelve months ended december  the analysis of the development by each segment is as follows property reinsurance 
property reinsurance deteriorated by million in  approximately million of which was attributable to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
the methodology used to determine the hurricanes ultimate losses was to review each cedant s position with respect to its reported claims and establish an expected ibnr utilizing information from that client 
in setting our loss estimates for hurricane katrina  we had taken account of evolving litigation relating to coverage and quantum issues and included additional provisions where appropriate 
because of ongoing litigation  there remains uncertainty as to our ultimate costs of hurricane katrina 
casualty reinsurance 
the lines contributing to the casualty reinsurance reserves release of million were million attributed to international casualty  million to us casualty offset by million of reserve strengthening for casualty facultative and structured business 
although claims in these lines may take several years to emerge  the experience to date compared with our starting loss ratios and expected patterns have generally been better than expected at the aggregate level for the us and international casualty lines 
international insurance 
the international insurance reserves release was million  spread across several lines of which the largest contributor was uk commercial liability which accounted for million of releases 
this reduction was attributable mainly to a reduction in the uncertainty surrounding the initial case reserving methodology and continued favorable loss experience 
most other lines exhibited releases of between million and million with the exception of marine  energy and construction liability which deteriorated by million 
us insurance 
this segment had a million release driven largely by the casualty account 
this was due to the recognition of some favorable experience to date on the account 
other than the matters described above  we did not make any significant changes in assumptions used in our reserving process 
however  because the period of time we have been in operation is relatively short  our loss experience is limited and reliable evidence of changes in trends of numbers of claims incurred  average settlement amounts  numbers of claims outstanding and average losses per claim will necessarily take years to develop

at december   this ratio was  
our preference shares are classified in our balance sheet as equity but may receive a different treatment in some cases under the capital adequacy assessments made by certain rating agencies 
such securities are often referred to as hybrids as they have certain attributes of both debt and equity 
we also monitor the ratio of the total of debt and hybrids to total capital and this stands at as of december  
the principal capital management transactions during and early were as follows on march   we repurchased and cancelled  of our liquidation value preference shares nyse ahl pa at a price of per share 
the repurchase resulted in a million gain attributable to ordinary shareholders which was not recognized in the income statement but was included in the calculation of earnings per share 
on february   our board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for up to million of ordinary shares 
the authorization covers the period to march  access to capital 
our business operations are in part dependent on our financial strength and the market s perception thereof  as measured by shareholders equity  which was  million at december   million 
we believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds through debt or equity financing 
however  our continuing ability to access the capital markets is dependent on  among other things  market conditions  our operating results and our perceived financial strength 
we regularly monitor our capital and financial position  as well as investment and security market conditions  both in general and with respect to aspen holdings securities 
our ordinary shares and all our preference shares are listed on the new york stock exchange 
on december   we filed an unlimited shelf registration statement for the issuance and sale of securities from time to time

management monitors the liquidity of aspen holdings and of each of its insurance subsidiaries and arranges credit facilities to enhance short term liquidity resources on a stand by basis 
holding company 
we monitor the ability of aspen holdings to service debt  to finance dividend payments to ordinary and preference shareholders and to provide financial support to the insurance subsidiaries 

table of contents as at december  and  aspen holdings held million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents which  taken together with dividends declared or expected to be declared by subsidiary companies and our credit facilities  management considered sufficient to provide aspen holdings liquidity at such time

for a more detailed discussion of our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  see note of our financial statements 
insurance subsidiaries 
as of december   the insurance subsidiaries held approximately million million in cash and short term investments that are readily realizable securities 
management monitors the value  currency and duration of cash and investments held by its insurance subsidiaries to ensure that they are able to meet their insurance and other liabilities as they become due and was satisfied that there was a comfortable margin of liquidity as at december  and for the foreseeable future 
on an ongoing basis  our insurance subsidiaries sources of funds primarily consist of premiums written  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments 
cash is used primarily to pay reinsurance premiums  losses and loss adjustment expenses  brokerage commissions  general and administrative expenses  taxes  interest  dividends and to purchase new investments 
the potential for individual large claims and for accumulations of claims from single events means that substantial and unpredictable payments may need to be made within relatively short periods of time 
we manage these risks by making regular forecasts of the timing and amount of expected cash outflows and ensuring that we maintain sufficient balances in cash and short term investments to meet these estimates 
notwithstanding this policy  if these cash flow forecasts are incorrect  we could be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity  potentially at a significant loss 
historically  we have not had to liquidate investments to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity 
the liquidity of the insurance subsidiaries is also affected by the terms of contractual obligations to us policyholders and by undertakings to certain regulatory authorities to facilitate the issue of letters of credit or maintain certain balances in trust funds for the benefit of policyholders

letters of credit facility

table of contents as at december  we had million of outstanding collateralized letters of credit under this facility 
on october   aspen uk and aspen bermuda entered into a million secured letter of credit facility with barclays bank plc 
all letters of credit issued under the facility will be used to support reinsurance obligations of the parties to the agreement and their respective subsidiaries 
we had million of outstanding collateralized letters of credit under this facility as at december  contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations other than our obligations to employees  our perpetual piers and our perpetual preference shares under long term debt  operating leases and reserves relating to insurance and reinsurance contracts as of december  contractual basis payments due by period in millions less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations long term debt obligations reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses the long term debt obligations disclosed above does not include the million annual interest payable on our outstanding senior notes 
in estimating the time intervals into which payments of our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses fall  as set out above  we have utilized actuarially assessed payment patterns 
by the nature of the insurance and reinsurance contracts under which these liabilities are assumed  there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods shown and there could be a material acceleration or deceleration of claims payments depending on factors outside our control 
this uncertainty is heightened by the relatively short time in which we have operated  thereby providing limited company specific claims loss payment patterns 
the total amount of payments in respect of our reserves  as well as the timing of such payments  may differ materially from our current estimates for the reasons set out above under critical accounting policies reserves for losses and loss expenses

off balance sheet arrangements ajax re was a variable interest entity under the guidance contained in asc consolidations 
we had a variable interest in the entity  however we were not the primary beneficiary of the entity and therefore we were not required to consolidate its results into our consolidated financial statements 
for further details on the ajax re transactions please see note to the audited financial statements for the twelve months ended december  included elsewhere in this report 
we are not party to any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an affiliated entity unconsolidated with us is a party  other than that noted above with ajax re  that management believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
ajax re provides us with california earthquake coverage based on modified industry losses  or indexed based losses  with an attachment level of billion and an exhaustion level of billion 
the indexed based losses are derived from industry personal lines losses  commercial lines losses and automobile losses  each as calculated by pcs 
we would recover up to million on a linear basis if we incurred losses in such earthquake 
the insurance cover expires on may  in order to ensure that ajax re had sufficient funding to service the libor portion of interest due on the bonds issued by ajax re  ajax re entered into a total return swap with lehman financing  whereby lehman financing directed ajax re to invest the proceeds from the bonds into permitted investments 
lehman brothers also provided a guarantee of lehman financing s obligations under the swap 
on september   lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy  which is a termination event under the swap 
ajax re terminated the swap on september  as a result  without the benefit of the total return swap  the extent of the actual reinsurance cover in the event of a california earthquake provided by ajax re will be limited to the market value of the collateral held by ajax re  that in light of current financial market conditions  we expect the market value of this collateral is substantially less than the million of original reinsurance cover 
nevertheless  we remained within our risk tolerances without the benefit of this reinsurance cover

effects of inflation inflation may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations by its effect on interest rates and on the cost of settling claims 
the potential exists  after a catastrophe or other large property loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy as the demand for services such as construction typically surges 
we believe this had an impact on the cost of claims arising from the hurricanes 
the cost of settling claims may also be increased by global commodity price inflation 
we 
table of contents seek to take both these factors into account when setting reserves for any events where we think they may be material 
our calculation of reserves for losses and loss expenses in respect of casualty business includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
we write casualty business in the united states  the united kingdom and australia and certain other territories  where claims inflation has in many years run at higher rates than general inflation 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims  we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in earnings 
the actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
in addition to general price inflation we are exposed to a persisting long term upwards trend in the cost of judicial awards for damages 
we seek to take this into account in our pricing and reserving of casualty business 
we also seek to take into account the projected impact of inflation on the likely actions of central banks in the setting of short term interest rates and consequent effects on the yields and prices of fixed interest securities 
as of february  we consider that although inflation is currently low  in the medium term there is a risk that inflation  interest rates and bond yields will rise with the result that the market value of certain of our fixed interest investments may reduce 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures as at december  as at december  in millions  except percentages share capital  additional paid in capital and retained income and accumulated other comprehensive income attributable to ordinary shareholders average adjustment average equity average equity  a non gaap financial measure  is calculated by the arithmetic average on a monthly basis for the stated periods excluding i preference shares  ii after tax unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments and iii the average after tax unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses 
unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments is primarily the result of interest rate movements and the resultant impact on fixed income securities  and unrealized appreciation depreciation on foreign exchange is the result of exchange rate movements between the us dollar and the british pound 
therefore  aspen believes that excluding these unrealized appreciations depreciations provides a more consistent and useful measurement of operating performance  which supplements gaap information 
as at december  as at december  in millions  except percentages net income after tax add deduct after tax income net realized and unrealized investment gains losses net realized and unrealized exchange gains losses operating income after tax operating income  a non gaap financial measure  is an internal performance measure used by us in the management of our operations and represents after tax operational results excluding  as applicable  after tax net realized capital gains or losses  after tax net foreign exchange gains or losses and after tax 
table of contents gains or losses from our investments in funds of hedge funds 
we exclude after tax net realized capital gains or losses and after tax net foreign exchange gains or losses and after tax gains from our calculation of operating income because the amount of these gains or losses is heavily influenced by  and fluctuates in part  according to the availability of market opportunities 
we believe these amounts are largely independent of its business and underwriting process and including them distorts the analysis of trends in its operations 
in addition to presenting net income determined in accordance with gaap  we believe that showing operating income enables investors  analysts  rating agencies and other users of our financial information to more easily analyze our results of operations in a manner similar to how management analyzes our underlying business performance 
operating income should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap net income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company believes that it is principally exposed to four types of market risk interest rate risk  equity risk  foreign currency risk and credit risk 
interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income securities 
accordingly  our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income portfolio falls  and the converse is also true 
we expect to manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity taking into account the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of aspen uk s  aspen bermuda s and aspen specialty s insurance and reinsurance liabilities 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk also includes maintaining a high quality portfolio with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value 
the portfolio is actively managed and trades are made to balance our exposure to interest rates 
as at december   our fixed income portfolio had an approximate duration of years 
the table below depicts interest rate change scenarios and the effect on our available for sale and trading assets effect of changes in interest rates on portfolio given a parallel shift in the yield curve movement in rates in basis points in millions  except percentages market value gain loss percentage of portfolio corresponding percentage at december  value at risk var 
we measure var for our portfolio at the confidence level on two different bases that place lower short var or higher long var weights on historical market observations 
at the end of december our short var was and our long var was equity risk 
we had invested in two funds of hedge funds where the underlying hedge funds consisted of diverse strategies and securities 
in february  we gave notice to redeem our remaining investments in funds of hedge funds with effect on june   which would reduce our exposure to equity risk 
as the notices of redemption have taken effect  we are no longer exposed to changes in the net asset value of the funds 
foreign currency risk 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
the functional currencies of our segments are us dollars  british pounds  euros  swiss francs  australian dollars and singaporean dollars 
as of december   approximately of our cash and investments was held in us dollars  approximately were in british pounds and approximately 
table of contents were in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound 
for the twelve months ended december   of our gross premiums were written in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound and we expect that a similar proportion will be written in currencies other than the us dollar and the british pound in other foreign currency amounts are remeasured to the appropriate functional currency and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are reflected in the statement of operations 
functional currency amounts of assets and liabilities are then translated into us dollars 
the unrealized gain or loss from this translation  net of tax  is recorded as part of ordinary shareholders equity 
the change in unrealized foreign currency translation gain or loss during the year  net of tax  is a component of comprehensive income 
both the remeasurement and translation are calculated using current exchange rates for the balance sheets and average exchange rates for the statement of operations 
we may experience exchange losses to the extent that our foreign currency exposure is not properly managed or otherwise hedged  which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
management estimates that a change in the exchange rate between british pounds and us dollars as at december   would have impacted reported net comprehensive income by approximately million million 
we will continue to manage our foreign currency risk by seeking to match our liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in these currencies 
this may involve the use of forward exchange contracts from time to time 
a forward foreign currency exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specified currency at a future date at a price set at the time of the contract 
foreign currency exchange contracts will not eliminate fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but rather allow us to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time 
all realized gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in the statement of operations 
as at december   the company held currency contracts to purchase nil of us and foreign currencies million 
credit risk 
we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories  business sectors and any one issuer 
as at december   the average rate of fixed income securities in our investment portfolio was aa  compared to aa at december  in addition  we are exposed to the credit risk of our insurance and reinsurance brokers to whom we make claims payments for our policyholders  as well as to the credit risk of our reinsurers and retrocessionaires who assume business from us 
other than fully collateralized reinsurance  the substantial majority of our reinsurers have a rating of a excellent  the third highest of fifteen rating levels  or better by am best and the minimum rating of any of our material reinsurers is a excellent  the fourth highest of fifteen rating levels  by am best 
we have also entered into a credit insurance contract which  subject to its terms  insures us against losses due to the inability of one or more of our reinsurance counterparties to meet their financial obligations to the company 
payments are made on a quarterly basis throughout the period of the contract based on the aggregate limit  which was set initially at million but subject to adjustment had a value of million as at december  the carrying value of the derivative is the company s maximum exposure to loss 

table of contents the table below shows our reinsurance recoverables as of december   and our reinsurers ratings taking into account any changes in ratings as of february  am best in millions a a a a fully collateralized not rated
