item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this form k 
it contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
please see note on forward looking statements and risk factors for more information 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an international insurance company focusing on specialty products within the overall property casualty insurance market 
our largest product line and most long standing area of specialization is ocean marine insurance 
we have also developed specialty niches in professional liability insurance and in specialty liability insurance primarily consisting of contractors liability and primary and excess casualty coverages 
our revenue is primarily comprised of premiums and investment income 
we derive our premiums primarily from business written by wholly owned underwriting management companies which produce  manage and underwrite insurance and reinsurance for us 
our products are distributed through multiple channels  utilizing global  national and regional retail and wholesale insurance brokers 
we conduct operations through our insurance companies and our lloyd s operations segments 
the insurance companies segment consists of navigators insurance company  which includes a united kingdom branch the uk branch  and navigators specialty insurance company  which underwrites specialty and professional liability insurance on an excess and surplus lines basis 
all of the insurance business written by navigators specialty insurance company is fully reinsured by navigators insurance company pursuant to a quota share reinsurance agreement 
our lloyd s operations segment includes navigators underwriting agency ltd 
nual  a lloyd s of london lloyd s underwriting agency which manages lloyd s syndicate syndicate 
our lloyd s operations primarily underwrite marine and related lines of business along with offshore energy  professional liability insurance and construction coverages for onshore energy business at lloyd s through syndicate we controlled of syndicate s stamp capacity for the and underwriting years through our wholly owned subsidiary  navigators corporate underwriters ltd  and through both millennium underwriting ltd  another wholly owned subsidiary  and navigators corporate underwriters ltd 
in  which are referred to as corporate names in the lloyd s market 
we have also established underwriting agencies in antwerp  belgium  stockholm  sweden and copenhagen  denmark  which underwrite risks pursuant to binding authorities with nual into syndicate effective in  we reclassified certain business lines within our segments  which had no effect on the segment classifications of the insurance companies and lloyd s operations 
underwriting data for prior periods has been reclassified to reflect these changes 
the offshore energy business  formerly included in the marine and energy businesses of the insurance companies and lloyd s operations  is now included in the insurance companies and lloyd s operations property casualty businesses 
the marine lines within both the insurance companies and lloyd s operations are now presented as marine instead of marine and energy  since the offshore energy business has now been reclassified to property casualty 
engineering and construction  european property and other run off business  formerly included in the other category of business within the insurance companies and lloyd s operations  are now included under property casualty 
the middle markets business  formerly broken out separately in the insurance companies  is now included in the insurance companies property casualty business 

table of contents while management takes into consideration a wide range of factors in planning our business strategy and evaluating results of operations  there are certain factors that management believes are fundamental to understanding how we are managed 
first  underwriting profit is consistently emphasized as a primary goal  above premium growth 
management s assessment of our trends and potential growth in underwriting profit is the dominant factor in its decisions with respect to whether or not to expand a business line  enter into a new niche  product or territory or  conversely  to contract capacity in any business line 
in addition  management focuses on controlling the costs of our operations 
management believes that careful monitoring of the costs of existing operations and assessment of costs of potential growth opportunities are important to our profitability 
access to capital also has a significant impact on management s outlook for our operations 
the insurance companies operations and ability to grow their business and take advantage of market opportunities are constrained by regulatory capital requirements and rating agency assessments of capital adequacy 
management s decisions are also greatly influenced by access to specialized underwriting and claims expertise in our lines of business 
we have chosen to operate in specialty niches with certain common characteristics which we believe provide us with the opportunity to use our technical underwriting expertise in order to realize underwriting profit 
as a result  we have focused on underserved markets for businesses characterized by higher severity and low frequency of loss where we believe our intellectual capital and financial strength bring meaningful value 
in contrast  we have avoided niches that we believe have a high frequency of loss activity and or are subject to a high level of regulatory requirements  such as workers compensation and personal automobile insurance  because we do not believe our technical expertise is of as much value in these types of businesses 
examples of niches that have the characteristics we look for include bluewater hull which provides coverage for physical damage to  for example  highly valued cruise ships  and directors and officers liability d o insurance which covers litigation exposure of a corporation s directors and officers 
these types of exposures require substantial technical expertise 
we attempt to mitigate the financial impact of severe claims on our results by conservative and detailed underwriting  prudent use of reinsurance and a balanced portfolio of risks 
our total gross written premiums declined in primarily due to several factors our construction liability lines decreased due to both a decline in demand resulting from current economic conditions as well as increased competition due to new entrants into the market 
a decline in our offshore energy lines primarily resulting from a planned reduction in our gulf of mexico exposure as market pricing and terms did not meet our underwriting standards 
partially offsetting these factors were a increase in our d o insurance lines due to continued expansion of this business 
improved pricing conditions across the majority of our lines of business  resulting in an overall increase in average renewal rates 
pricing conditions have stabilized after experiencing declines across all of our lines in and were driven by a flight to quality after the market turmoil at the end of in  we decreased our use of quota share reinsurance and expanded our use of excess of loss reinsurance 
this change in the mix of our reinsurance resulted in an increase in our retention in  which translated into higher net written premiums and net earned premiums in compared to our net investment income declined in our pre tax average investment yield declined to from in resulting from lower short term yields 
our total investment portfolio continued to increase in and had exceeded billion at the end of we experienced significantly lower investment impairments in our portfolio in as the financial markets experienced a period of stability compared to the second half of 
table of contents our overall loss ratio of for increased compared to due primarily to a million decline in net prior year savings 
although we continued to realize prior year savings in our contractors liability lines  we experienced unfavorable prior year development in our d o and lawyers lines relating to unfavorable development in the and through underwriting years  respectively 
additional unfavorable prior year development in our insurance company marine liability lines resulted in a underwriting loss in both the marine and professional liability divisions within the insurance companies segment 
the discussions that follow include tables that contain both our consolidated and segment operating results for the last three calendar years 
in presenting our financial results  we have discussed our performance with reference to underwriting profit or loss and the related combined ratio  both of which are non gaap measures of underwriting profitability 
we consider such measures  which may be defined differently by other companies  to be important in the understanding of our overall results of operations 
underwriting profit or loss is calculated from net earned premium  less the sum of net losses and lae  commission expense  other operating expenses and commission income and other income expense 
the combined ratio is derived by dividing the sum of net losses and lae  commission expense  other operating expenses and commission income and other income expense by net earned premium 
a combined ratio of less than indicates an underwriting profit and over indicates an underwriting loss 
for additional information regarding our business  see business overview  included herein 
critical accounting policies it is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial statements 
management considers certain of these policies to be critical to the presentation of the financial results  since they require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures at the financial reporting date and throughout the reporting period 
certain of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates  which would be reflected in future periods 
our most critical accounting policies involve the reporting of the reserves for losses and lae including losses that have occurred but were not reported to us by the financial reporting date  reinsurance recoverables  written and unearned premium  the recoverability of deferred tax assets  the impairment of investment securities and accounting for lloyd s results 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses represent an estimate of the expected cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of losses  based on facts and circumstances then known 
actuarial methodologies are employed to assist in establishing such estimates and include judgments relative to estimates of future claims severity and frequency  length of time to develop to ultimate  judicial theories of liability and other third party factors which are often beyond our control 
no assurance can be given that actual claims made and related payments will not be in excess of the amounts reserved 
during the loss settlement period  it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim either upward or downward 
even after such adjustments  ultimate liability may exceed or be less than the revised estimates 
the numerous factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves include interpreting loss development activity  emerging economic and social trends  inflation  changes in the regulatory and judicial environment and changes in our operations  including changes in underwriting standards and claims handling procedures 
the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it must take into account many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events 
as a result  informed subjective judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process 

table of contents our actuaries generally calculate the ibnr loss reserves for each line of business by underwriting year for major products principally using two standard actuarial methodologies which are projection or extrapolation techniques the loss ratio method and the bornheutter ferguson method 
the loss ratio method is used to calculate the ibnr for the two most current underwriting years while the bornheutter ferguson method is used to calculate the ibnr for all prior underwriting years  except as otherwise described below 
such methodologies are supplemented in most instances by the loss development method and the frequency severity method which are used to analyze and better comprehend loss development patterns and trends in the data when making selections and judgments under the loss ratio method and the bornheutter ferguson method 
in utilizing these methodologies  each of which is generally applicable to both long tail and short tail lines of business and all of which are described below  to develop our ibnr loss reserves  a key objective of our actuaries is to identify aberrations and systemic changes occurring within historical experience and accurately adjust for them so that the future can be projected more reliably 
this process requires the substantial use of informed judgment and is inherently uncertain 
there are instances in which facts and circumstances require a deviation from the general process described above 
three such instances relate to the ibnr loss reserve processes for our hurricanes losses  our hurricanes losses and our asbestos exposures  where extrapolation techniques are not applied  except in a limited way  given the unique nature of hurricane losses and limited population of marine excess policies with potential asbestos exposures 
in such circumstances  inventories of the policy limits exposed to losses coupled with reported losses are analyzed and evaluated principally by claims personnel and underwriters to establish ibnr loss reserves 
a brief summary of each actuarial method discussed above follows loss ratio method this method is based on the assumption that ultimate losses vary proportionately with premiums 
pursuant to the loss ratio method  ibnr loss reserves are calculated by multiplying the earned premium by an expected ultimate loss ratio to estimate the ultimate losses for each underwriting year  then subtracting the reported losses  consisting of paid losses and case loss reserves  to determine the ibnr loss reserve amount 
the ultimate loss ratios applied are the company s best estimates for each underwriting year and are generally determined after evaluating a number of factors which include information derived by underwriters and actuaries in the initial pricing of the business  the ultimate loss ratios established in the prior accounting period and the related judgments applied  the ultimate loss ratios of previous underwriting years  premium rate changes  underwriting and coverage changes  changes in terms and conditions  legislative changes  exposure trends  loss development trends  claim frequency and severity trends  paid claims activity  remaining open case reserves and industry data where deemed appropriate 
such factors are also evaluated when selecting ultimate loss ratios and or loss development factors in the methods described below 
bornheutter ferguson method the bornheutter ferguson method calculates the ibnr loss reserves as the product of the earned premium  an expected ultimate loss ratio  and a loss development factor that represents the expected percentage of the ultimate losses that have been incurred but not yet reported 
the loss development factor equals one hundred percent less the expected percentage of losses that have thus far been reported  which is generally calculated as an average of the percentage of losses reported for comparable reporting periods of prior underwriting years 
the expected ultimate loss ratio is generally determined in the same manner as in the loss ratio method 
loss development method the loss development method  also known as the chainladder or the link ratio method  develops the ibnr loss reserves by multiplying the paid or reported losses by a loss development factor to estimate the ultimate losses  then subtracting the reported losses  consisting of paid losses and case loss reserves  to determine the ibnr loss reserves 
the loss development factor is the reciprocal of the expected percentage of losses that have thus far been reported  which is generally calculated as an average of the percentage of losses reported for comparable reporting periods of prior underwriting years 

table of contents frequency severity method the frequency severity method calculates the ibnr loss reserves by separately projecting claim count and average cost per claim data on either a paid or incurred basis 
it estimates the expected ultimate losses as the product of the ultimate number of claims that are expected to be reported and the expected average amount of these claims 
an annual loss reserve study is conducted by the company s actuaries for each major line of business employing the methodologies as described above with the timing of such studies varying throughout the year 
additionally  a review of the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations for each line of business  generally derived from the annual reserve study  is conducted each quarter to determine whether the assumptions used in the reserving process continue to form a reasonable basis for the projection of liabilities for each product line 
such reviews may result in maintaining or revising assumptions regarding future loss development based on various quantitative and qualitative considerations 
if actual loss activity differs from expectations  an upward or downward adjustment to loss reserves may occur 
as time passes  estimated loss reserves for an underwriting year will be based more on historical loss activity and loss development patterns rather than on assumptions based on underwriters input  pricing assumptions or industry experience 
the following discusses the method used for calculating the ibnr for each line of business and key assumptions used in applying the actuarial methods described 
marine generally  two key assumptions are used by our actuaries in setting ibnr loss reserves for major products in this line of business 
the first assumption is that our historical experience regarding paid and reported losses for each product where we have sufficient history can be relied on to predict future loss activity 
the second assumption is that our underwriters assessments as to potential loss exposures are reliable indicators of the level of our expected loss activity 
the specific loss reserves for marine are then analyzed separately by product based on such assumptions  except where noted below  with the major products including marine liability  cargo  p i  transport and bluewater hull 
the claims emergence patterns for various marine product lines vary substantially 
our largest marine product line is marine liability  which has one of the longer loss development patterns 
marine liability protects an insured s business from liability to third parties stemming from their marine related operations  such as terminal operations  stevedoring and marina operations 
since marine liability claims generally involve a dispute as to the extent and amount of legal liability that our insured has to a third party  these claims tend to take a longer time to develop and settle 
other longer tail marine product lines include p i insurance  which provides coverage for third party liability as well as injury to crew for vessel operators  and transport insurance  which provides both property and third party liability on a primary basis to businesses such as port authorities  marine terminal operators and others engaged in the infrastructure of international transportation 
other marine product lines have considerably shorter periods in which losses develop and settle 
ocean cargo insurance  for example  provides physical damage coverage to goods in the course of transit by water  air or land 
by their nature  cargo claims tend to be reported quickly as losses typically result from an obvious peril such as fire  theft or weather 
similarly  bluewater hull insurance provides coverage against physical damage to ocean going vessels 
such claims for physical damage generally are discovered  reported and settled quickly 
the company currently has extensive experience for all of these products and thus the ibnr loss reserves for all of the marine products are determined using the key assumptions and actuarial methodologies described above 
prior to  however  as discussed below  the company did not have sufficient experience in the transport product line and instead used its hull and liability products loss development experience as a key assumption in setting the ibnr loss reserves for its transport product 

table of contents property casualty the reserves for property and casualty are established separately by product with the major product being contractors liability insurance 
other products include offshore energy  commercial middle markets  primary casualty and excess casualty 
our actuaries generally utilize two key assumptions in this line of business first  that our historical loss development patterns are reasonable predictors of future loss patterns and second  that our claims personnel s assessment of our claims exposures and our underwriters assessment of our expected losses are reliable indicators of our loss exposure 
however  this line of business includes a number of newer products where there is insufficient company historical experience to project loss reserves and or loss development is sparse or erratic  which makes extrapolation techniques for those products extremely difficult to apply  and in those circumstances we typically rely more on industry data and our underwriters input in setting assumptions for our ibnr loss reserves as opposed to historical loss development patterns 
in addition  as discussed in more detail below with respect to construction defect reserves  our actuaries may take other market trends or events into account in setting ibnr loss reserves 
the substantial majority of the property and casualty loss reserves are for the contractors liability business  which insures mostly general and artisan contractors 
contractor liability claims are categorized into two claim types construction defect and other general liability 
other general liability claims typically derive from workplace accidents or from negligence alleged by third parties  and take a long time to report and settle 
construction defect claims involve the discovery of damage to buildings that was caused by latent construction defects 
these claims take a very long time to report and to settle compared to other general liability claims 
since construction defect claims report much later than other contractor liability claims  they are analyzed separately in the annual loss reserve study 
we have extensive history in the contractors liability business upon which to perform actuarial analyses and we use the key assumption noted above relating to our own historical experience as a reliable indicator of the future for this product 
however  there is inherent uncertainty in the loss reserve estimation process for this line of business given both the long tail nature of the liability claims and the continuing underwriting and coverage changes  claims handling and reserve changes  and legislative changes that have occurred over a several year period 
such factors are judgmentally taken into account in this line of business in specific periods 
the underwriting and coverage changes include the migration to a non admitted business from admitted business in  which allowed us to exclude certain exposures previously permitted for example  exposure to construction work performed prior to the policy inception  withdrawals from certain contractor classes previously underwritten and expansion into new states beginning in claims changes include bringing the claim handling in house in and changes in case reserving practices in and a california legislative change with respect to reserves and claim frequency for construction defect repairs  became effective july  with a sunset provision effective january  the law provides for an alternative dispute resolution system that attempts to involve all parties to a claim at an early stage 
the legislation may impact claim severity  frequency and the length of settlement which may ultimately be different than historical loss development assumptions employed in our loss reserve process 
most recently  in setting the ibnr loss reserves for construction defect claims  our actuaries have begun to consider a new qualitative factor based on their evolving concern with the recent decline in home values caused by the subprime home mortgage crisis and its possible impact on the frequency and severity of construction defect claims 
as a result  our actuaries acknowledge this uncertainty and anticipate claims arising from alleged construction defects contributing to housing value declines on policies written on newly constructed homes in our portfolio 
we believe our reserves remain adequate to address such potential exposure  but we can give no assurances with respect thereto 
offshore energy provides physical damage coverage to offshore oil platforms along with offshore operations related to oil exploration and production 
the significant offshore energy claims are generally caused by fire or storms  and thus tend to be large  infrequent  quickly reported  but occasionally not quickly settled because the damage is often extensive but not always immediately known 
the commercial middle markets or nav pac business consists of general liability  auto liability and property exposures for a variety of commercial middle market businesses  principally hospitality  manufacturing and garages 
commencing in  our actuaries are segmenting and analyzing the components of the loss development for this business among the property  liability and auto exposures which had been previously combined 

table of contents primary casualty insurance provides primary general liability coverage principally to corporations in the construction and manufacturing sector 
excess casualty insurance is purchased by corporations which seek higher limits of liability than are provided in their primary casualty policies 
neither product line has a significant amount of loss activity reported to date 
because we have limited historical experience in these products  the ibnr loss reserves for both of these products currently are established using the loss ratio method primarily based on our underwriters input and industry loss experience 
loss reserves include our european property business written by the uk branch which was discontinued in we have limited loss history and rely primarily on assumptions based on underwriters input and industry experience 
in addition  loss reserves for aviation  property and assumed reinsurance business  in run off since  are periodically monitored and evaluated by claims and actuarial personnel 
professional liability the professional liability policies mainly provide coverage on a claims made basis mostly for a one year period 
the reserves for professional liability are analyzed separately by product with the major products being directors and officers d o liability coverage and errors and omissions e o liability coverage for lawyers and other professionals 
the losses for d o business are generally very large and infrequent  and typically involve securities class actions 
d o claims report reasonably quickly  but may take several years to settle 
while we have been writing d o business since  the limited claim history is generally insufficient to establish ibnr loss reserves using company data 
as a result  we principally employ assumptions based on industry experience coupled with input from its underwriters and its claims staff s assessment of potential exposure to establish ibnr loss reserves 
another key assumption with respect to establishing ibnr loss reserves for d o business is that such industry experience is representative of our future potential loss development with respect to trends in class action activity  such as the impact of stock option backdating  laddering and  most recently  the subprime mortgage crisis 
as time passes  for a given underwriting year  additional weight is given to assumptions relating to our actual experience and claims outstanding 
the e o ibnr loss reserve process is similar to the process for d o  with the exception of a particular book of business of the uk branch written from through for the uk branch e o business  we assume the claims  while similar in nature to the claims in the us e o business  are larger  more frequent and have a longer loss development pattern 
the ibnr loss reserves for the uk branch e o business are determined judgmentally after reviewing recent loss activity relative to the remaining in force policy count and the loss activity for similar insureds 
lloyd s operations reserves for the company s lloyd s operations are reviewed separately for the marine and professional liability lines by product 
the major marine products are marine liability  offshore energy  cargo  specie and marine reinsurance  and the major products for professional liability are international d o and international e o 
the marine liability  offshore energy and cargo products and related loss exposures are similar in nature to that described for marine business above 
specie insurance provides property coverage for chattel  such as jewelry  fine art and cash in transit 
claims tend to be from theft or damage  quick to report and quick to settle 
marine reinsurance is a diversified global book of reinsurance  the majority of which consists of excess of loss reinsurance policies for which claims activity tends to be large and infrequent with loss development somewhat longer than for such products written on a direct basis 
marine reinsurance reinsures liability  cargo  hull and offshore energy exposures that are similar in nature to the marine business described above 
the process for establishing the ibnr loss reserves for the marine and professional liability lines of the lloyd s operations  and the assumptions used as part of this process  are similar in nature to the process employed by the insurance companies 
other business for the lloyd s operations include european property and inland marine products  each of which is a new line of business where we have limited loss history and rely primarily on assumptions based on our underwriters input and industry loss experience 

table of contents the lloyd s operations products also include property coverages for engineering and construction projects and onshore energy business  which are substantially reinsured 
losses from engineering and construction projects tend to result from loss of use due to construction delays while losses from onshore energy business are usually caused by fires or explosions 
large losses tend to be catastrophic in nature and are heavily reinsured 
ibnr loss reserves for attritional losses are established based on the syndicate s extensive loss experience 
sensitivity analysis we do not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates 
we believe that ranges may not be a true reflection of the potential volatility between carried loss reserves and the ultimate settlement amount of losses incurred prior to the balance sheet date 
the actual losses may not emerge as expected  which would cause the ranges to expand or contract from year to year 
the impact of these shifts in the ranges will be greater in lines with longer emergence patterns 
the individual lines will also have greater variance than the range for the entire book of business 
the boundaries of the reasonably likely ranges do not have a symmetrical relationship with our carried reserves and intentionally reflect a wider variation in the increases than for the decreases and  correspondingly  a wider deviation in the deficiency than in the redundancy 
set forth below is a sensitivity analysis that estimates the effect on our net loss reserve position of using alternative expected loss ratios for the underwriting years to and alternative loss development factors for underwriting years to rather than those loss ratios and factors actually used in determining our best estimates at december  the analysis addresses each major line of business and underwriting year for which a material deviation to our overall reserve position is believed reasonably possible  and uses what we believe is a reasonably likely range of potential deviation for each line of business 
there can be no assurance  however  that actual reserve development will be materially consistent with either the original or the adjusted expected loss ratios or loss development factor assumptions  or with other assumptions made in the reserving process 
for the selected alternative expected loss ratios  our actuaries observed the range of ultimate loss ratios recorded for the underwriting years to for each major line of business at december  
table of contents the reasonably likely ranges of potential deviation in the loss ratios for each line of business for the to underwriting years expressed in loss ratio points are as follows reasonably likely loss ratio point variances decrease increase insurance companies marine property casualty professional liability lloyd s operations for the loss development factor variance  our actuaries employed a standard technique which is based on the historical development factors observed for each line of business from the paid and incurred loss development triangles with the latest evaluation at december  the historical factors are used to generate alternative outcomes which could arise in the ultimate development due to the random variability inherent in future development 
the alternative outcomes are generated by a stochastic simulation 
the ranges may contract or expand if future development deviates from historical experience 
the reasonably likely ranges of potential deviations in the aggregate or overall loss development factors applicable to the total of all underwriting years for each line of business are as follows reasonably likely ultimate loss development factor variances decrease increase insurance companies marine property casualty professional liability lloyd s operations such sensitivity analysis was performed in the aggregate for all products in each line of business 
the use of aggregate data was considered more stable and reliable compared to a product by product analysis 
we cannot assure  however  that such use of aggregate data will provide a more accurate range of the actual variations in loss development 
the sensitivity analysis uses loss ratios for the to underwriting years  which are believed to be more representative compared to years prior to given our evolving mix of business  product changes and other factors 
there can be no assurances  however  that the use of such recent history is more predictive of actual development as compared to employing longer periods of history 
in addition  while the net loss reserves include the net loss reserves for asbestos exposures  such amounts were excluded from the sensitivity analysis given the nature of how such reserves are established by the company 
while we believe such net reserves are adequate  we cannot assure that material loss development may not arise in the future from asbestos losses given the complex nature of such exposures 

table of contents the total company range amounts below were determined by aggregating the reasonably likely range amounts for each line of business assuming that the variances in the lines of business are uncorrelated to each other 
such amounts may not be representative of the actual aggregate favorable or unfavorable loss development amounts that may occur over time 
total reasonably likely range of deviation net loss redundancy deficiency reserve amount amount in thousands insurance companies marine property casualty professional liability total insurance companies total lloyd s operations total company increase decrease to net income amount per share used million average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december  reinsurance recoverables 
reinsurance recoverables are established for the portion of the loss reserves that are ceded to reinsurers 
reinsurance recoverables are determined based upon the terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts which could be subject to interpretations that differ from our own based on judicial theories of liability 
in addition  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers which can be significant considering that certain of the reserves remain outstanding for an extended period of time 
we are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
additional information regarding our reinsurance recoverables can be found in the business reinsurance recoverables section and note  reinsurance  to our consolidated financial statements  both included herein 
written and unearned premium 
written premium is recorded based on the insurance policies that have been reported to us and the policies that have been written by agents but not yet reported to us 
we must estimate the amount of written premium not yet reported based on judgments relative to current and historical trends of the business being written 
such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current year s results 
an unearned premium reserve is established to reflect the unexpired portion of each policy at the financial reporting date 
reinsurance reinstatement premium is earned in the period in which the event occurred which created the need to record the reinstatement premium 
additional information regarding our written and unearned premium can be found in note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  and note  reinsurance  to our consolidated financial statements  both included herein 
substantially all of our business is placed through agents and brokers 
since the vast majority of our gross written premiums are primary or direct  as opposed to assumed  the delays in reporting assumed premiums generally do not have a significant effect on our financial statements  since we record estimates for both unreported direct and assumed premium 
we also record the ceded portion of the estimated gross written premium and related acquisition costs 
the earned gross  ceded and net premiums are calculated based on our earning methodology which is generally pro rata over the policy period 
losses are also recorded in relation to the earned premium 
the estimate for losses incurred on the estimated premium is based on an actuarial calculation consistent with the methodology used to determine incurred but not reported loss reserves for reported premiums 

table of contents a portion of our premium is estimated for unreported premium  mostly for the marine business written by our uk branch and lloyd s operations 
we generally do not experience any significant backlog in processing premiums 
such premium estimates are generally based on submission data received from brokers and agents and recorded when the insurance policy or reinsurance contract is written or bound 
the estimates are regularly reviewed and updated taking into account the premium received to date versus the estimate and the age of the estimate 
to the extent that the actual premium varies from the estimates  the difference  along with the related loss reserves and underwriting expenses  is recorded in current operations 
deferred tax assets 
we apply the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
additional information regarding our deferred tax assets can be found in note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  and note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements  both included herein 
impairment of invested assets 
management regularly reviews our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of investments 
in the first quarter of  we adopted accounting guidance relating to the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments otti on fixed maturity securities 
when assessing whether the amortized cost basis of a fixed maturity security will be recovered  we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected to the current book value 
any shortfalls of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected in relation to the amortized cost basis is considered the credit loss portion of otti losses and is recognized in earnings 
all non credit losses are recognized as changes in otti losses within other comprehensive income oci 
prior to  when a fixed maturity security in our investment portfolio had an unrealized loss that was deemed to be other than temporary  we wrote the security down to fair value through a charge to operations 
for equity securities  in general  we focus our attention on those securities whose fair value was less than of their cost for six or more consecutive months 
if warranted as the result of conditions relating to a particular security  we will focus on a significant decline in fair value regardless of the time period involved 
factors considered in evaluating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  the current fair value as compared to cost of the security  the length of time the investment has been below cost and by how much 
if an equity security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  the cost is written down to fair value with the loss recognized in earnings 
for equity securities  we consider our intent to hold securities as part of the process of evaluating whether a decline in fair value represents an other than temporary decline in value 
for fixed maturity securities  we consider our intent to sell a security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security before the anticipated recovery as part of the process of evaluating whether a security s unrealized loss represents an other than temporary decline 
our ability to hold such securities is supported by sufficient cash flow from its operations and from maturities within its investment portfolio in order to meet its claims payments and other disbursement obligations arising from its underwriting operations without selling such investments 
with respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the security s value is not written down  a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss 
subsequent decisions on security sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring  changing information and market conditions 

table of contents day to day management of our investment portfolio is outsourced to third party investment managers 
while these investment managers may  at a given point in time  believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered  the dynamic nature of the portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss based upon a change in market and other factors described above 
we believe that subsequent decisions to sell such securities are consistent with the classification of our portfolio as available for sale 
investment managers are required to notify management of rating agency downgrades of securities in their portfolios as well as any potential investment valuation issues at the end of each quarter 
investment managers are also required to notify management  and receive approval  prior to the execution of a transaction or series of related transactions that may result in a realized loss above a certain threshold 
additionally  investment managers are required to notify management  and receive approval  prior to the execution of a transaction or series of related transactions that may result in any realized loss up until a certain period beyond the close of a quarterly accounting period 
accounting for lloyd s results

prior year reserve redundancies deficiencies as part of our regular review of prior reserves  our actuaries may determine  based on their judgment  that certain assumptions made in the reserving process in prior years may need to be revised to reflect various factors  likely including the availability of additional information 
based on their reserve analyses  our actuaries may make corresponding reserve adjustments 
prior year reserve redundancies of million  million and million net of reinsurance were recorded in  and  respectively  as discussed below 
the relevant factors that may have a significant impact on the establishment and adjustment of loss and lae reserves can vary by line of business and from period to period 
to the extent that reserves are deficient or redundant  the amount of such deficiency or redundancy is recorded as a charge or credit to earnings in the period in which the deficiency or redundancy is identified based on the information that is available at that time 
the segment and line of business breakdowns of prior period net reserve deficiencies redundancies were as follows year ended december  in thousands insurance companies marine property casualty professional liability insurance companies lloyd s operations total following is a discussion of relevant factors impacting our loss reserves the insurance companies recorded million of net prior year unfavorable development for the marine business  of which million arose in the marine liability business due to large loss activity in excess of our prior expectations mostly across underwriting years to that we recognized by reserve strengthening 

table of contents the insurance companies recorded million of net prior year savings for property casualty business in total 
the favorable development included million for contractors liability due to an actuarial review conducted in which indicated that loss development on the and prior underwriting years has been more favorable than our prior expectations for those underwriting years million from our primary e s lines and million in excess casualty business due to favorable loss trends in underwriting years and prior  and million of favorable development on our offshore energy navtech book due to favorable claims trends across a number of prior underwriting years 
partially offsetting these favorable developments were adverse development of million in our nav pac business due to reported loss activity in excess of our prior expectations from most underwriting years resulting from reviews of open claims in the auto and liability lines of business million from our liquor business  which is now in run off  and million in our personal umbrella books of business across most underwriting years where large loss activity has exceeded our expectations 
the insurance companies recorded million of net prior year unfavorable development for professional liability 
the directors and officers liability book of business had million of adverse development  which was primarily attributable to the unexpected development of previously reported claims in the and prior underwriting years 
this loss activity was inconsistent with the loss emergence trends that we observed in calendar years and and it caused us to increase our ultimate loss projections in the and prior underwriting years  as well as those in the more current underwriting years 
the lawyers liability book of business had adverse development of million due to reported loss activity in underwriting years to in excess of our prior expectations 
the lloyd s operations recorded million of net favorable development which included million on marine business concentrated in the liability specie and cargo books due to reported losses being less than our expectations in underwriting years to and million on offshore energy business due to favorable loss trends in several years  partially offset by million of adverse loss development in the professional liability books due to reported loss activity in excess of our expectations in the lawyers liability book of business for losses occurring in and million in the property book due to an extension in the loss development pattern for the and underwriting years 
following is a discussion of relevant factors impacting our loss reserves the insurance companies recorded million of net prior year savings for marine business  primarily comprised of million of savings in the marine liability business  million of savings in the protection and indemnity business  million of savings in the transport business and million of savings due to a review of reinsurance recoverable in the second quarter of  partially offset by million of strengthening in the cargo business  million of strengthening in the craft and hull businesses  and million recorded for a commutation with a reinsurer 
the favorable development for marine liability  protection and indemnity  and transport was primarily due to reduced claims activity for underwriting years through as well as ibnr loss reserve reductions that resulted from the reduced claims activity 
the adverse development for cargo  craft and hull was primarily due to several large claims in underwriting years and 
table of contents the insurance companies recorded million of net prior year savings for property casualty business 
this included million savings in the contractors liability business  million of savings in the offshore energy business  million of net prior year savings in the property and aviation run off business million of savings in the commercial umbrella business  million of savings in the personal umbrella business  and million of savings in the primary e s business  partially offset by million of net adverse development in the middle markets business as a result of an actuarial analysis that indicated that strengthening is required for the automobile coverage due to frequency and severity in excess of our expectations and million of strengthening due to greater than expected loss activity in a discontinued liquor liability program and million of strengthening in the program business 
the favorable development for contractors liability  commercial umbrella  personal umbrella and primary e s were primarily due to reduced claims activity in underwriting years through the favorable development for the aviation business was as a result of an actuarial analysis that indicated that the losses are substantially reported and the ibnr loss reserves could be reduced 
the adverse development for the liquor liability business was due to a discontinued program and the adverse development on the programs business was due to an active program 
the insurance companies recorded million of net prior year savings for professional liability 
this was primarily due to the reduction in case and ibnr reserves for the directors and officers business in underwriting years through resulting from reported losses being less than anticipated during the lloyd s operations recorded million of net prior year savings  primarily in the marine liability  energy  specie and reinsurance business for underwriting years and prior 
the favorable development is the result of more extensive analysis of the potential future development which led us to shorten the development patterns 
following is a discussion of relevant factors impacting our loss reserves the insurance companies recorded million of net prior years savings in the marine business primarily comprised of million of savings in the transport business  million of savings in the marine liability business  million of savings in the cargo business  million of savings in each of the hull  partially offset by million for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables for asbestos losses 
the favorable development for the liability  cargo and hull coverages was primarily due to reduced claim activity for the and underwriting years 
prior to  because the company did not have sufficient experience in the transport product line  it instead used its hull and liability products loss development experience as a key assumption in setting the ibnr loss reserves for its transport product 
commencing in  our actuaries determined that the company s loss development experience for its transport product had become sufficiently credible to begin establishing transport reserves using such experience  which resulted in the prior year savings referred to above recorded for this business 

table of contents the insurance companies recorded million of net prior years savings almost entirely for its property casualty business related to the contractors liability business for the years through the prior years savings recorded for contractors liability business was due mostly to continued favorable loss frequency and severity trends for to compared to expectations 
our actuaries believe that the favorable loss frequency trends result primarily from a number of underwriting and coverage changes since  including the migration to non admitted business from admitted business in  which allowed the company to exclude certain previously permitted exposures for example  exposure to construction work performed prior to the policy inception  and withdrawals from certain contractor classes previously underwritten 
our actuaries believe that the favorable loss severity trends result primarily from improved claim practices coupled with a california legislative change  effective in mid  which provides for an alternative dispute resolution system with respect to construction defect claims and is intended to avoid or mitigate costly litigation and claims settlements 
while our actuaries were unable to precisely quantify the impact of each of the foregoing factors  such factors were judgmentally taken into account in recording such prior years savings for contractors liability business by evaluating actual loss development compared to expected loss development coupled with a frequency and severity claims analysis conducted in the insurance companies have historically reserved for the professional liability business using ultimate loss ratios based on industry experience for this line of business given the company s limited claims history 
such industry experience is heavily influenced by the historical frequency and severity of large securities class action lawsuits 
during  the insurance companies reduced the net reserves for such claims made policies compared to year end by million  mostly related to policies issued in and the reductions were made to recognize both the low level of open claim counts and the lack of observed claim severity compared to expectations at the time the reserves were initially established using industry experience 
the lloyd s operations recorded million of net prior year savings  comprised of million due to a review of the hurricanes katrina and rita loss estimates  a release of approximately million following a review of open claim files for the years to  a million reduction in our underwriting year estimates for the marine liability book due to favorable loss trends  and the remaining million was mostly for offshore energy and marine liability business on business underwritten during hurricanes gustav and ike during  we recorded gross and net loss estimates of million and million  respectively  exclusive of million for the cost of excess of loss reinstatement premiums  related to the third quarter hurricanes gustav and ike 
our pre tax net loss as a result of hurricanes gustav and ike was approximately million  which increased our combined ratio by ratio points

in general  our participation on such risks is in the excess layers  which requires the underlying coverage to be exhausted prior to coverage being triggered in our layer 
in many instances we are one of many insurers who participate in the defense and ultimate settlement of these claims  and we are generally a minor participant in the overall insurance coverage and settlement 
the reserves for asbestos exposures at december  are for i one large settled claim for excess insurance policy limits exposed to a class action suit against an insured involved in the manufacturing or distribution of asbestos products being paid over several years two other large settled claims were fully paid in  ii other insureds not directly involved in the manufacturing or distribution of asbestos products  but that have more than incidental asbestos exposure for their purchase or use of products that contained asbestos  and iii attritional asbestos claims that could be expected to occur over time 
substantially all of our asbestos liability reserves are included in our marine loss reserves 
we believe that there are no remaining known claims where we would suffer a material loss as a result of excess policy limits being exposed to class action suits for insureds involved in the manufacturing or distribution of asbestos products 
there can be no assurances  however  that material loss development may not arise in the future from existing asbestos claims or new claims given the evolving and complex legal environment that may directly impact the outcome of the asbestos exposures of our insureds

during  we increased our provision for uncollectible reinsurance for asbestos losses by million which was recorded in incurred losses 
in addition  in  we settled demands for arbitration with two asbestos reinsurers 
we believe that we will be able to collect reinsurance on the gross portion of its historic gross asbestos exposure in the above table 
to the extent we incur additional gross loss development for our historic asbestos exposure  we do not expect to realize additional reinsurance recoverables

table of contents at december   the ibnr loss reserve was million or of our total loss reserves compared to million or in the increase in net loss reserves in all active lines of business is generally a reflection of the growth in net premium volume over the last three years coupled with a changing mix of business to longer tail lines of business such as the specialty lines of business construction defect  commercial excess  primary excess  professional liability lines of business and marine liability and transport business in ocean marine 
these products  which typically have a longer settlement period compared to the mix of business we have historically written  are becoming larger components of our overall business 
commission expense 
commission expenses paid to unaffiliated brokers and agents are generally based on a percentage of the gross written premiums and are reduced by ceding commissions we may receive on the ceded written premiums 
commissions are generally deferred and recorded as deferred policy acquisition costs to the extent that they relate to unearned premium 
the percentages of commission expenses to net earned premium was in  in and in the commission expense ratio excluding the effects of the hurricanes was 
other operating expense 
the and increases in other operating expenses when comparing to and comparing to  respectively  were attributable primarily to employee related expenses resulting from expansion of the business 
interest expense 
the interest expense reflects interest on our senior notes issued in april income taxes the income tax expense was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was less than due to permanent differences between book and tax return income  with the most significant item being tax exempt interest 
as of december  and  the net deferred federal  foreign  state and local tax assets were million and million  respectively 
we are subject to the tax regulations of the united states and foreign countries in which we operate 
we file a consolidated federal tax return  which includes all domestic subsidiaries and the uk branch 
the income from the foreign operations is designated as either us connected income or non us connected income 
lloyd s is required to pay us income tax on us connected income written by lloyd s syndicates 
lloyd s and the irs have entered into an agreement whereby the amount of tax due on us connected income is calculated by lloyd s and remitted directly to the irs 
these amounts are then charged to the corporate members in proportion to their participation in the relevant syndicates 
our corporate members are subject to this agreement and will receive uk tax credits for any uk income tax incurred up to the uk income tax charged on the uk income 
the uk connected insurance income would generally constitute taxable income under the subpart f income section of the internal revenue code since less than of our premium is derived within the uk and would therefore be subject to us taxation when the lloyd s year of account closes 
taxes are accrued at a rate on our foreign source insurance income and foreign tax credits  where available  are utilized to offset us tax as permitted 
our effective tax rate for syndicate taxable income could substantially exceed to the extent we are unable to offset us taxes paid under subpart f tax regulations with us tax credits on future underwriting year distributions 
us taxes are not accrued on the earnings of our foreign agencies as these earnings are not subject to the subpart f tax regulations 
these earnings are subject to taxes under uk tax regulations 
a finance bill was enacted in the uk on july  that reduces the uk corporate tax rate from to effective april  the effect of such tax rate change was not material to our financial statements 
we have not provided for us deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of approximately million of our non us subsidiaries since these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in the foreign subsidiary 
however  in the future  if such earnings were distributed to the company  taxes of approximately million would be payable on such undistributed earnings and would be reflected in the tax provision for the year in which these earnings are no longer intended to be permanently reinvested in the non us subsidiary assuming all foreign tax credits are realized 

table of contents we had net state and local deferred tax assets amounting to potential future tax benefits of million and million at december  and  respectively

a valuation allowance was established for the full amount of these potential future tax benefits due to the uncertainty associated with their realization 
our state and local tax carryforwards at december  expire from to segment information we classify our business into two underwriting segments consisting of the insurance companies and the lloyd s operations  which are separately managed  and a corporate segment 
segment data for each of the two underwriting segments include allocations of revenues and expenses of the wholly owned underwriting management companies and the parent company s operating expenses and related income tax amounts 
the corporate segment consists of the parent company s investment income  interest expense and the related tax effect 
we evaluate the performance of each segment based on its underwriting and gaap results 
the insurance companies and the lloyd s operations results are measured by taking into account net earned premiums  net losses and loss adjustment expenses  commission expenses  other operating expenses  commission income and other income expense 
each segment also maintains its own investments  on which it earns income and realizes capital gains or losses 
our underwriting performance is evaluated separately from the performance of our investment portfolios

table of contents we analyze the unrealized losses quarterly to determine if any are other than temporary 
the above unrealized losses have been determined to be temporary based on our policies 
see critical accounting estimates impairment of invested assets for additional information on our policies 
the residential mortgage obligation s gross unrealized loss in the above table for the greater than months category consists primarily of residential mortgage backed securities 
residential mortgage backed securities are a type of fixed income security in which residential mortgage loans are sold into a trust or special purpose vehicle  thereby securitizing the cash flows of the mortgage loans 
to determine whether the unrealized loss on structured securities is other than temporary  we project an expected principal loss under a range of scenarios and utilize the most likely outcomes 
the analysis relies on actual collateral performance measures such as default rate  prepayment rate and loss severity 
these assumptions are applied throughout the remaining term of the deal  incorporating the transaction structure and priority of payments  to generate loss adjusted cash flows 
results of the analysis will indicate whether the security ultimately incurs a loss or whether there is a material impact on yield due to either a projected loss or a change in cash flow timing 
a breakeven default rate is also calculated 
a comparison to the break even default rate to the actual default rate provides an indication of the level of cushion or coverage to the first dollar principal loss 
the analysis applies these assumptions throughout the remaining term of the transaction to forecast cash flows  which are then applied through the transaction structure to determine whether there is a loss to the security 
for securities in which a tranche loss is present  and the net present value of loss adjusted cash flows is less than book value  an impairment is recognized 
the output data also includes a number of additional metrics such as average life remaining  original and current credit support  over day delinquency and security rating 
as of december   the largest single unrealized loss by an issuer in the fixed maturities category was million 
the following table summarizes the gross unrealized investment losses as of december  by length of time where the fair value is less than of amortized cost 
period for which fair value is less than of amortized cost months longer than or longer  less less than months  less than months months than months months or longer total in thousands fixed maturities equity securities total the fair value of our investment portfolio may fluctuate significantly in response to various factors such as changes in interest rates  investment quality ratings  equity prices  foreign exchange rates and credit spreads 
we do not have the intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that we will have to sell debt securities in unrealized loss positions that are not other than temporarily impaired before recovery 
we may realize investment losses to the extent our liquidity needs require the disposition of fixed maturity securities in unfavorable interest rate  liquidity or credit spread environments 
significant changes in the factors we consider when evaluating impairment losses could result in a significant change in impairment losses reported in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the following table shows the composition by naic rating and the generally equivalent s p and moody s ratings of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio with gross unrealized losses at december  not all of the securities are rated by s p and or moody s gross equivalent equivalent unrealized loss fair value naic s p moody s percent percent rating rating rating amount of total amount of total in thousands aaa aa a aaa aa a   bbb baa   bb ba  b b   ccc or lower caa or lower   n a n a  total at december   the gross unrealized losses in the table directly above are related to fixed maturity securities that are rated investment grade  which is defined by us as a security having an naic rating of or  an s p rating of bbb or higher  or a moody s rating of baa or higher

due to the periodic repayment of principal  the mortgage backed and asset backed securities are estimated to have an effective maturity of approximately years 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations were million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the decline in cash flow from operations in compared to was primarily a result of an increase in losses and lae paid for claims of million 
operating cash flow was used primarily to acquire additional investments of fixed income securities

we believe that we have limited exposure to credit risk since the fixed maturity investment portfolio  except for million  consists of investment grade bonds 
at december   our investment portfolio had an average maturity of years and a duration of years 
management periodically projects cash flow of the investment portfolio and other sources in order to maintain the appropriate levels of liquidity to ensure our ability to satisfy claims 
as of december  and  all fixed maturity securities and equity securities held by us were classified as available for sale 

table of contents on april   we entered into a million credit facility agreement entitled fourth amended and restated credit agreement with a consortium of banks  and is a letter of credit facility that replaced the credit facility that expired on march  the credit facility expires on april  the credit facility is utilized primarily by navigators corporate underwriters ltd 
and millennium underwriting ltd 
to fund our participation in syndicate through letters of credit 
the letters of credit issued under the facility are denominated in british pounds and their aggregate face amount will fluctuate based on exchange rates 
the credit facility had previously been amended in february to increase the letters of credit available under the credit facility from million to million and to increase the line of credit available under the credit facility from million to million 
in addition  the expiration of the credit facility was extended from june  to march  the credit facility contains customary covenants for facilities of this type  including restrictions on indebtedness and liens  limitations on mergers  dividends and the sale of assets  and requirements as to maintaining certain consolidated tangible net worth  statutory surplus and other financial ratios 
the credit facility also provides for customary events of default  including failure to pay principal  interest or fees when due  failure to comply with covenants  any representation or warranty made by the company being false in any material respect  default under certain other indebtedness  certain insolvency or receivership events affecting the company and its subsidiaries  the occurrence of certain material judgments  or a change in control of the company 
the letter of credit facility is collateralized by all of the common stock of navigators insurance company and to the extent the aggregate face amount issued under the credit facility exceeds million on account of these fluctuations we are required to post collateral with the lead bank of the consortium  which we have done as of december  in the amount of million 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  at december   letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of million were issued under the credit facility 
as a result of the april  amendment  the cost of the letter of credit portion of the credit facility increased to from for the issued letters of credit and to from for the unutilized portion of the letter of credit facility 
as a result of the amendment  the cost of the letter of credit portion of the credit facility was reduced to from for the issued letters of credit and to from for the unutilized portion of the letter of credit facility 
the cost of the line of credit portion of the credit facility was also reduced to from over our choice of libor or prime for the utilized portion and to from for the unutilized portion 
our reinsurance has been placed with various us and foreign insurance companies and with selected syndicates at lloyd s 
pursuant to the implementation of lloyd s plan of reconstruction and renewal  a portion of our recoverables are now reinsured by equitas a separate united kingdom authorized reinsurance company established to reinsure outstanding liabilities of all lloyd s members for all risks written in the or prior years of account 
time lags do occur in the normal course of business between the time gross losses are paid by the company and the time such gross losses are billed and collected from reinsurers 
reinsurance recoverable amounts related to those gross loss reserves are anticipated to be billed and collected over the next several years as gross losses are paid by the company 
generally  for pro rata or quota share reinsurers  including pool participants  we issue quarterly settlement statements for premiums less commissions and paid loss activity  which are expected to be settled by the end of the subsequent quarter 
we have the ability to issue cash calls requiring such reinsurers to pay losses whenever paid loss activity for a claim ceded to a particular reinsurance treaty exceeds a predetermined amount generally million as set forth in the pro rata treaty 
for the insurance companies  cash calls must generally be paid within calendar days 
there is generally no specific settlement period for the lloyd s operations cash call provisions  but such billings are usually paid within calendar days 

table of contents generally  for excess of loss reinsurers we pay monthly or quarterly deposit premiums based on the estimated subject premiums over the contract period usually one year which are subsequently adjusted based on actual premiums determined after the expiration of the applicable reinsurance treaty 
paid losses subject to excess of loss recoveries are generally billed as they occur and are usually settled by reinsurers within calendar days for the insurance companies and business days for the lloyd s operations 
we sometimes withhold funds from reinsurers and may apply ceded loss billings against such funds in accordance with the applicable reinsurance agreements 
at december   ceded asbestos paid and unpaid losses recoverable were million 
we generally experience significant collection delays for a large portion of reinsurance recoverable amounts for asbestos losses given that certain reinsurers are in run off or otherwise no longer active in the reinsurance business 
such circumstances are considered in our ongoing assessment of such reinsurance recoverables 
we believe that we have adequately managed our cash flow requirements related to reinsurance recoveries from our positive cash flows and the use of available short term funds when applicable 
however  there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to adequately manage such recoveries in the future or that collection disputes or reinsurer insolvencies will not arise that could materially increase the collection time lags or result in recoverable write offs causing additional incurred losses and liquidity constraints to the company 
the payment of gross claims and related collections from reinsurers with respect to hurricanes gustav  ike  katrina and rita could significantly impact our liquidity needs 
however  we expect to continue to pay these hurricane losses over a period of years from cash flow and  if needed  short term investments 
we expect to collect our paid reinsurance recoverables generally under the terms described above 
we believe that the cash flow generated by the operating activities of our subsidiaries will provide sufficient funds for us to meet our liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
beyond the next twelve months  cash flow available to us may be influenced by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions and conditions in the insurance and reinsurance markets  as well as fluctuations from year to year in claims experience 
our capital resources consist of funds deployed or available to be deployed to support our business operations 
at december  and  our capital resources were as follows december  in thousands senior debt stockholders equity total capitalization ratio of debt to total capitalization 
table of contents the increase in stockholders equity in was primarily due to net income of million and million of unrealized gains in within our investment portfolio 
the increase in stockholders equity in was primarily due to net income of million partially offset by million of unrealized losses in within our investment portfolio 
we monitor our capital adequacy to support our business on a regular basis 
the future capital requirements of our business will depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
our ability to underwrite is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies 
in particular  we require sufficient capital to maintain our financial strength ratings  as issued by several ratings agencies  at a level considered necessary by management to enable our insurance companies to compete  sufficient capital to enable our insurance companies to meet the capital adequacy tests performed by statutory agencies in the united states and the united kingdom and letters of credit and other forms of collateral that are necessary to support the business plan of our lloyd s operations 
as part of our capital management program  we may seek to raise additional capital or may seek to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases  cash dividends or other methods or a combination of such methods 
any such determination will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our profits  financial requirements and other factors  including legal restrictions  rating agency requirements  credit facility limitations and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
in november  the company s board of directors adopted a stock repurchase program for up to million of our common stock through december  purchases under the program will be made from time to time at prevailing prices in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
the timing and amount of purchases under the program to date are dependent on a variety of factors  including the trading price of the stock  market conditions and corporate and regulatory considerations 
through december  we purchased  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million 
from january  through february   the parent company purchased an additional  shares of its common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of million 
in october  the company s board of directors adopted a stock repurchase program for up to million of our common stock 
purchases were made from time to time at prevailing prices in open market or privately negotiated transactions through the expiration of the program on december  the timing and amount of purchases under the program were dependent on a variety of factors  including the trading price of the stock  market conditions and corporate and regulatory considerations 
in total  we purchased  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million 
to the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to fund our future operating requirements or maintain such ratings  we may need to raise additional funds through financings or limit our growth 
if we are not able to obtain adequate capital  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected  which could include  among other things  the following possible outcomes potential downgrades in the financial strength ratings assigned by ratings agencies to our insurance companies which could place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to higher rated competitors  reductions in the amount of business that our insurance companies or lloyd s operations are able to write in order to meet capital adequacy based tests enforced by statutory agencies  and any resultant ratings downgrades could  among other things  affect our ability to write business and increase the cost of the credit facility 

table of contents in addition to common share capital  we may need to depend on external sources of finance to support our underwriting activities  which can be in the form or any combination of debt securities  preference shares  common equity and bank credit facilities providing loans and or letters of credit 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are unfavorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our shareholders could result  and  in any case  such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our outstanding securities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitive instruments and risk management market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
we are exposed to potential loss to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and how those exposures have been managed through december  our market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for purposes other than trading and speculation 
the carrying value of our investment portfolio as of december  was billion of which was invested in fixed maturity securities 
the primary market risk to our investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities 
we do not have any commodity risk exposure 
for fixed maturity securities  short term liquidity needs and the potential liquidity needs of the business are key factors in managing the portfolio 
the portfolio duration relative to the liabilities duration is primarily managed through investment transactions 
there were no significant changes regarding the investment portfolio in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed for the twelve months ended december  we do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
interest rate risk sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time 
in our sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure  especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by us to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
in this sensitivity analysis model  we use fair values to measure our potential loss 
the sensitivity analysis model includes fixed maturities and short term investments 
the primary market risk to our market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk 
the sensitivity analysis model uses a and basis points change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 
changes in interest rates will have an immediate effect on comprehensive income and shareholders equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate effect on net income 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our interest rate sensitive securities will decrease 
conversely  as interest rates fall  the market value of our interest rate sensitive securities will increase 
for invested assets  modified duration modeling is used to calculate changes in fair values 
durations on invested assets are adjusted for call  put and interest rate reset features 
duration on tax exempt securities is adjusted for the fact that the yield on such securities is less sensitive to changes in interest rates compared to treasury securities 
invested asset portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  including accrued investment income  using holdings as of december  
table of contents the following table summarizes the effect that an immediate  parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve would have had on our portfolio at december  interest rate shift in basis points in thousands december  total market value market value change from base change in unrealized value equity price risk our portfolio of equity securities currently valued at million  which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value  has exposure to price risk 
this risk is defined as the potential loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in stock prices 
our us equity portfolio is benchmarked to the s p index and changes in that index may approximate the impact on our portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our lloyd s operations maintain both assets and liabilities in certain foreign currencies 
therefore  foreign exchange rate risk is generally limited to net assets denominated in those foreign currencies 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for us are the british pound  the euro and the canadian dollar
