item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in terms of revenue  we are the second largest publicly traded wholesale food distributor in the united states serving the retail grocery industry and the military commissary and exchange systems 
our business consists of three primary operating segments food distribution  military food distribution and retail 
our food distribution segment sells and distributes a wide variety of nationally branded and private label products to independent grocery stores and other customers primarily in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states 
our military segment contracts with manufacturers to distribute a wide variety of grocery products to military commissaries and exchanges located in the united states and the district of columbia  and in europe  puerto rico  cuba  the azores and egypt 
we have over years of experience acting as a distributor to us military commissaries and exchanges 
on january   we completed the purchase from gsc enterprises  inc  of substantially all of the assets relating to three wholesale food distribution centers located in san antonio  texas  pensacola  florida and junction city  kansas  including all inventory and customer contracts related to the purchased facilities gsc acquisition 
on december   we announced our purchase of a facility in columbus  georgia which is scheduled to begin servicing military commissaries and exchanges in the late third or fourth fiscal quarter of our retail segment operated corporate owned stores primarily in the upper midwest as of january  on april   we completed the acquisition of two stores located in rapid city  sd and scottsbluff  ne and on may  we opened an avanza store in aurora  co 
primarily due to highly competitive conditions in which supercenters and other alternative formats compete for price conscious customers  we closed or sold three retail stores in  four retail stores in and four retail stores in we are implementing initiatives of varying scope and duration with a view toward improving our response to and performance under these highly competitive conditions 
these initiatives include designing and reformatting some of our retail stores into alternative formats to increase overall retail sales performance 
as we continue to assess the impact of performance improvement initiatives and the operating results of individual stores  we may need to recognize additional impairments of long lived assets and goodwill associated with our retail segment  and may incur restructuring or other charges in connection with closure or sales activities 
the retail segment yields a higher gross profit percent of sales and higher selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percent of sales compared to our food distribution and military segments 
thus  changes in sales of the retail segment can have a disproportionate impact on consolidated gross profit and sg a as compared to similar changes in sales in our food distribution and military segments 
results of operations the following discussion summarizes our operating results for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal however  fiscal results are not directly comparable to fiscal or because fiscal contained an additional week

fiscal food distribution sales increased in comparison to fiscal but remained relatively flat in comparison to fiscal after adjusting for the additional week of sales 
however  fiscal sales included million of additional sales from a significant customer that transitioned to a different supplier during fiscal excluding the impact of this customer and the additional week of sales in fiscal  food distribution sales increased as compared to fiscal  primarily due to new account gains and an increase in sales to existing customers 
fiscal military sales increased in comparison to fiscal and increased in comparison to fiscal after excluding the additional week of sales in fiscal which is primarily attributable to the gsc acquisition 
however  after excluding the sales attributable to the acquired locations and the additional week of sales in fiscal  comparable military segment sales increased by in comparison to the prior year 
the comparable increase in military segment sales is due to stronger sales domestically 
fiscal military sales increased as compared to fiscal however  after excluding the additional week of sales in fiscal  military sales increased as compared to fiscal the sales increase reflected stronger sales domestically and stronger sales overseas as compared to fiscal  after adjusting for the additional week of sales in fiscal domestic and overseas sales represented the following percentages of military segment sales

gross profit consolidated gross profit for fiscal was of sales compared to for fiscal and for fiscal our fiscal gross profit margin was negatively affected by of sales in comparison to fiscal due to a sales mix shift between our business segments between the years 
this was due to a higher percentage of sales occurring in the military segment due to the gsc acquisition and a lower percentage in the retail and food distribution segments which have a higher gross profit margin 
in addition  high levels of inflation resulted in higher than normal prior year gross profit margin performance while declines in commodity prices during the current year have had a negative impact on gross profit performance 
fiscal consolidated gross profit was negatively impacted by additional year over year lifo charges of of sales  or million  and a sales mix shift between our business segments of of sales 
the negative impact of the sales mix shift was due to a higher percentage of sales occurring in the military segment  which has a lower gross profit margin than the retail or food distribution segments 
however  our gross profit margin increased of sales in fiscal relative to fiscal as a result of gains achieved from initiatives that focused on better management of inventories and vendor relationships 
inventory markdown and wind down costs related to retail store closings and retail markdown adjustments are included in cost of sales and were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively

the decrease in sg a attributable to this shift in revenues was approximately of sales in gain on sale of real estate the gain on sale of real estate for fiscal was million and was primarily related to the sale of unoccupied properties 
special charge a special charge of million was recognized in fiscal due to an asset impairment in our food distribution segment 
the charge was comprised of the write downs of million of leasehold improvements and million of fixtures and equipment 
in fiscal  we recorded a reversal of million of previously established lease reserves for one location after subleasing the property earlier than anticipated 
this reversal was partially offset by a charge of million due to revised lease commitment estimates 
gain on acquisition of a business a gain on the acquisition of a business of million net of tax was recognized during fiscal related to the gsc acquisition 
the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of million exceeded the fair value of the purchase price of the business of million 
consequently  we reassessed the recognition and measurement of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and concluded that the valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate

other items impacting the rate include the litigation settlement related to roundy s of million  the gain on the acquisition of the gsc assets of million  and a refund on a claim made with the internal revenue service of million 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was impacted by the reversal of previously unrecognized tax benefits of million  primarily due to the filing of reports with various taxing authorities which resulted in the settlement of uncertain tax positions  a refund on a claim made with the internal revenue service of million and an increase in reserves of million 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was also impacted by the reversal of previously unrecognized tax benefits of million  primarily due to statute of limitation expirations  audit resolutions  and the filing of reports with various taxing authorities which resulted in the settlement of uncertain tax positions

liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our capital needs through a combination of internal and external sources 
we expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and enable us to reduce our debt  with temporary draws on our revolving credit line needed during the year to build inventories for certain holidays 
longer term  we believe that cash flows from operations  short term bank borrowings  various types of long term debt and lease and equity financing will be adequate to meet our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations

the year over year increase in our accounts receivable was due to a temporary timing difference related to our military accounts receivable billing cycle that accelerated collections into the last week of fiscal and the decrease in year over year accrued expense was primarily due to decreases in certain variable employee compensation and benefit expense accruals 
operating cash flows were million for fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the primary reasons for the fiscal increase in operating cash flows were due to year over year decreases in accounts and notes receivable of million due to increased collections and a year over year increase in income taxes payable of million

asset backed credit agreement on april   we entered into our credit agreement which is an asset backed loan consisting of a million revolving credit facility  which includes a million letter of credit sub facility the revolving credit facility 
provided no default is then existing or would arise  we may from time to time  request that the revolving credit facility be increased by an aggregate amount for all such requests not to exceed million 
the revolving credit facility has a year term and will be due and payable in full on april  we can elect  at the time of borrowing  for loans to bear interest at a rate equal to the base rate or libor plus a margin 
the libor interest rate margin currently is and can vary quarterly in increments between three pricing levels ranging from to based on the excess availability  which is defined in the credit agreement as a the lesser of i the borrowing base  or ii the aggregate commitments  minus b the aggregate of the outstanding credit extensions 
the credit agreement contains no financial covenants unless and until i the continuance of an event of default under the credit agreement  or ii the failure of us to maintain excess availability a greater than of the borrowing base for more than two consecutive business days or b greater than of the borrowing base at any time  in which event  we must comply with a trailing month basis consolidated fixed charge covenant ratio of  which ratio shall continue to be tested each month thereafter until excess availability exceeds of the borrowing base for ninety consecutive days 
the credit agreement contains standard covenants requiring us  among other things  to maintain collateral  comply with applicable laws  keep proper books and records  preserve the corporate existence  maintain insurance  and pay taxes in a timely manner

at january   million was available under the revolving credit facility after giving effect to outstanding borrowings and to million of outstanding letters of credit primarily supporting workers 
table of contents compensation obligations 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants contained within the credit agreement 
our revolving credit facility represents one of our primary sources of liquidity  both short term and long term  and the continued availability of credit under that agreement is of material importance to our ability to fund our capital and working capital needs 
senior subordinated convertible debt on march   we completed a private placement of million in aggregate issue price or million aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior subordinated convertible notes due the funds were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions from roundy s 
the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations and rank junior to our existing and future senior indebtedness  including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility 
cash interest at the rate of per year is payable semi annually on the issue price of the notes until march  after that date  cash interest will not be payable  unless contingent cash interest becomes payable  and original issue discount for non tax purposes will accrue on the notes at a daily rate of per year until the maturity date of the notes 
on the maturity date of the notes  a holder will receive  per note 
contingent cash interest will be paid on the notes during any six month period  commencing march   if the average market price of a note for a ten trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals or more of the accreted principal amount of the note  plus accrued cash interest  if any 
the contingent cash interest payable with respect to any six month period will equal an annual rate of of the average market price of the note for the ten trading day measurement period described above 
the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder  only upon the occurrence of certain events  at an adjusted conversion rate of shares initially of our common stock per  principal amount at maturity of notes equal to an adjusted conversion price of approximately per share 
upon conversion  we will pay the holder the conversion value in cash up to the accreted principal amount of the note and the excess conversion value  if any  in cash  stock or a combination of both  at our option 
we may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after the eighth anniversary of the issuance of the notes 
holders may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes on the th  th  th  th and th anniversaries of the issuance of the notes 
in addition  upon specified change in control events  each holder will have the option  subject to certain limitations  to require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of such holder s notes 
in connection with the closing of the sale of the notes  we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the notes 
in accordance with that agreement  we filed with the securities and exchange commission on july   a shelf registration statement covering the resale by security holders of the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
the shelf registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on october  our contractual obligation  however  to maintain the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement has expired

ebitda is defined as net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
consolidated ebitda excludes certain non cash charges and other items that management does not utilize in assessing operating performance and is a metric used to determine payout of performance units pursuant to our short term and long term incentive plans 
the above table reconciles net earnings to ebitda and consolidated ebitda 
not all companies utilize identical calculations  therefore  the presentation of ebitda and consolidated ebitda may not be comparable to other identically titled measures of other companies 
neither ebitda or consolidated ebitda are recognized terms under gaap and do not purport to be an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of operating performance or any other gaap measure 
in addition  ebitda and consolidated ebitda are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management s discretionary 
table of contents use since they do not consider certain cash requirements  such as interest payments  tax payments and capital expenditures 
derivative instruments we have market risk exposure to changing interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities and commodity price risk associated with anticipated purchases of diesel fuel 
our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
from time to time we use derivative instruments  primarily interest rate and commodity swap agreements  to manage risk exposures when appropriate  based on market conditions 
we do not enter into derivative agreements for trading or other speculative purposes  nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet and the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income 
deferred gains and losses are amortized as an adjustment to expense over the same period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in income 
however  to the extent that any of these contracts are not considered to be effective in accordance with asc topic asc  originally issued as sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in offsetting the change in the value of the items being hedged  any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts are immediately recognized in income 
as of january   we had two outstanding interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million 
the notional amounts of the two outstanding swaps are reduced annually as follows amounts in thousands notional effective date termination date fixed rate notional effective date termination date fixed rate from time to time we use commodity swap agreements to reduce price risk associated with anticipated purchases of diesel fuel 
the agreements call for an exchange of payments with us making payments based on fixed price per gallon and receiving payments based on floating prices  without an exchange of the underlying commodity amount upon which the payments are made 
resulting gains and losses on the fair market value of the commodity swap agreement are immediately recognized as income or expense 
as of january   there were no commodity swap agreements in existence 
our only commodity swap agreement in place during fiscal expired during the first quarter and was settled for fair market value 
pre tax gains of million were recorded as a reduction to cost of sales during fiscal in addition to the previously discussed interest rate and commodity swap agreements  from time to time we enter into fixed price fuel supply agreements to support our food distribution segment 
on january   we entered into an agreement which required us to purchase a total of  gallons of diesel fuel per month at prices ranging from to per gallon 
the term of the agreement was for one year and expired on december  during fiscal and we had a fixed price fuel supply agreement which required us to purchase a total of  gallons of diesel fuel per month at prices ranging from to per gallon 
the term of the agreement began on february   and expired on december  these fixed price fuel agreements qualified for the normal purchase exception under asc  therefore the fuel purchases under these contracts are expensed as incurred as an increase to cost of sales 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of the date of this report  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our financial statements 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical and could result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions customer exposure and credit risk allowance for doubtful accounts methodology 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts and notes receivable based on a combination of factors 
in most circumstances when we become aware of factors that may indicate a deterioration in a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  reductions of product purchases  deteriorating store conditions  changes in payment patterns  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
in determining the adequacy of the reserves  we analyze factors such as the value of any collateral  customer financial statements  historical collection experience  aging of receivables and other economic and industry factors 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the collectability based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts 
if circumstances change ie  further evidence of material adverse creditworthiness  additional accounts become credit risks  store closures  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount  including to zero 
lease commitments 
we have historically leased store sites for sublease to qualified independent retailers at rates that are at least as high as the rent paid by us 
under terms of the original lease agreements  we remain primarily liable for any commitments an independent retailer may no longer be financially able to satisfy 
we also lease store sites for our retail segment 
should a retailer be unable to perform under a sublease or should we close underperforming corporate stores  we record a charge to earnings for costs of the remaining term of the lease  less any anticipated sublease income 
calculating the estimated losses requires that significant estimates and judgments be made by management 
our reserves for such properties can be materially affected by factors such as the extent of interested sub lessees and their creditworthiness  our ability to negotiate early termination agreements with lessors  general economic conditions and the demand for commercial property 
should the number of defaults by sub lessees or corporate store closures materially increase  the remaining lease commitments we must record could have a material adverse effect on operating results and cash flows 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of lease commitments 
guarantees of debt and lease obligations of others 
we have guaranteed the debt and lease obligations of certain food distribution customers 
in the event these retailers are unable to meet their debt service 
table of contents payments or otherwise experience an event of default  we would be unconditionally liable for the outstanding balance of their debt and lease obligations million as of january  as compared to million as of january   which would be due in accordance with the underlying agreements 
we have entered into loan and lease guarantees on behalf of certain food distribution customers that are accounted for under asc topic asc  originally issued as fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
asc provides that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
the maximum undiscounted payments we would be required to make in the event of default under the guarantees is million  which is included in the million total referenced above 
these guarantees are secured by certain business assets and personal guarantees of the respective customers 
we believe these customers will be able to perform under the lease agreements and that no payments will be required and no loss will be incurred under the guarantees 
as required by asc  a liability representing the fair value of the obligations assumed under the guarantees of million is included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
all of the other guarantees were issued prior to december  and therefore not subject to the recognition and measurement provisions of asc we have also assigned various leases to certain food distribution customers and other third parties 
if the assignees were to become unable to continue making payments under the assigned leases  we estimate our maximum potential obligation with respect to the assigned leases  net of reserves  to be approximately million as of january  as compared to million as of january  in circumstances when we become aware of factors that indicate deterioration in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations guaranteed or assigned by us  we record a specific reserve in the amount we reasonably believe we will be obligated to pay on the customer s behalf  net of any anticipated recoveries from the customer 
in determining the adequacy of these reserves  we analyze factors such as those described above in allowance for doubtful accounts methodology and lease commitments 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the obligations based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on operating results and cash flows 
triggering these guarantees or obligations under assigned leases would not  however  result in cross default of our debt  but could restrict resources available for general business initiatives

impairment of long lived assets property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with asc subtopic originally issued as sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
estimates of future results are often influenced by assessments of changes in competition  merchandising strategies  human resources and general market conditions  which may result in not recognizing an impairment loss 
impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount 
we generally determine fair value by discounting expected future cash flows at a rate which management has determined to be consistent with assumptions used by market participants 
the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the impairment charge 
actual outcomes may differ from the estimates 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation of future results could be materially affected by 
table of contents different judgments as to competition  strategies and market conditions  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on financial condition and operating results 
goodwill we maintain three reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing  which are the same as our reporting segments disclosed in part ii  item of this report under note segment reporting 
goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment in accordance with asc annually and or when factors indicating impairment are present  which requires a significant amount of management s judgment 
such indicators may include a decline in our expected future cash flows  unanticipated competition  the loss of a major customer  slower growth rates or a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  among others 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of our goodwill and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we began applying the provision of asc topic originally issued as sfas no 
 fair value measurements in relation to our goodwill impairment testing by applying  to the extent possible  observable market inputs to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units 
our fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an income approach which incorporates a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach that utilizes current earnings multiples for comparable publically traded companies 
our income approach is based on an estimate of five years of future cash flows and a terminal value that factors in estimated long term growth 
the estimate of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist  including operating performance  economic conditions  long term growth rates  capital expenditures  changes in working capital and effective tax rates 
the discount rates applied to the income approach reflect a weighted average cost of capital for comparable publicly traded companies which are adjusted for equity and size risk premiums based on market capitalization 
we have weighted the valuation of our reporting units at based on the income approach and based on the market approach 
we believe that this weighting is appropriate since it is often difficult to find other appropriate publicly traded companies that are similar to our reporting units and it is our view that future discounted cash flows are more reflective of the value of the reporting units 
our estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as competitive forces  customer behaviors  changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on financial condition and operating results potentially resulting in impairment of the goodwill 
none of the reporting units are more susceptible to economic conditions than others 
the income approach and market approach used to determine fair value are sensitive to changes in discount rates and market trading multiples 
while we believe our estimates of fair value of our reporting units are reasonable  there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions  customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur  resulting in a goodwill impairment loss 
please refer to part ii  item in this report under note summary of significant accounting policies under the caption goodwill and intangible assets of this form k for additional information pertaining to our fiscal goodwill impairment analysis 
income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our results of operations  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the period the unusual or one time item occurred 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in asc topic originally issued as sfas  accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred taxes are 
table of contents determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse or are settled 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in our tax provision in the period of change 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions could be challenged and we may ultimately not prevail in defending our positions 
these reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the expiration of statutes of limitations 
the effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as  related penalties and interest 
these reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by taxing authorities 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
reserves for self insurance we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  general and automobile liability and health insurance costs 
it is our policy to record our self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
worker s compensation  general and automobile liabilities are actuarially determined on a discounted basis 
we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis 
on a per claim basis  our exposure for workers compensation is million  auto liability and general liability is million and for health insurance our exposure is million 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation  general and automobile and health insurance liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  such changes could have a material impact on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 
a basis point change in discount rates would increase our liability by approximately million 
vendor allowances and credits as is common in our industry  we use a third party service to undertake accounts payable audits on an ongoing basis 
these audits examine vendor allowances offered to us during a given year as well as cash discounts  freight allowances and duplicate payments and establish a basis for us to recover overpayments made to vendors 
we reduce future payments to vendors based on the results of these audits  at which time we also establish reserves for commissions payable to the third party service provider as well as for amounts that may not be collected 
we also establish reserves for future repayments to vendors for disputed payment deductions related to accounts payable audits  promotional allowances and other items 
although our estimates of reserves do not anticipate changes in our historical payback rates  such changes could have a material impact on our currently recorded reserves 
share based compensation on january   we adopted asc topic asc  originally issued as sfas no 
r  share based payment revised using the modified prospective transition method 
beginning in  our results of operations reflect compensation expense for newly issued stock options and other forms of share based compensation granted under our stock incentive plans  for the unvested portion of previously issued stock options and other forms of share based compensation granted  and for our employee stock purchase plan 
asc requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant 
the company uses the grant date closing price per share of nash finch common stock to estimate the fair value of restricted stock units rsus and performance units granted pursuant to its long term incentive plan 
table of contents ltip 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options 
the company uses a lattice model to estimate the fair value of stock appreciation rights sars which contain market conditions 
the value of the portion of the awards ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period which is derived from the data in the lattice valuation model 
share based compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  and is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
asc requires forfeitures be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ materially from those estimates 
significant judgment is required in selecting the assumptions used for estimating fair value of share based compensation as well estimating forfeiture rates 
further  any awards with performance conditions that can affect vesting also add additional judgment in determining the amount expected to vest 
there can be significant volatility in many of our assumptions and therefore our estimates of fair value  forfeitures  etc 
are sensitive to changes in these assumptions 
new accounting standards in may  the fasb amended asc originally issued as fasb staff position apb  accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants  which impacts the accounting associated with our existing million senior convertible notes 
asc requires us to recognize non cash interest expense based on the market rate for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature 
furthermore  it requires recognizing interest expense in prior periods pursuant to retrospective accounting treatment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure in the financial markets consists of changes in interest rates relative to our investment in notes receivable  the balance of our debt obligations outstanding and derivatives employed from time to time to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and diesel fuel prices 
we do not use financial instruments or derivatives for any trading or other speculative purposes 
we carry notes receivable because  in the normal course of business  we make long term loans to certain retail customers 
substantially all notes receivable are based on floating interest rates which adjust to changes in market rates 
as a result  the carrying value of notes receivable approximates market value
