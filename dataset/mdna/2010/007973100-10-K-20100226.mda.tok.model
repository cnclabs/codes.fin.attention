see business special note regarding forward looking statements in item of this report for additional factors relating to such statements  and see risk factors beginning on page for a discussion of certain risks applicable to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
business overview and presentation our financial results for the year ended december  reflected significantly reduced demand for manufacturing equipment and services due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions 
negative trends in consumer spending and pervasive economic uncertainty led many of our customers to significantly reduce factory operations and to reduce their projected capital spending plans for capacity expansion  particularly during the first half of  which severely impacted demand for our products 
in the second half of  demand for semiconductor equipment increased as compared to the first half of  but was still down significantly from levels 
while we achieved profitability in the fourth quarter of  a meaningful improvement in the equipment sector in will depend on a sustainable recovery in our customers end markets to support factories running at higher utilization rates  which will drive expansion in existing technologies  and to encourage customers to make investments in capacity for new technologies 
in this uncertain macroeconomic and industry climate  our ability to forecast customer demand and our future performance is limited 
we currently expect a recovery in  particularly in the market for semiconductor capital equipment  and anticipate that total sales may increase substantially in as compared to we believe our investments in new technology  which has remained strong during these challenging market conditions  will position us well during this anticipated market recovery 
throughout and  we implemented cost reduction efforts in response to the deteriorating economic conditions and weakening demand from our end markets described above 
some of the cost reductions were permanent in nature  such as reductions of personnel across all functions and geographies and consolidation of facilities on a worldwide basis 
overall  we reduced our global workforce by approximately people  or of total headcount  across all functions and geographies since the beginning of 
table of contents we expect the cost savings from this workforce reduction to be million annually  of which approximately million is a reduction in cost of goods sold  approximately million is a reduction of selling  general and administrative costs and million is a reduction of research and development costs 
in  we also implemented cost cutting initiatives that were more temporary in nature 
temporary cost reductions  implemented in  provided savings of approximately million 
these activities included cuts in discretionary spending  such as travel and professional fees  as well as pay cuts for management level personnel  company wide shutdowns and benefit cuts 
these temporary cuts enabled us to maintain lower cost levels throughout and until such time that we felt the positive trends observed in the second half of may be sustainable 
as of january   a majority of the temporary cost cutting initiatives described above have been reversed 
our analysis presented below is organized to provide the information we believe will be instructive for understanding our historical performance and relevant trends going forward 
however  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this report  including the notes thereto

table of contents sales the following tables summarize annual net sales and percentages of net sales by customer type for each of the years ended  and years ended december  increase decrease percentage change v v v v in thousands in thousands semiconductor capital equipment non semiconductor equipment global support total sales years ended december  semiconductor capital equipment non semiconductor equipment global support overall sales decreased by in as compared to  reflecting significantly reduced demand for manufacturing equipment and services due to extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions 
applied materials inc  our largest customer  accounted for million  or  of our sales in as compared to million  or  of our sales in our sales to applied materials include sales for the semiconductor capital equipment market  as well as the solar  flat panel display and architectural glass markets 
sales to the semiconductor capital equipment market decreased in as compared to as end market demand for products that include semiconductors fell in the wake of the global economic crisis 
the drop in demand reduced factory utilization and significantly reduced the need for semiconductor fab expansion 
the semiconductor capital equipment market was severely affected by these developments and  consequently  demand for our products in these markets decreased from year ago levels 
as described above  there were positive trends in semiconductor demand in the second half of and we anticipate growth in sales to the semiconductor capital equipment market in sales to our non semiconductor equipment markets declined in as compared to as these markets were also adversely affected by a number of the pervasive factors previously mentioned  such as the credit constraints in the financial markets and the negative trends in consumer spending 
the drop in end market demand reduced factory utilization and significantly reduced the need for capacity expansion in our non semiconductor markets 
the markets that comprise our non semiconductor equipment markets include solar  flat panel display  data storage  architectural glass  and other industrial thin film manufacturing equipment 
our customers in these markets  other than the solar market  are predominantly large original equipment manufacturers oem s for new equipment 
our customers in the solar inverter market are predominantly large system integrators  independent power producers and public utilities 
over the past three years  the solar market has been growing the fastest of our non semiconductor equipment markets  however  product sales to this market were adversely affected by the weakness in the global economy and the global financial crisis which began in the second half of and continued through solar panel manufacturers installed substantial panel manufacturing capacity over the past three years  and as a result of declining panel sales caused in part by the global recession  built significant inventory 
the majority of solar panel manufacturers must work through their current inventory levels before their factory utilization will be at a point where the solar panel manufacturers will need to expand capacity 
as a result  sales to customers in the solar market decreased in as compared to our products are used in the thin film deposition process for solar cell production  such as amorphous silicon  polysilicon  amorphous microcrystalline silicon  cadmium telluride cdte  copper indium gallium selenide cigs and copper indium selenide cis 
sales of our solaron solar inverter  which converts dc power generated by the solar panel to ac power  are included in sales to the solar market 
just as in our semiconductor market  demand for our products is driven by requirements for capacity expansion in each of the non semiconductor markets we serve 
we experienced sequential growth in our non semiconductor business in the second half of 
table of contents although visibility in the non semiconductor market is unclear  we anticipate expansion to drive growth in these markets 
we anticipate a continued shift in our business towards our non semiconductor equipment markets as we continue to invest in new technology and products for the solar market 
sales from our global support business decreased in as compared to in large part from a continuing practice by our customers of utilizing spare parts inventory and idle equipment for spare parts in efforts to conserve cash as opposed to repairing malfunctioning or worn parts 
however  we did experience growth in global support sales in the second half of as compared to the first half 
this is an indication that factory utilization is beginning to improve and that customers no longer have enough inventory of spare parts to maintain their production lines 
as a result  we anticipate our global support business to experience higher levels of sales in than in overall sales decreased by in as compared to  reflecting decreased demand for semiconductor equipment  due to unfavorable market conditions in the semiconductor industry 
sales to the semiconductor capital equipment market decreased in as compared to this decrease was partially offset by sales to the non semiconductor equipment market  which increased in as compared to our investments in capacity for solar panel production lines in drove this growth in our non semiconductor capital equipment market 
sales from our global support business increased in as compared to  reflecting a higher installed base of customers ordering service and system enhancements 
gross profit our gross profit was million  or of revenue  in   or of revenue  in and million  or of revenue  in the large decrease in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in as compared to was due to an overall decrease in sales and the associated reduction in production volume related to the weakness in the economy which resulted in a lack of absorption of our factory costs therefore reducing our gross margin 
in response to the decrease in production volume in we reduced our overall manufacturing costs by reducing fixed production and overhead costs including personnel costs and discretionary spending through the cost cutting activities described earlier in this section 
overall  production and overhead personnel costs decreased by million  materials and supplies decreased by million  travel decreased by million and professional fees decreased by million 
the decrease in our gross profit  in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue  in as compared to was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue in the semiconductor capital equipment market which impacted utilization  and additional costs incurred in transitioning additional manufacturing from the united states to shenzhen  china  as well as a decrease in the value of the us dollar  which resulted in increased material costs from our key european and japanese suppliers 
additionally  as a result of the weakening global economy  current market conditions and changing customer demand  we reviewed our end of life product and inventory strategies and our excess and obsolete inventory reserve policies in we determined that the uncertain market conditions negatively affected the longer term demand for our parts and components on hand 
this change in estimate resulted in an approximately million increase to our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory  therefore increasing cost of goods sold and decreasing gross profit 
maintaining lower cost levels allowed us to substantially improve our gross margin percentage to in the second half of as compared to in the first half of although we currently have excess manufacturing capacity related to buildings  machinery and unabsorbed overhead expenses  we anticipate continued improvement in our gross profit and gross margin percentage in 
table of contents operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the years ended  and years ended december  in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative impairment of goodwill amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges total operating expenses research and development the markets we serve constantly present us with opportunities to develop our products for new or emerging applications and require technological changes driving for higher performance  lower cost  and other attributes that will advance our customers products 
we believe that continued and timely development of new and differentiated products  as well as enhancements to existing products to support customer requirements  is critical for us to compete in the markets we serve 
accordingly  we devote significant personnel and financial resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  and we expect these investments to continue 
all of our research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
research and development costs were million  or of sales  in  million  or of sales  in  and million  or of sales  in the decrease in research and development expenses of million in as compared to was driven primarily by decreases of million in personnel costs  million in engineering material  and million in travel costs 
the large decrease in engineering material was offset by an approximate million charge for excess and obsolete engineering inventory  for which management does not believe there will be utilizable demand 
overall  the decrease in material costs was due to more effective spending controls related to engineering projects 
the increase in research and development expenses of million in as compared to was driven primarily by increased personnel costs of million and material expenses of million related to the development of new platforms and the costs associated with sustaining engineering of existing platforms 
in we released the solaron kw  solaron e and the solaron kw to the solar inverter market  and the paramount and ascent to the rf and dc markets  respectively 
selling  general and administrative our selling expenses support domestic and international sales and marketing activities that include personnel  trade shows  advertising  third party sales representative commissions and other selling and marketing activities 
our general and administrative expenses support our worldwide corporate  legal  tax  financial  governance  administrative  information systems and human resource functions in addition to our general management 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs were million  or of sales in  million  or of sales in  and million  or of sales in continued reduction of personnel related costs and other discretionary costs drove overall sg a costs lower by million in as compared to personnel costs decreased by million  purchased services decreased by million  and travel was reduced by million in as compared to  offset by a million increase in bad debt expense 
the increase in bad debt expense in was a result of certain customers deteriorating financial condition 
while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts at december  is adequate  we will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and other economic conditions 
the decrease in sg a costs in as compared to was a result of the reductions of personnel and related costs aimed at reducing administrative burden and increasing efficiencies 
overall  sg a costs decreased by million in as compared to personnel costs decreased by million  travel was reduced by million  and third party sales compensation to independent sales representatives was million lower due to a decrease in overall sales revenue 

table of contents restructuring charges restructuring costs are related to actions we took primarily in response to downturns in our markets 
these costs were incurred to exit an activity or cancel an existing contractual obligation  including the closure of facilities and employee termination related charges 
as discussed earlier in this section  we implemented cost reduction efforts in response to deteriorating economic conditions and weakening demand from our end markets 
as a result  we incurred restructuring costs of million in the costs incurred were primarily severance and benefits related to reductions in personnel 
we continue to look for ways to make our global workforce more efficient and effective  which may lead to additional cost reduction activities in the future 
in  we recognized restructuring costs of million  of which million was associated with global cost reduction plans with respect to reductions in personnel implemented at various times throughout the year 
the remaining million of restructuring charges recognized in were a result of a plan to transition the production of a number of our legacy products from our manufacturing facility in fort collins  colorado to our manufacturing facility in shenzhen  china 
this activity in led to the elimination of approximately positions on a worldwide basis 
in  we closed our operation in stolberg  germany 
related to this closure  we recorded restructuring charges of million  consisting primarily of impairment on real and personal property and employee severance and benefit costs associated with the reduction of employees at the facility 
goodwill impairment charge we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge in the amount of million in based upon the results of our impairment test performed during the first quarter of for further discussion of the goodwill impairment charge recorded  see note goodwill  purchased technology and other intangible assets to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
other income expense other income expense consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous gains  losses  income and expense items 
other income was million in  million in  and million in the decrease of million in as compared to was the result of lower interest income as interest rates available in the financial markets in were considerably lower than in the decrease of million in as compared to was primarily driven by a million decrease in interest income and a net million loss related to the valuation of our auction rate securities and put agreement 
the decrease related to interest income was a result of lower interest rates being offered in the financial markets and a decrease in our invested funds due to a million buyback of the company s stock 
provision for income taxes during  based on our operating results and projection of future operating results within the united states  our management evaluated the recoverability of our deferred tax assets in the united states and concluded a portion of our united states deferred tax assets were not recoverable 
as such  an increase to the valuation allowance of million was recorded during the quarter ended december  for the first three quarters of  we continued to sustain losses in the united states and  as a result  an increase to the valuation allowance of million was necessary since management had determined that we were not likely to utilize the benefits of the associated deferred tax assets 
at that time  we had recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million and the ultimate realization of our overall deferred tax assets was dependent upon the generation of approximately million of future taxable income in the united states  the timing and amount of which was uncertain 

table of contents in the second half of  we reconfigured our legal entity structure to realign our chinese manufacturing operations with the intellectual property utilized in such manufacturing 
on december   we transferred the economic rights to our patents and know how from other affiliates throughout the world  including the parent company 
as a result of this realignment  we generated million of taxable income in the united states and japan and  thus  reversed a portion of our valuation allowance and will utilize previously reserved deferred tax assets upon filing of our tax return 
overall  we recorded an income tax provision in of million 
the provision was driven primarily by million of tax on income in foreign jurisdictions and million of federal income tax  which was comprised of million of expense related to uncertain tax positions offset by million of federal benefit 
the remainder related to a million benefit for state taxes 
the income tax expense of million in was the result of an million increase to our valuation allowance recorded in the fourth quarter of and a change in the profitability mix between the us and our global subsidiaries  whereby more income was generated at our lower income tax subsidiaries during than in the we anticipate that the entity restructuring discussed previously in this annual report on form k will improve efficiency  streamline processes and properly align intellectual property and the related expenses with the manufacturing operations undertaken in china 
as a result  we believe we will see worldwide tax savings related to the new structure over time resulting in an overall lower effective rate on consolidated earnings 
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation and the geographic composition of our pre tax income 
we carefully monitor these factors and timely adjust our effective income tax rate accordingly 
quarterly results of operations the following tables present unaudited quarterly results in dollars and as a percentage of sales for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly such quarterly information

however  we continuously monitor operating price increases  particularly in connection with the supply of component parts used in our manufacturing process 
to the extent permitted by competition  we pass increased costs on to our customers by increasing sales prices over time 
sales price increases  however  were not significant in any of the years presented herein 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance on accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies  which amends the provisions related to the initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination under previously 
table of contents issued guidance 
the authoritative guidance requires that such contingencies be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be reasonably estimated during the allocation period 
this authoritative guidance will be effective for us in we expect that this authoritative guidance will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  term and size of acquired contingencies  if any 
from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  our management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are our available cash levels and available liquidity from our credit line agreement and put agreement 
we utilize these capital resources to make capital expenditures primarily for our operational needs  investment in technology applications and tools to further develop our products and for other general corporate purposes  including the funding of possible acquisitions 
in future periods  we intend similar uses of these funds 
during the twelve months ended december   we generated million in cash from net changes in marketable securities  million from operating activities and million of proceeds from stock option exercises  offset by the use of million for capital expenditures  resulting in a million increase in available cash including million of unfavorable effects of international currency exchange rates on cash 
net cash flows provided by operating activities in the twelve months ended december  were million  compared to million of cash provided by operating activities in the twelve months ended december  the million decrease in net cash flows from operating activities was due to a million decrease in net income  offset by a million increase in non cash reconciling items such as goodwill impairment  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  restructuring charges  provision for excess and obsolete inventory  provision for doubtful accounts and deferred income taxes  and a million increase in cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities  principally the depletion of inventory  collection of receivables and cash generated from an increase in accounts payable 
the increase in accounts payable from december  as compared to december  was primarily the result of a decision to extend payment terms to our vendors 
capital expenditures were million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  capital expenditures in both periods presented primarily include the cost of lab and testing equipment to support sustaining engineering and new product development efforts as well as capacity expansion for the production of our solaron inverter 
at december   our ars  whose underlying assets are primarily student loans originated under the federal family education loan program ffelp  had a fair value of million 
ffelp student loans are guaranteed by state guarantors who have reinsurance agreements with the united states department of education 
in addition to the student loans  a smaller portion of our portfolio is held in municipal securities 
since february  the auctions for these securities have failed to settle  causing us to hold the securities longer than originally intended 
in november  we executed the put agreement and expect to liquidate all of our remaining ars at par when our rights under the agreement are effective beginning june  since the period for which this put agreement is effective within twelve months and it is management s intent to liquidate the securities at the effective date  we have reclassified our ars from long term assets to current assets 
we do not expect to incur any loss of principal  however  until we liquidate our ars  we will recognize any change in fair value of the ars in earnings 
we expect the subsequent changes in the value of the put agreement will largely offset any subsequent fair value changes of the ars  subject to the continued performance by the financial institution of its obligations under the put agreement 
other than via the put agreement  the principal could become available pursuant to one of three different scenarios the ars is called  auctions resume and are successful  or the principal reaches maturity 
on june   pursuant to the put agreement  we entered into a credit line account agreement with ubs bank 
at december   the credit line agreement provides us with an uncommitted  demand revolving line of credit an intended no net cost loan of million of par value of our ars  as determined by ubs bank in its sole discretion  which is secured by our ars 
upon our request  ubs bank may make one or more advances to us 
any interest expense that we incur on the no net cost loan is not expected to exceed the interest income that we receive on the ars that we have pledged to ubs bank 
if the payments on our ars are not sufficient to pay the accrued interest on such advances before a due date  ubs bank may  in 
table of contents its sole discretion capitalize unpaid interest as an additional advance or require us to make payment of all accrued and unpaid interest 
ubs bank may demand full or partial payment of the no net cost loan  at its sole option and without cause  at any time 
ubs bank may also  at any time  in its discretion  terminate and cancel the no net cost loan 
if at any time ubs bank exercises its right of demand under certain sections of the credit line agreement  then ubs financial services inc or one of its affiliates shall provide  as soon as reasonably possible  alternative financing on substantially the same terms and conditions as those under the credit line agreement and the credit line agreement will remain in full force and effect until such time as such alternative financing has been established 
as of december   no advances were drawn against the line 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including our ars and the put agreement 
we believe that our current cash levels and cash flows from future operations will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs  anticipated levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined under item a of regulation s k 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our future payments due under contractual obligations as of december  in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total as of december   we have million in uncertain tax positions  net of federal benefit 
because of the uncertainty of the amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments  these liabilities are not reflected in the contractual obligations table 
purchase obligations include firm commitments and agreements with various suppliers to ensure the availability of components 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
specifically  these policies have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled risk factors 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with us gaap 
table of contents  and provide a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the following are critical accounting estimates that have a continuing effect on the results of our operations and our financial position warranty costs we offer warranty coverage for a majority of our products for periods typically ranging from to months after shipment 
we warrant our solar inverter for five years  and also offer extended warranties on our solaron products in increments of five years up to an additional ten years 
we estimate the anticipated costs of repairing products under warranty based on the historical or expected cost of the repairs and expected failure rates 
the assumptions used to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated quarterly  at a minimum  in light of actual experience and  when appropriate  the accruals or the accrual percentage is adjusted based on specific estimates of project repair costs and quantity of product returns 
our determination of the appropriate level of warranty accrual is based on estimates of the percentage of units affected and the repair costs 
estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale of the related product  and are recorded within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
the following table summarizes the activity in our warranty reserve during the twelve months ended december   and in thousands balance at beginning of period additions charged to expense deductions balance at end of period excess and obsolete inventory reserves are provided for excess and obsolete inventory  which are estimated based on a comparison of the quantity of inventory on hand to management s forecast of customer demand 
customer demand is dependent on many factors  including both micro and macroeconomic  and requires us to use significant judgment in our forecasting process 
we must also make assumptions regarding the rate at which new products will be accepted in the marketplace  the rate at which customers will transition from older products to newer products  effect of engineering changes to a product or discontinuance of a product line 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional valuation adjustments may be necessary 
we will continue to evaluate the estimates related to our excess and obsolete inventory reserve 
if market conditions and customer demand continue to weaken in future periods  we may determine that increases in our reserve and  therefore  further increases in cost of goods sold and decreases in gross profit may be necessary 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts of million  or of accounts receivable  as of december  for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our estimate is based on factors surrounding the credit risk of certain customers  historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable 
it is reasonably possible that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments 
fair value of investments we value our financial assets and liabilities using fair value measurements 
fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements  a fair value hierarchy is used that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels  which are described below level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to level inputs 
level observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets  but corroborated by direct or indirect market data 
level unobservable inputs  developed using our estimates and assumptions  which reflect those that market participants would use 
such inputs are used when little or no market data is available 
the fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to level inputs 

table of contents the fair value of our ars and the put agreement were determined using level inputs 
some of the inputs into the discounted cash flow models we use are unobservable in the market and have a significant effect on valuation 
the assumptions used in preparing the models include  but are not limited to  periodic coupon rates  market required rates of return and the expected term of each security 
the coupon rate was estimated using implied forward rate data on interest rate swaps and united states treasuries  and limited where necessary by any contractual maximum rate paid under a scenario of continuing auction failures 
we believe implied forward rates inherently account for a lack of liquidity 
in making assumptions of the required rates of return  we considered risk free interest rates and credit spreads for investments of similar credit quality 
the expected term for the ars was based on a weighted probability based estimate of the time the principal will become available to us with and without exercising our put agreement 
the expected term for the put agreement was based on the earliest date on which we can exercise our put 
any change to these inputs will affect the fair value of the ars and the put agreement and will affect our reported earnings 
however  we do not expect changes in the inputs or reported earnings to affect our liquidity 
income taxes we assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
our assessment includes a number of factors  including historical results and income projections for each jurisdiction 
as of september   we had gross deferred income tax assets of million in the united states and million in foreign jurisdictions  a significant portion of which related to net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards  for which a valuation allowance of million had been provided 
the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on the generation of taxable income in appropriate jurisdictions during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in determining the amount of the valuation allowance 
based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible  management determines if we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
the most significant factors considered in determining the realizability of these deferred tax assets and the amount of the valuation allowance were our profitability over the past three years which excludes the effect of the non deductible goodwill charge recorded during the quarter ended march   the historical cyclicality of the markets in which we operate and our projected profitability during these cycles 
in the second half of  we reconfigured our legal entity structure to realign our chinese manufacturing operations with the intellectual property utilized in such manufacturing 
as a result of this realignment  we generated million of taxable income in the united states and japan and  thus  reversed a portion of our valuation allowance and will utilize previously reserved deferred tax assets upon filing of our tax return 
in general  we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our tax estimates and reserves  including those for uncertain tax positions  are reasonable  including those relied upon in the execution of our entity restructuring  there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our current or historical income tax provisions and accruals  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
the calculation of tax assets and liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates in our investment portfolio 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of december   our investments consisted primarily of commercial paper  municipal bonds  auction rate securities and notes and institutional money markets 
as a measurement of the sensitivity of our portfolio  if interest rates were to fluctuate by basis points  the impact on total yield would be approximately million 

table of contents auction rate securities risk we face market risk exposure associated with our investments in auction rate securities 
our investments in auction rate securities are classified as trading securities and were recorded at fair value of million at december  the underlying securities related to these investments are student loans  which accounted for of the recorded fair value  and other municipal holdings  which accounted for the remaining million of the recorded fair value 
these ars were intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate approximately every days and allows investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such investments at par 
as a result of current negative conditions in the global credit markets  since february  the large majority of the auctions for our investment in these securities have failed to settle  causing us to continue to hold the securities 
based on the estimated fair value of the ars  during  we recorded an unrealized gain on these securities of approximately million  reflecting the increase in the estimated fair value of these securities
