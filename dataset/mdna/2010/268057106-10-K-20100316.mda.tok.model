this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations  and intentions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to our actual results differing materially from those anticipated include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a

overview business dynamics research corporation  headquartered in andover  massachusetts  is a leading provider of innovative management consulting  engineering  technical and it services and solutions to federal and state governments 
we provide support to our customers in the primary mission areas of it  logistics and readiness  cybersecurity and information assurance  homeland security  health care  and intelligence and space 
as of december   our only reportable business segment was systems and services 
during the fourth quarter of we entered into a plan to sell our metrigraphics division 
as of december   metrigraphics was classified as held for sale and is presented as a discontinued operation 
in the three years ended  we recorded improved operating results absent the effect of the litigation settlement charges recorded in and  which  when included  resulted in a net loss for industry we are cognizant of funding challenges and changing priorities of the federal government 
with the solid growth in the federal it budgets  the growth in the it budget request  and president obama s favorable view of technology  the long term outlook for the federal professional and it services industry is good 
techamerica  a leading trade association in the industry  estimates that the total federal it budget will grow at annually over the next five years  down from the in the prior five years  from billion to billion 
customers have moved away from using gsa schedule contracts in favor of agency wide multiple award id iq multi year contract vehicles 
over the past several years  we have won or acquired many of these contracts including the dhs eagle and pmss management and it services contracts  the military health care teams contract  the air force desp ii engineering services contract  the dod wide lmss logistics services contract  the office of personnel management tma contract  and the alliant government wide contract 
as a result  the overall position of our revenue derived from prime contracts rose to in  up from in in recent years  there has been an increase in the portion of contracts issued on a fixed price basis  compared with time and materials or cost plus  in an effort to reduce the risk to the government of cost overruns 
we believe our contract cost management capabilities are strong and view this trend as favorable to the company 
the amount of our revenue derived from fixed price contracts in was  up from in the federal government also has set high priority and is initiating programs focused on strengthening the government workforce with particular emphasis on personnel responsible for acquisition  such as  acquiring products and services for the government 
the government has set targets for adding to the government workforce with some of these positions coming from a reduction in the number of contractor positions supporting the government  known as in sourcing 
we have experienced a modest reduction in positions and revenue from in sourcing on our business and anticipate continuation of this program 
we also are seeing increasing demand for more human capital and training solutions in support of government initiatives to strengthen the federal workforce 

table of contents outlook our business is conducted primarily with us government customers under both short term and long term contracts 
we have aligned our service offerings to current economic conditions and customer needs 
the us government s budgetary processes give us good visibility regarding future spending and the threat areas that they are addressing 
management believes that our current contracts  and backlog of previously awarded contracts are well aligned with the direction of our customers future needs  and this provides us with good insight regarding future cash flows 
nonetheless  management recognizes that the current economic situation and significant changes in priorities under the new administration likely will result in significant changes in federal spending with increases in some areas and decreases in others 
while we may benefit from the increases  certain programs in which we participate may be subject to reductions 
critical accounting policies there are business risks specific to the industries in which we operate 
these risks include estimates of costs to complete contract obligations  changes in government policies and procedures  government contracting issues and risks associated with technological development 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions also affect the amount of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions and changes in business strategy or market conditions may significantly impact our assets or liabilities  and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant accounting areas particularly those that involve judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we provide services pursuant to time and materials  cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts  including service type contracts 
for time and materials contracts  revenue reflects the number of direct labor hours expended in the performance of a contract multiplied by the contract billing rate  as well as reimbursement of other billable direct costs 
the risk inherent in time and materials contracts is that actual costs may differ materially from negotiated billing rates in the contract  which would directly affect operating income 
for cost reimbursable contracts  revenue is recognized as costs are incurred and includes a proportionate amount of the fee earned 
cost reimbursable contracts specify the contract fee in dollars or as a percentage of estimated costs 
the primary risk on a cost reimbursable contract is that a government audit of direct and indirect costs could result in the disallowance of some costs  which would directly impact revenue and margin on the contract 
historically  such audits have not had a material impact on our revenue and operating income 
revenue from service type fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate output methods to measure service provided  and contract costs are expensed as incurred 
under fixed price contracts  other than service type contracts  revenue is recognized primarily under the percentage of completion method 
the risk on a fixed price contract is estimates of costs to complete the contract may exceed revenues on the contract 
from time to time  we may proceed with work based on client direction prior to the completion and signing of formal contract documents 
we have a formal review process for approving any such work 
revenue associated with such work is recognized only when it can reliably be estimated and realization is probable 
we base our estimates on a variety of factors  including previous experiences with the client  communications with the client regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract 
for all types of contracts  we recognize anticipated contract losses as soon as they become known and estimable 
out of pocket expenses that are reimbursable by the customer are included in revenue and cost of revenue 

table of contents unbilled receivables are the amounts of recoverable revenue that have not been billed at the balance sheet date 
unbilled receivables relate principally to revenue that is billed in the month after services are performed 
in certain instances  billing is deferred in compliance with the contract terms  such as milestone billing arrangements and withholdings  or delayed for other reasons 
costs related to certain us government contracts  including applicable indirect costs  are subject to audit by the government 
revenue from such contracts has been recorded at amounts we expect to realize upon final settlement 
goodwill and other intangible assets with the acquisition of kadix and other businesses in prior years  we acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
the identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition  as well as the completion of annual impairment tests  require significant management judgments and estimates 
these estimates are made based on  among other things  consultations with an accredited independent valuation consultant and reviews of projected cash flows 
we estimate fair value by employing different methodologies  including a comparison to comparable industry companies 
discounted cash flows and market value  applying weighting to these three factors 
the determination of relevant comparable industry companies impacts our assessment of fair value 
should the operating performance of our reporting unit change in comparison to these companies or should the valuation of these companies change  this could impact our assessment of the fair value of the reporting unit 
our discounted cash flow analysis factors in assumptions on revenue and expense growth rates 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity  factoring in customer demand  changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues 
additionally  the discounted cash flow analysis factors in expected amounts of working capital and weighted average cost of capital 
the market value factor is primarily driven by the underlying value of our common stock  which can vary significantly depending upon a number of factors  such as overall market conditions and our estimated future profitability 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the reporting unit 
the company s annual impairment test is based on several qualitative and quantitative factors 
principally  a significant and sustained decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions would increase the risk of impairment of recorded goodwill 
the company operates in the government it consulting marketplace which has historically been characterized by high visibility of future revenue streams  profitability  and generally consistent positive cash flows 
the company s federal government customer base mitigates against near term volatility in financial performance experienced by companies operating in other parts of the economy 
long term industry trends and other business considerations  such as those outlined in the risk factors section of our form k can have a favorable or unfavorable effect on future cash flows 
these trends and business considerations include our concentration of business with the federal government  competitive bidding for contracts  and the mix of contract types in which we enter 
the company considered its low short term volatility  favorable long term industry trends  high visibility for future revenue and cash flow  and stock price as context for the determination that disclosure of heightened risk relative to goodwill impairment was not appropriate at the time of our filing 
as a result of the annual impairment test performed as of december   we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill did not exceed its fair value and  accordingly  did not record a charge for impairment 
however  we are unable to assure that goodwill will not be impaired in subsequent periods 
as of december   we had recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of million in the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes and deferred taxes we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from these positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
we review our tax positions on a quarterly basis and more frequently as facts surrounding tax positions change 
based on these future events  we 
table of contents may recognize uncertain tax positions or reverse current uncertain tax positions which would affect the statement of operations and or the balance sheet 
as part of our process of preparing consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefits from deferred taxes 
this process involves estimating the current tax liability and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
we had a net deferred liability of million at december  compared to a net deferred asset of million at december  we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent a recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
at december   we determined that a valuation allowance was not required 
pension obligations accounting and reporting for our pension plan requires the use of assumptions  including the discount rate and expected rate of return on assets 
these assumptions are used by independent actuaries to determine the value of our pension obligations and allocate this cost to the service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries 
the assumed discount rate  which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled  is determined by a spot rate yield curve method 
the spot rate yield curve is employed to match the plan assets cash outflows with the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments 
as of december   the pension plan s measurement date  the weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligations was and the net periodic benefit costs was 
a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase in annual pension expense by approximately million 
the assumed expected rate of return on plan assets  which is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants  is determined by an annual review of historical long term asset returns and consultation with outside investment advisors 
as of the pension plan s measurement date  the weighted average expected rate of return was 
a decrease of basis points in the expected rate of return would have resulted in an increase in annual pension expense by approximately million 
if assumptions differ materially from actual results in the future  our obligations under the pension plan could also differ materially  potentially requiring us to record an additional pension liability and record additional pension costs 
an actuarial valuation of the pension plan is performed each year 
the results of this actuarial valuation are reflected in the accounting for the pension plan upon determination 
at december   we recorded a pension liability of million in the consolidated balance sheet that represented the underfunded benefit obligation 
litigation  commitments  and contingencies we are subject to a range of claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its internal and external legal counsel 
amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management  after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter  including any settlement offers  has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management  after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter  including any settlement offers  has determined that it is probable that a

the ultimate resolution of any exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
results of operations operating results and results expressed as a percentage of total revenues are as follows year ended december  in millions revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative litigation settlement amortization of intangible assets operating income loss interest expense  net other income  net provision benefit for income taxes loss on discontinued operations net income loss totals may not add due to rounding

revenue we reported revenue of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
revenue increased by million  or in compared to in  revenue increased by million  or compared to the revenue organic growth rate for was 
our computation of organic growth adds kadix s first seven months of revenue in of million to our reported revenues for such period 
also  included million in revenues derived from a contracts received with the kadix acquisition compared with million for absent the effect of the a contracts  the organic growth rate grew to in compared revenues were earned from the following sectors year ended december  in millions national defense and intelligence agencies homeland security federal civilian agencies state and local government agencies other total revenue totals may not add due to rounding 
the decrease in revenues from national defense and intelligence agencies in compared to was due to the roll off of a set aside contracts  lower air force small business set aside revenue under the consolidated acquisition of professional services contract and lower revenue related to the us navy trident missile program 
the decrease in compared to was due to decreased revenues derived from the us air force asc small business set aside consolidated acquisition of professional services contract  the transition from the us air force esc full and open it services program ii contract to the small business set aside professional acquisition support services contract and lower revenue related to the us navy trident missile program 

table of contents our revenues derived from the dod acquisition related advisory and assistance services is currently estimated at million annually 
the federal government has set high priority and is initiating programs focused on strengthening the government workforce  with particular emphasis on personnel responsible for acquiring products and services 
the government has set targets for adding to the government workforce with some of the additions coming from contracted positions  known as in sourcing 
in  twenty of our positions were in sourced 
however  we are unable to predict if the level of this activity will change in and beyond 
the increase in revenues from homeland security and federal civilian agencies in compared to was due to a full year of kadix revenues  supplemented by new contract and task orders received in the second half of and in the increase in both revenue segments in compared to was due to added revenues related to the kadix acquisition and new task orders won in the decrease in revenues from state and local government agencies in compared to was due to lower revenues from the state of ohio contract  which is now completed  partially offset by increased revenues from the new child welfare system development project with the state of tennessee which began in the second quarter of the increase in compared to was primarily due to additional change orders under the state of ohio contract during and revenues from the state of tennessee contract are currently projected at an estimated million for  compared with million for and million for revenues from the state of ohio contract were million in compared with million for revenues by contract type as a percentage of revenues were as follows year ended december  time and materials fixed price  including service type contracts cost reimbursable prime contract sub contract prime revenues increased in compared to and as a result of an increasing portion of contracts awarded under drc s agency wide multiple award schedule id iq contracts  including contracts received through the kadix acquisition 
backlog and booking our backlog position at the end of the three fiscal years was year ended december  in millions backlog funded unfunded total funded bookings for all years funded bookings generated a book to bill ratio of approximately the ending funded backlog as of december   and covered approximately  and months of revenue  respectively 
we expect that substantially all of our funded backlog at december  will generate revenue during the year ending december  the funded backlog generally is subject to possible termination at the convenience of the contracting party 
contracts are generally funded on an annual basis or incrementally for shorter time periods 

table of contents gross profit our gross profit on revenue was million  million and million resulting in a gross margin of in and in both and the increase in gross profit in compared to was primarily due to a full year of business activity associated with kadix revenues 
the improvement in gross margin was due to the addition of higher margin services provided by the acquired kadix operations  improved labor utilization and a shift from subcontract work to prime contract work  partially offset by an increase in pension expense due to the decline in plan asset performance in the increase in gross profit in compared to was attributable to higher revenues primarily related to the kadix acquisition and lower indirect costs  partially offset by costs associated with workforce reductions 
we recorded severance costs of million  million and million in cost of revenue in  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to a full year of kadix selling general and administrative costs and an increase in deferred compensation costs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to the addition of kadix s selling  general and administrative expenses partially offset by continuing cost reduction efforts and lower deferred compensation and stock compensation costs 
litigation settlement during and we recorded a litigation settlement of million and million  respectively 
in august  drc  the department of justice and the united states attorney office  boston  ma  executed a settlement agreement involving drc s admission of liability solely for breach of contract  payment of million to the government and dismissal with prejudice of all other claims against drc 
amortization of intangible assets amortization expense  which relates to the amortization of acquired intangible assets  was million in and million in both and the increase relates to a full year of amortization expense recorded for the acquisition of kadix 
we anticipate amortization expense of million as the impact innovations acquisition related intangible assets became fully amortized in interest expense  net we incurred interest expense totaling million in  million in and million in the increase in interest expense in compared to was due to a full year of interest expense associated with our term loan used to finance the kadix acquisition in the decrease in interest expense in compared to was due to lower daily average borrowings and lower average interest rates on our revolver in  partially offset by interest expense associated with the addition of the million term loan 
we recorded approximately million of interest income in each of the three years ended other income  net other income expense consists of our portion of earnings and losses in hmrtech  gains and losses realized from our deferred compensation plan and results from other non operating transactions  all of which were immaterial to our results 
provision for income taxes we recorded income tax provisions of in and million in and recorded an income tax benefit of million in the effective income tax rate was in compared to and in and  respectively  excluding the tax effect of million in and million in related to the 
table of contents litigation provision 
the effective rate was favorably affected by an adjustment to our unrecognized tax benefits and a reduction in state tax expense associates with the filing of prior year tax returns 
loss on discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of we entered into a plan to sell the metrigraphics division 
as of december   metrigraphics was classified as held for sale as a discontinued operation 
we recorded a loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes of million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
the net book value of the business at december  was million 
we expect the sale of metrigraphics to occur in and currently anticipate a sales price in excess of book value 
shares used in computing earnings loss per share weighted average common shares outstanding and common equivalent shares totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in shares in compared to and the decrease in shares in compared to is due to the net loss recorded in  which did not include the dilutive effect of stock options or unvested restricted stock 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion analyzes liquidity and capital resources by operating  investing and financing activities as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
at december   the borrowing capacity available under our revolver was million 
our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are subject to trends  events and uncertainties  including demands for capital to support growth  economic conditions  government payment practices and contractual matters 
our need for access to funds is dependent on future operating results  our growth and acquisition activity and external conditions 
we have evaluated our future liquidity needs  both from a short term and long term basis 
we believe we have sufficient funds to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the short term 
cash on hand plus cash generated from operations along with cash available under credit lines are expected to be sufficient in to service debt  finance capital expenditures  pay federal and state income taxes and fund the pension plan  if necessary 
to provide for long term liquidity  we believe we can generate substantial positive cash flow  as well as obtain additional capital  if necessary  from the use of subordinated debt or equity 
in the event that our current capital resources are not sufficient to fund requirements  we believe our access to additional capital resources would be sufficient to meet our needs 
we believe that selective acquisitions are an important component of our growth strategy 
we may acquire  from time to time  firms or properties that are aligned with our core capabilities and which complement our customer base 
we will continue to consider acquisition opportunities that align with our strategic objectives  along with the possibility of utilizing the credit facility as a source of financing 
at december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating million and million  respectively 
our operating practice is to apply cash received against any outstanding revolving credit facility balances 
when a revolver balance exists  cash balances at the end of the year generally reflect the timing and size of cash receipts at the end of the year 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of million during was primarily attributable to net earnings realized 
net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations totaled million and million in and  respectively 

table of contents contract receivables were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
billed receivables decreased million and increased million in and  respectively  while unbilled receivables increased million in and million in contract receivables days sales outstanding dso  were days at december  and days at december  federal business dso  which excludes the effect of state contracts  was days at december  and days at december  the states of ohio and tennessee had a combined contract receivable balance outstanding of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
our net deferred tax liability was million at december  compared to a net deferred tax asset of million at december  for a net change of million 
the decrease from the prior year net asset position was primarily due to the current benefit associated with the payment of the litigation reserve and increase in unbilled receivables related to our contract with the state of tennessee 
we paid million in income taxes in compared to million in the decline in the amount paid is due to the benefit to be received for the payment of the litigation reserve in the irs had challenged the deferral of income for tax reporting purposes related to unbilled receivables including the applicability of a letter ruling issued by the irs to drc in january which granted us deferred tax treatment of the unbilled receivables 
this issue was elevated to the irs national office for determination 
on october   we received a notification of ruling from the irs national office 
this ruling provided clarification regarding the irs position relating to revenue recognition for tax purposes regarding our unbilled receivables 
during september  the irs completed its examination of our tax returns for through and issued a revenue agent report  which reduced the deferral of income for tax reporting purposes 
as a result we reclassified approximately million from deferred to current taxes payable 
the irs report also included an assessment of interest of million 
we have filed a protest with the irs to appeal the assessment 
we believe the appeal will be successful and have therefore made no provision for the interest associated with the assessment 
share based compensation decreased to million in from million in and million in the decrease in compared to and compared to was primarily due to the vesting of executive long term incentive program shares in the second quarter of as of december  the total unrecognized compensation related to restricted stock awards was million to be recognized over two years 
non cash amortization expense of our acquired intangible assets was million in and million in both and we anticipate that non cash expense for the amortization of intangible assets will decrease to approximately million in primarily due to intangible assets that were acquired in prior years being fully amortized in our defined benefit pension plan was underfunded by million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the plan s funded status in was primarily attributable to the improvement in the plan asset performance during the year  partially offset by the change in the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations to from in during we recorded pension expense of million compared to pension income of million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in pension expense was primarily due to unfavorable asset performance in we expect to contribute million to fund the pension plan and anticipate pension expense to be approximately million in investing activities net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations of million during was primarily attributable to additional consideration paid in connection with the kadix acquisition and purchases of capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was million in and million in capital expenditures for the purchase of property and equipment were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect discretionary capital expenditures in to be approximately million  of which approximately million will be for expenditures related to the new headquarters facility in the first quarter of 
table of contents on august   we completed the acquisition of kadix 
the total purchase price of million included additional contingent consideration related to achievement of earnout objectives of million that was accrued at december  and paid in during  we made improvements to our headquarters facility of million in connection with our obligation under the sale and leaseback transaction entered into in financing activities during  net cash used in financing activities of million represented repayments under the term loan of million  partially offset by net borrowings of million under our revolver and proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock through the exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions 
at december   the company was in compliance with its loan covenants 
the company s most stringent financial covenant is the fixed charge coverage ratio 
this covenant requires the company to maintain a ratio of adjusted consolidated ebitda to adjusted consolidated interest expense of not less than to 
this fixed charge coverage ratio is tested on a quarterly basis and is measured on a trailing four fiscal quarter basis 
the company believes it has access to additional capital resources  from the use of subordinated debt or equity  as alternate sources of funding 
we are confident that our current resources are sufficient and we believe the possibility of needing additional financing resources is remote 
the average daily borrowing on our revolver for was million at a weighted average interest rate of compared to million at a weighted average interest rate of in and million at a weighted average interest rate of in under our then existing revolver 
during  the average outstanding balance of our term loan was million at a weighted average interest rate of compared to the million outstanding for the last five months of at a weighted average interest rate of 
during  net cash provided by financing activities of million represented net borrowings under the term loan of million and proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock through the exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions  partially offset by net repayments of million under our revolver 
during the third quarter of  we entered into a new unsecured credit facility and an interest rate swap agreement 
the new facility restructured and increased our credit facility to million and provided for a million  five year term loan and a million  five year revolving credit agreement for working capital 
the term loan requires quarterly repayments of million and we expect operating cash flows to be sufficient to fund these repayments 
the swap agreement effectively fixes our interest rate on an initial notional amount of million of the term loan principal at swap fixed rate plus margin throughout the term of the facility 
the facility and swap agreements are more fully described in note and note  respectively  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
during  net cash used in financing activities of million represented net repayments under our credit facility of million  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not utilize or employ any off balance sheet arrangements during the three years ended december   defined as i an obligation under a guarantee contract  ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement  iii an obligation  including a contingent obligation  under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument or iv an obligation  including a contingent obligation  arising out of a variable interest 

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  consist of the following payments due by period less than two to four to one three five in millions total year years years thereafter long term debt payments interest payments operating lease payments total contractual obligation payments contractually obligated operating lease receipts totals may not add due to rounding 
the contractual amounts above related to interest payments does not include the portion of interest contractually due on our term loan principal balance that is not tied to the interest rate swap because those interest rates are not fixed 
during we entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively fixed half of the term loan s principal balance at an interest rate of 
the repayment of borrowings under our revolver of million are contractually due on august  we may be required to make cash outlays related to our unrecognized tax benefits 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  of million as of december  have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information on unrecognized tax benefits  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 
contingencies we are a party to litigation and other proceedings as referenced in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
except as noted therein we do not presently believe it is likely that any of these matters would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our evaluation of the likelihood of expenditures related to these matters is subject to change in future periods  depending on then current events and circumstances  which could have material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements a description of recent accounting pronouncements are referenced in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
impact of inflation and changing prices overall  inflation has not had a material impact on our operations 
additionally  the terms of dod contracts  which accounted for approximately of total revenue in  are generally one year contracts and include salary increase factors for future years  reducing the potential impact of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk associated with our revolver and term loan  where interest payments are tied to either the libor or prime rate 
at december   the interest rate on our revolver and term loan was and  respectively 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate the floating interest rate risk 
table of contents on half of our outstanding term loan 
the swap agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on half of our outstanding term loan at excluding the applicable margin of 
the blended interest rate of our term loan and swap agreement was at december  at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest expense as reported in our consolidated statements of operations 
our potential loss over one year that would result in a hypothetical and instantaneous increase of one full percentage point in the interest rate on half of our term loan would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
in addition  historically our investment positions have been relatively small and short term in nature 
we typically invest excess cash in money market accounts with original maturities of three months or less with no exposure to market interest rates 
we have no significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
foreign sales  which are nominal  are primarily denominated in us dollars
