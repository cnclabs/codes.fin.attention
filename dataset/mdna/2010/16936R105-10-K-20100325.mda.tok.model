inflation and currency matters in the most recent decade  the chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid economic growth as well as relatively high rates of inflation  which in turn has resulted in the periodic adoption by the chinese government of various corrective measures designed to regulate growth and contain inflation 
foreign operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business abroad  including price and currency exchange controls  and fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
during  the company has supplied products to north america and settled in cash in us dollars 
as a result  appreciation or currency fluctuation of the rmb against the us would increase the cost of export products  thus adversely affect the company s financial performance 
in july  the chinese government adjusted its exchange rate policy from fixed rate to floating rate 
during july to july  the exchange rate between rmb and us dollars experienced a big fluctuation  for rmb to us and rmb to us  respectively 
since august  the exchange rate has maintained stable  and was approximately at rmb to us 
there can be no assurance that the exchange rate will remain stable 
the renminbi could appreciate against the us dollar 
the company s financial condition and results of operations may also be affected by changes in the value of certain currencies other than the renminbi in which the company s earnings and obligations are denominated 
in particular  an appreciation of the renminbi is likely to increase the cost of export products  thus decrease the company s cash flow
