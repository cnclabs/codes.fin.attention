item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this annual report 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those we discuss under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a clean energy company providing technologically advanced demand management solutions and load capacity which improve the evolving smart grid 
we provide our solutions to electric utilities  grid operators and associated electricity markets 
as an alternative to the traditional method of providing capacity by building a new power plant  we deliver our solutions through demand management products  services and systems that decrease energy consumption 
our demand management solutions utilize state of the art advancements in hardware  software  and services the solutions are designed  built and operated for the benefit of our customers  which serve residential  commercial and industrial consumers 
we provide capacity to our customers either through long term contracts or through open markets where we actively manage electrical demand or by selling demand management solutions to utilities that operate them 
the capacity we deliver is more environmentally friendly and less expensive than conventional alternatives and has the benefit of increasing overall system reliability 
we provide our clean energy solutions through our three reporting segments the utility products services segment  the residential business segment  and the commercial industrial  or c i  business segment 
the utility products services segment sells solutions comprising hardware  our apollo software and services  such as installation  marketing  it integration and project management  to utilities that elect to own and operate demand management networks for their own benefit 
the residential business segment sells electric capacity to utilities under long term contracts  either through demand response or energy efficiency  primarily through marketing and installing our devices on residential and small commercial end use participants 
the residential business segment also provides marketing services 
the c i business segment provides demand response and energy management services to utilities and associated electricity markets that enable commercial and industrial customers to reduce energy consumption and total costs  improve energy infrastructure reliability and make informed decisions on energy and renewable energy purchases and programs 
as of december   we owned or managed  megawatts  as summarized in the table below 
we include megawatts as owned or managed if there is a contract in place that requires us to either sell capacity to the utility or open market  sell turnkey services or maintenance of a program to a utility  or manage megawatts for a fee 
as of december  commercial utility products residential industrial total services business business comverge megawatts owned under long term capacity contracts megawatts owned for sale in open market programs megawatts owned under turnkey contracts megawatts managed for a fee on a pay for performance basis megawatts owned or managed our vpc contract with nevada energy for megawatts of contracted capacity expired on january  while we are working on extending our relationship with nevada energy  we will remove the megawatts from our contracted capacity amount in the first quarter of if we do not enter into a contractual relationship with nevada energy relating to those megawatts 
does not include megawatts of contracted capacity for virtual peaking capacity  or vpc  contracts that have not received final regulatory approval 
specifically  the table does not include megawatts of contracted capacity for the c i vpc contract with a major virginia based energy provider  which was executed in july as of december   we owned megawatts of contracted capacity from long term contracts 
our existing vpc contracts represented contracted capacity of megawatts and our base load capacity represented contracted capacity of megawatts 
the table below presents the activity in megawatts of contracted capacity from long term capacity contracts 
megawatts owned under long term capacity contracts as of december  new vpc megawatts awarded during the year ended december  nevada energy vpc contract pacific gas electric company vpc contract public service company of new mexico vpc contract expansion of vpc programs total new vpc megawatts awarded expiration of iso new england  inc vpc contracts consolidated edison base load capacity contracts acquired as of december  new vpc megawatts awarded during the year ended december  southern maryland electric cooperative vpc contract expansion of vpc programs total new vpc megawatts awarded new base load capacity program megawatts as of december  new vpc megawatts awarded during the year ended december  arizona vpc program maryland vpc programs awarded southern california vpc program expansion of current vpc program total new vpc megawatts awarded consolidated edison base load capacity contract amendments as of december  our vpc contract with nevada energy for megawatts of contracted capacity expired on january  while we are working on extending our relationship with nevada energy  we will remove the megawatts from our contracted capacity amount in the first quarter of if we do not enter into a contractual relationship with nevada energy relating to those megawatts 
does not include megawatts of contracted capacity for virtual peaking capacity  or vpc  contracts that have not received final regulatory approval 
specifically  the table does not include megawatts of contracted capacity for the c i vpc contract with a major virginia based energy provider  which was executed in july cumulatively  we have installed capacity of megawatts under our long term capacity contracts as of december  compared to megawatts as of december   an increase of megawatts 
the main components of the change are an increase of megawatts from the base load capacity program during the year ended december  and an increase of megawatts installed during the year ended december  in our existing vpc programs 
the table below presents contracted capacity  installed capacity and available capacity as of december  and  respectively 
megawatts december  december  contracted capacity installed capacity available capacity installed capacity generally refers to the number of devices installed multiplied by the historically highest demonstrated available capacity provided per device for the applicable service territory for residential programs 
for commercial and industrial programs  installed capacity generally refers to the megawatts that our end users have committed to shed 
available capacity represents the amount of electric capacity that we have made available to our customers during each contract year based on the results of our measurement and verification process 
we have used the most recently settled measurement and verification results to present available capacity for each period 
for residential vpc programs  available capacity is typically measured during the fourth quarter of each year 
reporting segments we report through three segments the utility products services segment  the residential business segment  and the commercial industrial  or c i  business segment 
the utility products services segment sells solutions comprising hardware  our apollo software and services  such as installation  marketing  it integration and project management  to utilities that elect to own and operate demand management networks for their own benefit 
the residential business segment sells electric capacity to utilities under long term contracts  either through demand response or energy efficiency  primarily through marketing and installing our devices on residential and small commercial end use participants 
the residential business segment also provides marketing services 
the c i business segment provides demand response and energy management services to utilities and associated electricity markets that enable commercial and industrial customers to reduce energy consumption and total costs  improve energy infrastructure reliability and make informed decisions on energy and renewable energy purchases and programs 
utility products services our utility products services segment offers a broad range of products from basic one way load control switches to smart thermostats to comprehensive two way data collection and control systems 
the most widely deployed products offered by our utility products services segment are our digital control unit  an intelligent  microprocessor driven solution for load management control  which is installed on large energy consuming devices and controls the cycling and operation of the device  and our superstat smart thermostat  an advanced  programmable thermostat solution with embedded communications to control air conditioning and heating loads 
our utility products services segment operates turnkey programs in which we design  build out and operate a load control program  with the utility retaining ownership of the underlying asset 
residential business our residential business primarily offers residential vpc programs and our base load energy efficiency programs to electric utilities pursuant to which we provide capacity  on a pay for performance basis  through long term contracts 
under our vpc programs  we develop  operate and manage the entire load management system which is designed to alleviate stress on the system during peak demand 
as of december   we operated five residential and small commercial vpc programs in our residential business segment 
once we secure a vpc contract with a utility customer  our residential business segment incurs significant marketing costs to identify and enroll participants in our vpc programs 
these participant acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
once a participant enrolls in one of our vpc programs  we install a digital control unit or thermostat at the participant s location 
the cost of the installation and the hardware are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining term of the contract with the utility  which is shorter than the operating life of the equipment 
the participant acquisition costs typically result in lower operating margins and greater losses in the early years of a vpc contract 
our base load reduction contracts are similar to the vpc contracts in that we have to recruit and enroll participants into the program 
the participant acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
unlike certain vpc programs  we do not own the underlying asset 
the residential business segment also provides utilities marketing services 
commercial industrial business our commercial industrial business segment offers commercial and industrial demand management and energy management services 
the demand response services provide commercial and industrial consumers with an ability to participate in demand response programs offered in their area by grid operators such as pjm interconnection llc 
the energy management services include the assessment of market opportunities in deregulated and unregulated markets and the performance of energy auditing and implementation strategies 
the energy management services may also include the upgrade and maintenance of power systems such as the implementation of power system distribution analysis  testing  maintenance  replacement or repair  engineering design and consulting  meter and sub meter operations  and data management and analysis 
payments from long term contracts payments from long term contracts represent our estimate of total payments that we expect to receive under long term agreements with our utility customers 
the information presented below with respect to payments from long term contracts includes payments related to our vpc contracts  base load contracts  and open market bidding programs 
as of december   we estimated that our total payments to be received through were approximately million 
we have excluded any estimated payments from our contract with a major virginia based energy provider  as previously announced  which is awaiting final regulatory approval 
these estimates of payments from long term contracts are forward looking statements based on the contractual terms and conditions 
in management s view  such information was prepared on a reasonable basis  reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments  and  to management s knowledge and belief  presents the assumptions and considerations on which we base our belief that we can receive such payments 
however  this information should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results  and readers of this annual report should not place undue reliance on this information 
any differences among these assumptions  other factors and our actual experiences may result in actual payments in future periods significantly differing from management s current estimates of payments allowed under the long term contracts and our actual experiences may result in actual payments collected being significantly lower than current estimates 
see risk factors we may not receive the payments anticipated by our long term contracts and recognize revenues or the anticipated margins from our backlog  and comparisons of period to period estimates are not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of actual payments 
the information in this section is designed to summarize the financial terms of our long term contracts and is not intended to provide guidance on our future operating results  including revenue or profitability 
our estimated payments from long term contracts have been prepared by management based on the following assumptions vpc contracts our existing vpc contracts with regulatory approval as of december  represented contracted capacity of megawatts 
in calculating an estimated million of payments from our vpc contracts as of december   we have included expectations regarding build out based on our experience to date in building out the load management systems as well as future expectations for continuing to enroll participants in each contract s service territory 
in some instances  we may not build out to our contracted capacity due to enrollment rates varying from our expectations 
we have assumed that once our build out phase is completed  we will operate our vpc contracts at the capacity achieved during build out  which generally will be the contracted capacity 
the amount our utility customers pay to us at the end of each contract year may vary based upon the results of measurement and verification tests performed each contract year based on the electric capacity that we made available to the utility during the contract year 
the payments from vpc contracts reflect our most reasonable currently available estimates and judgments regarding the capacity that we believe we will provide our utility customer 
the amount of available capacity we are able to provide  and therefore the amount of payments we receive  is dependent upon the number of participants in our vpc programs 
for purposes of estimating our payments under long term contracts  we have assumed the rate of replacement of participant terminations under our vpc contracts will remain consistent with our historical average 
payments from long term contracts include million that we expect to recognize as revenue over the next year  which we include in backlog 
payments from long term contracts exclude million of payments which we have already received but have been deferred in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
we expect to also recognize these payments as revenue over the course of the next twelve months 
base load capacity contracts our existing energy efficiency contracts as of december  represent potential base load contracted capacity of megawatts 
in calculating the estimated million in payments from these contracts  we have assumed we will complete full build out of the entire remaining megawatts under contract by the end of we have assumed that once our build out is complete  the permanent base load reduction will remain installed and will continue to provide the installed capacity for the remainder of the contract term 
open market bidding programs as of december  we had up to megawatts bid into various capacity open market bidding programs with pjm interconnection  llc 
we currently expect to receive approximately million in long term payments through the year in estimating the long term payments  we have assumed that we will have limited churn among our commercial and industrial participants that we have currently enrolled in the auctions and that we will be able to fulfill incremental capacity in certain programs with new enrollments 
turnkey contracts our turnkey contracts as of december  represent million in payments expected to be received over the next four years with four utility customers to provide products  software  and services  including program management  installation  and or marketing 
this is based on estimated contractual minimum order volumes and current payments attributable to installation and other services applied over the term of the contract 
other contracts an estimated million in payments expected to be received over the next five years pursuant to contracts for our smart grid solutions 
in addition to the foregoing assumptions  our estimated payments from long term contracts assume that we will be able to meet on a timely basis all of our obligations under these contracts and that our customers will not terminate the contracts for convenience or other reasons 
our annual net loss in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
we may continue to generate annual net losses in the future  including through the term of our long term contracts 
see risk factors we have incurred annual net losses since our inception  and we may continue to incur annual net losses in the future 
although we currently intend to release quarterly updates of future revisions that we may make to our estimated payments from long term contracts  we do not undertake any obligation to release the results of any future revisions that we may make to these estimated payments from long term contracts to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this annual report 
backlog our backlog represents our estimate of revenues from commitments  including purchase orders and long term contracts  that we expect to recognize over the course of the next months 
the inaccuracy of any of our estimates and other factors may result in actual results being significantly lower than estimated under our reported backlog 
material delays  market conditions  cancellations or payment defaults could materially affect our financial condition  results of operation and cash flow 
accordingly  a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of actual revenues 
as of december   we had contractual backlog of million through december  results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue the following table summarizes our revenue for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percent change segment revenue utility products services residential business commercial industrial business total program administration services for the tracking and verification of renewable certificates are included in the utility products services segment s results for the year ended december  the services were reported in the commercial industrial business segment in prior years 
accordingly  revenue of million related to these services for the year ended december  has been reclassified 
utility products services revenue our utility products services segment had revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in revenue is due to an increase of million in product sales  primarily attributable to an increase of million in digital control unit revenue and an increase of million in superstat revenue partially offset by a million decrease in other product sales 
digital control unit and superstat shipments to external customers were approximately  units for the year ended december  compared to  units for the year ended december   an increase of 
in addition  service revenue increased by million  mainly due to revenue contributed from the operation of our turnkey programs  which includes such services as installation  marketing and or program management 
residential business revenue our residential business segment had revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
our residential business segment recognized million from our vpc programs  million of revenue from our base load efficiency programs  and million from our marketing and other services during the year ended december  compared to million from our vpc programs  million of revenue from our base load efficiency programs  and million from our marketing and other services during the year ended december  we recognized million of revenue from our vpc contracts in the residential business segment for the year ended december  compared to million of revenue from vpc contracts for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase in vpc contract revenue is due to the increased available capacity provided to our customers as a result of increased build out in the customer s service territory 
our residential business segment s revenue for the year ended december  included million in revenue from our base load energy efficiency programs compared to million in revenue for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the decrease in energy efficiency program revenue is due to a decline in installations partially offset by an increase of million in non recurring revenue benefits due to contractual amendments during the year ended december  compared to the remaining million decrease in our residential business segment s revenue compared to the prior year is due to the non renewal of a marketing contract in we defer revenue and direct cost under our vpc contracts until such revenue can be made fixed and determinable through a measurement and verification test  generally in our fourth quarter 
in the fourth quarters of the years ended december  and  we recognized vpc contract revenue of million and million  respectively 
of the million in vpc deferred revenue as of december   million relates to the contract year and will be recognized during the first half of once the revenue becomes fixed and determinable 
similarly  contract consideration of million was not fixed and determinable as of december  and was recognized in commercial industrial business revenue our commercial industrial business segment had revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
for the year ended december   revenue is comprised of million from demand response services and million from energy management services 
for the year ended december   revenue is comprised of million from demand response services and million from energy management services 
we recognized million from open market programs during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase in revenue is mainly due to the increase in megawatts included in the open market programs as compared to the prior year 
across all c i open market programs in which we participate  we have added megawatts during we recognized million of revenue from our vpc contracts in the commercial industrial business segment for the year ended december  compared to million of revenue from vpc contracts for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase in vpc contract revenue is due to the increased available capacity as a result of additional enrollments of commercial and industrial end users 
the increase in revenue from our open market programs and vpc contracts was partially offset by a decrease of million in energy management revenue is due to the decline in our engineering projects during the year ended december  as a result of the general decline in expenditures by our customer in the current economic environment 
gross profit and margin the following table summarizes our gross profit and gross margin for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  gross gross gross gross profit margin profit margin segment gross profit and margin utility products services residential business commercial industrial business total program administration services for the tracking and verification of renewable certificates are included in the utility products services segment s results for the year ended december  the services were reported in the commercial industrial business segment in prior years 
accordingly  gross profit of million related to these services for the year ended december  has been reclassified 
utility products services gross profit and margin gross profit for our utility products services segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in gross profit is due to an increase in units sold as well as the gross profit contributed from the operation of our turnkey programs 
during the year ended december   we shipped approximately  more digital control units and superstats compared to the year ended december  gross margin decreased by four percentage points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  service sales contributed to the decrease in gross margin for the segment due to the turnkey programs 
residential business gross profit and margin gross profit for our residential business segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
gross profit from our vpc contracts contributed million  our base load efficiency programs contributed million and our marketing and other services contributed the remaining million in gross profit during the year ended december  gross profit included from our vpc contracts  million from our base load efficiency programs and million from our marketing and other services during the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  was compared to a gross margin of for the year ended december   a decrease of percentage points 
the gross margin for our vpc contracts was in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  in our vpc programs  the cost of the hardware and installing that hardware are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining term of the contract with the utility  which is shorter than the operating life of the equipment 
as previously disclosed  our largest vpc contract expired on january  therefore  all capital deployed in under that one vpc contract was fully expensed in resulting in a lower gross margin for that vpc contract and the residential business segment as a whole 
the residential business segment s gross profit for the year ended december  included million in gross profit from our base load energy efficiency programs compared to million in gross profit for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
gross margin attributable to the base load energy efficiency contracts was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the gross profit for and includes non recurring revenue benefits due to contractual amendments of million and million  respectively 
when excluding the non recurring benefits as well as incremental liquidated damages recorded during both years  gross margin decreased by six percentage points for the year ended december  compared to due to the mix of rates we received in certain geographical areas of the manhattan metropolitan area 
the remaining decrease of million in the residential business segment s gross profit compared to the prior year is a result of our marketing and other services provided 
commercial industrial business gross profit and margin gross profit for our commercial industrial business segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
gross profit from our demand response services contributed million and our energy management services contributed million during the year ended december  gross profit from our demand response services contributed million and our energy management services contributed million during the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  was compared to gross margin of for the year ended december   due to the higher margin realized in the pjm capacity demand response program 
operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percent change operating expenses general and administrative expenses marketing and selling expenses research and development expenses amortization of intangible assets impairment charges total not meaningful 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is attributable to million of non recurring charges recorded during comprised of million in stock based compensation related to the acceleration of equity awards and million in retirement and consulting payments pursuant to the retirement agreement of mr 
robert m 
chiste  our former chairman of the board of directors  president and chief executive officer  and million in stock based compensation related to the acceleration of non executive stock options with a strike price of or higher 
net of these non recurring charges  general and administrative expenses decreased by million mainly due to cost containment and reduction measures implemented during marketing and selling expenses marketing and selling expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
we recorded million in stock based compensation related to the acceleration of non executive stock options with a strike price of or higher  which was partially offset by a decrease in other stock based compensation  excluding the acceleration  of million 
the remaining increase in marketing and selling expenses was comprised of a million increase in commission expense and a million increase in marketing and advertising partially offset by a million decrease in consulting expense 
we expense customer acquisition costs as incurred 
vpc customer acquisition costs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of million 
as a result of a recent review of our sales and marketing efforts  we plan to improve our sales and marketing structure by increasing our sales force with solutions experienced professionals over the next twelve months 
we expect the increase in our sales force will increase marketing and selling expenses by approximately million 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are incurred primarily in connection with the identification  testing and development of new products and software  specifically the development of products to support utility advanced metering infrastructure  or ami 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in research and development expenses is mainly due to an increase and re deployment in headcount and an increase in contractors to develop new ami enabled hardware products and our apollo software 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in amortization expense is due to the decrease in finite lived intangible assets as a result of our impairment assessment during partially offset by the amortization of non compete agreements 
in addition to the amortization presented in operating expenses  we also recorded million in amortization expense for the year ended december  in our cost of revenue compared to million for the year ended december  impairment charges we performed our annual impairment test as of december  and the results of the test indicated no impairment 
other than our annual impairment test  no other impairment tests during the year were necessary as no events or changes in circumstances occurred during see results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  for a complete discussion of the impairment charges recorded for the year ended december  interest expense  net we recorded net interest expense of million for year ended december  compared to net interest expense of  for the year ended december  the increase of million in net interest expense during each period was mainly a result of less investment income and increased interest expense as a result of our outstanding debt facilities as well as a million charge recorded to interest expense to write off unamortized debt issuance costs related to our termination of the general electric capital corporation credit agreement 
other income  net net other income decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to net other income of million for the year ended december  in the year ended december   we recorded a million gain on extinguishment of debt as a result of our prepayment to certain note holders at a discount of their then outstanding balance 
no such gain was recorded in the year ended december  income taxes a provision of million was recorded during the year ended december  related to a deferred tax liability 
a tax benefit of million was recorded during the year ended december  as a result of the million trade name intangible asset impairment  the related deferred tax liability of million was removed from the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december   and is reflected as a tax benefit in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  we provided a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets because the realization of any future tax benefits could not be sufficiently assured as of december  and year ended december  compared to year ended december  the results of operations for the year ended december  will not be comparable to the results of operations for the year ended december  due to the enerwise and pes acquisitions completed in the second half of the year ended december  includes results from the date of acquisitions to the end of the year 
the year ended december  includes a full year of operating results for the consolidated company  including the acquired entities 
revenue the following table summarizes our revenue for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percent change segment revenue utility products services residential business commercial industrial business total program administration services for the tracking and verification of renewable certificates are included in the utility products services segment s results for the year ended december  the services were reported in the commercial industrial business segment in prior years 
accordingly  revenue of million and million  respectively  related to these services for the years ended december  and has been reclassified 
utility products services revenue our utility products services segment had revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in revenue is due to a million increase in digital control unit revenue and a million increase in superstat revenue 
digital control unit and superstat shipments to external customers were approximately  units for the year ended december  compared to  units for the year ended december   an increase of 
the remaining increase of million is due to service revenue 
residential business revenue our residential business segment had revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
we recognized million of revenue from our vpc contracts  million from our base load energy efficiency programs and million from our marketing and other services during the year ended december  we recognized million of revenue from our vpc contracts  million from our base load energy efficiency programs and million from our marketing and other during the year ended december  we recognized million of revenue from our vpc contracts in the residential business segment for the year ended december  compared to million of revenue from vpc contracts for the year ended december   a million decrease 
during the year ended december   our vpc contract with iso new england  inc expired according to its terms  which previously provided million of revenue in the year ended december  in  the residential business segment partially offset the lost revenue from the iso new england  inc contract by continuing to expand build out in our remaining and new vpc programs 
our residential business segment s revenue for the year ended december  included million in revenue from our base load energy efficiency programs compared to million in revenue for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the base load energy efficiency contracts were acquired as part of the public energy solutions  or pes  acquisition in september the operating results were included in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the date of acquisition 
the remaining million increase in our residential business segment s revenue compared to the prior year is a result of our marketing and other services 
specifically  a portion of assets from our now expired iso new england inc vpc contract has been deployed in the independent system operator forward capacity market 
we recognized million in revenue during the year ended december  from managing these megawatts 
we defer revenue and direct cost under our vpc contracts until such revenue can be made fixed and determinable through a measurement and verification test  generally in our fourth fiscal quarter 
for the fourth quarters ended december  and  we recognized vpc contract revenue of million and million  respectively 
because contract year consideration of million related to our vpc contracts was not fixed and determinable as of december   this amount will be recognized as revenue during similarly  contract year consideration of million was not fixed and determinable as of december  and was recognized as revenue in the first half of commercial industrial business revenue our commercial industrial business segment was essentially formed with our acquisition of enerwise global technologies  inc  or enerwise  in july during the year ended december  and  the commercial industrial business segment had revenue of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   revenue is comprised of million from demand response services and million from energy management services 
for the year ended december   revenue is comprised of million from demand response services and million from energy management services 
revenue from economic demand response programs was million in the year ended december  the current year economic program revenue was significantly less than revenue for the prior year 
in the prior year  economic demand response program revenue was million from the date we acquired enerwise on july  to december  the decrease in demand response service revenue is directly related to the pjm rule change effected in that reduced the price we receive under our economic or voluntary demand response programs for commercial and industrial consumers 
because such programs are voluntary  the lower price and operating rule changes in made it less compelling for our commercial and industrial consumers to participate 
the majority of managed megawatts are enrolled in economic demand response programs  which are weather dependent 
warmer temperatures generally result in higher electricity prices in the pjm service territory 
these higher prices tend to make it economically attractive for our commercial and industrial consumers to shed load which we then sell to pjm 
the rule changes to these programs in had the effect of reducing the spot market price by the average retail rate paid by the commercial and industrial customer  resulting in a lower price received by us  and ultimately the end consumer 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue for the commercial industrial business segment s capacity demand response programs 
in the prior year  capacity demand response program revenue was million from the date we acquired enerwise on july  to december  the million in revenue during was comprised of revenue for two capacity years one capacity year beginning june  and ending may  and one capacity year beginning june  and ending may  of the million in capacity revenue recognized for the year ended december   million related to the capacity year ending may  and the remaining million related to the capacity year beginning june  and ending may  during the capacity year ended may   we recognized revenue as monthly payments were received over the course of the full contract year 
following a clarification of the program rules by pjm  we revised the attribution period for revenue related to the capacity program 
based on this clarification  revenue is recognized when it becomes fixed and determinable at the end of the mandatory performance period 
for the capacity year ending may   we recognized revenue at the end of the september as we had completed the mandatory performance period during the months of june to september 
gross profit and margin the following table summarizes our gross profit and gross margin percentages for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  gross gross gross gross profit margin profit margin segment gross profit and margin utility products services residential business commercial industrial business total program administration services for the tracking and verification of renewable certificates are included in the utility products services segment s results for the year ended december  the services were reported in the commercial industrial business segment in prior years 
accordingly  gross profit of million and million  respectively  related to these services for the years ended december  and has been reclassified 
utility products services gross profit and margin gross profit for our utility products services segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
an increased gross profit resulted from the increase in revenue 
specifically  we shipped  more digital control units and superstats to external customers in as compared to residential business gross profit and margin gross profit for our residential business segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the gross margin for vpc contracts was in the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the gross margin of our vpc contracts varies due to the period in which we depreciate our vpc program capital equipment 
we depreciate our vpc program capital equipment over the remaining contract life  which is shorter than the economic life of such equipment 
as a result  the annual depreciation charge per new kilowatt of capacity installed will increase over the term of a vpc contract  while the revenue per kilowatt of capacity for any contract year will be determined by other factors that bear no relation to the depreciation 
the residential business segment s gross profit for the year ended december  included million in gross profit from our base load energy efficiency programs compared to million in gross profit for the year ended december   an increase of million 
gross margin attributable to the base load energy efficiency contracts was approximately for both years ended december  and the remaining million increase in residential business segment s gross profit compared to the prior year is a result of our marketing and other services

research and development expenses research and development expenses are incurred primarily in connection with the identification  testing and development of new products and software  specifically the development of products to support utility advanced metering infrastructure 
research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to the definite lived intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisitions of enerwise and pes during the second half of impairment charges in the commercial industrial business segment  a rule change for economic demand response programs in the pjm market during the third quarter of caused a decline in the projected operating results for the remainder of and future periods 
based on the reduction of projected operating results in current and future periods  we determined that an interim impairment test of goodwill was required 
the valuation for the goodwill was performed using a discounted cash flow income approach to valuing the business using a discount rate 
the valuation resulted in a non cash impairment of goodwill related to the commercial industrial business segment of million to reflect the carrying value in excess of the fair value 
as a part of the reorganization announced on september   we made the decision to no longer use the enerwise trade name 
accordingly  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge related to the enerwise trade name 
contemporaneous with our interim goodwill impairment test  we also performed an analysis of the potential impairment and reassessed other identified intangible assets within the commercial industrial business segment 
the impairment analysis for the customer relationships was performed using an excess earnings income approach to valuing the asset using a discount rate 
as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value to the calculated fair value 
total noncash impairment charges for the year ended december  were million 
for the year ended december   the impairment charge  net of tax benefit  per share  was 
there were no such impairment charges in the year ended december  interest expense  net net interest expense increased to  for the year ended december  from million of interest income for the year ended december  the increase in expense was mainly due to the interest expense related to the subordinated convertible promissory notes issued in connection with our acquisitions in the second half of other income  net net other income increased to million for the year ended december  from an expense of million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the million gain on extinguishment of debt that we recorded as a result of our prepayment to certain note holders at a discount of their then outstanding balance 
income taxes a tax benefit of million was recorded for the year ended december   compared to tax expense of million for the year ended december  the decrease in the provision for income taxes is primarily due to the enerwise trade name impairment during  which resulted in the removal of the related deferred tax liability from our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we provided a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets because the realization of any future tax benefits could not be sufficiently assured as of december  or liquidity and capital resources overview prior to our initial public offering in april  we funded our operations primarily through the issuance of an aggregate of million in preferred stock  million in subordinated convertible debt and borrowings under our then senior loan agreement and general electric capital corporation credit facility 
we used these proceeds to fund our operations and to invest in our vpc programs  both in the form of capital expenditures to build out the capacity under our vpc contracts and participant acquisition expenses such as advertising and participant incentive payments  which were expensed as incurred

the notes bore interest at a rate of per annum and matured on april  interest payments on the notes were made quarterly 
the notes were convertible into shares of common stock at the option of the holders thereof beginning one year from the date issued at a price per share of which represents of the average closing price of our common stock for the trading days immediately prior to the execution of the enerwise purchase agreement

capital spending as of december   our vpc programs had estimated installed capacity of megawatts 
our existing vpc contracts as of december  provided for a potential capacity of megawatts 
our residential vpc programs require a significant amount of capital spending to build out our demand response networks 
we expect to incur approximately million in capital expenditures  primarily over the next three years  to continue building out our existing vpc programs  of which million is anticipated to be incurred through december  if we are successful in being awarded additional vpc contracts  we would incur additional amounts to build out these new vpc programs 
non gaap financial measures earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  is defined as net loss before net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  and depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is a non gaap financial measure and is not a substitute for other gaap financial measures such as net loss  operating loss or cash flows from operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap 
in addition  our calculation of ebitda may or may not be consistent with that of other companies 
we urge you to review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report and our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the other financial information contained in this annual report  and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
ebitda is a common alternative measure of performance used by investors  financial analysts and rating agencies to assess operating performance for companies in our industry 
depreciation is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenue 
we do not believe that this expense is indicative of our core operating performance because the depreciable lives of assets vary greatly depending on the maturity terms of our vpc contracts 
the clean energy sector has experienced recent trends of increased growth and new company development  which have led to significant variations among companies with respect to capital structures and cost of capital which affect interest expense 
management views interest expense as a by product of capital structure decisions and  therefore  it is not indicative of our core operating performance 
our internal budgets are based on ebitda  and we use ebitda as one of several criteria to determine performance based cash compensation 
we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda before stock based compensation expense and impairment charges 
management does not believe that stock based compensation is indicative of our core operating performance because the stock based compensation is the result of restricted stock and stock option grants which require a noncash expense to be recorded in the financial statements 
management believes the impairment charges related to the enerwise reporting unit to be not indicative of our core operating performance 
a reconciliation of net loss  the most directly comparable gaap measure  to ebitda and adjusted ebitda for each of the fiscal periods indicated is as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  net loss depreciation and amortization interest expense income  net provision benefit for income taxes ebitda non cash stock compensation expense non cash impairment charge adjusted ebitda commitments and contingencies in the ordinary conduct of our business  we are subject to periodic lawsuits  investigations and claims 
although we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of lawsuits  investigations and claims asserted against us  we do not believe that any currently pending legal proceeding or proceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is subject will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
our policy is to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters  as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the liability required  if any  for these contingencies is made after an analysis of each known issue 
a liability is recorded and charged to operating expense when we determine that a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
additionally  we disclose contingencies for which a material loss is reasonably possible  but not probable 
as of december   there were no material contingencies requiring accrual or disclosure 
as previously disclosed in our quarterly report on form q for the period ended march   in january  ip co 
llc  d b a intus iq  filed a complaint in the us district court for the eastern district of texas against comverge  inc  oncor electric delivery company llc  reliant energy  inc  datamatic  ltd  eka systems  inc  sensus metering systems inc  tantalus systems corp  tendril networks  inc  trilliant incorporated  and trilliant networks  inc  alleging infringement of two patents owned by ip co 
llc 
the complaint alleged that the us patents  concerning wireless mesh networking systems  are being infringed by the defendants 
comverge and intus iq settled the litigation on july  and the complaint has been dismissed with prejudice 
the settlement did not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
contractual obligations information regarding our known contractual obligations of the types described below as of december  is set forth in the following table dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years bank debt obligations cash interest payments on debt operating lease obligations severance retirement obligations total licensing agreement as part of our contractual obligations under an exclusive licensing agreement for certain product technology  we have the option to maintain licensing exclusivity on an annual basis by making payments ranging from million to million over the next two years 
we are also obligated to pay royalties to the licensor for each unit sold that incorporates the licensed technology 
such royalties are reduced by the amount of optional exclusivity payments described above 
these payments have been excluded from the table above 
guarantees we typically grant customers a limited warranty that guarantees that our products will substantially conform to current specifications for days related to software products and one year related to hardware products from the delivery date 
we also indemnify our customers from third party claims relating to the intended use of our products 
standard software license agreements contain indemnification clauses 
pursuant to these clauses  we indemnify and agree to pay any judgment or settlement relating to a claim 
there were no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  and we have guaranteed the electrical capacity we have committed to deliver pursuant to certain long term contracts 
such guarantees may be secured by cash  letters of credit  performance bonds or third party guarantees 
performance guarantees during the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and our related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we re evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
a summary of our critical accounting policies is set forth below 
revenue recognition utility products services we sell hardware products and services directly to utilities for use and deployment by the utility 
we recognize revenue for such sales when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered and the following criteria have been met delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  collection is probable  and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we have certain contracts which are multiple element arrangements and provide for several deliverables to the customer that may include installation services  marketing services  program management services  right to use software  hardware and hosting services 
these contracts require no significant production  modification or customization of the software and the software is incidental to the products and services as a whole 
we evaluate each deliverable to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting 
if objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for all units of accounting in the arrangement  revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on relative fair values 
each unit of accounting is then accounted for under the applicable revenue recognition guidance 
in situations in which there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all undelivered elements but not for delivered elements  the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement s consideration 
revenue recognition residential business we defer revenue and the associated cost of revenue related to certain long term vpc contracts until such time as the annual contract payment is fixed and determinable 
we invoice vpc customers on a monthly or quarterly basis throughout the contract year 
the vpc contracts require us to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility customers  and require a measurement and verification of such capacity on an annual basis in order to determine final contract consideration for a given contract year 
contract years typically begin at the end of a control season generally  at the end of a utility s summer cooling season that correlates to the end of the utility s peak demand for electricity and continue for twelve months thereafter 
once we secure a vpc contract with a utility customer  our residential business segment incurs significant marketing costs to identify and enroll participants in our vpc programs 
these participant acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
once a participant enrolls in one of our vpc programs  we install a digital control unit or thermostat at the participant s location 
the cost of the installation and the hardware are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining term of the contract with the utility  which is shorter than the operating life of the equipment 
the depreciation is recognized contemporaneously with revenue 
we enter into agreements to provide base load capacity 
base load capacity revenues are earned based on our ability to achieve committed capacity through load reduction 
in order to provide capacity  we deliver and install demand side management measures 
the base load capacity contracts require us to provide electric capacity to utility customers  and include a measurement and verification of such capacity in order to determine contract consideration 
we defer revenue and associated cost of revenue in our electric load reduction services until such time as the capacity amount  and therefore the related revenue  is fixed and determinable 
once the capacity amount has been verified  the revenue is recognized 
if the revenue is subject to penalty  refund or an ongoing obligation  the revenue is deferred until the contingency is resolved and or we have met our performance obligation 
certain contracts contain multiple deliverables  or elements  which require us to assess whether the different elements qualify for separate accounting 
the separate deliverables in these arrangements meet the separation criteria 
accordingly  revenue is recognized for each element by applying the residual method  since there is objective evidence of fair value of only the undelivered item 
the amount allocated to the delivered item is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of the additional element 
revenue recognition commercial industrial business we enter into agreements to provide demand response services 
the demand response programs require us to provide electric capacity through demand reduction to utility end customers when the utility or independent system operator calls a demand response event to curtail electrical usage 
demand response revenues are earned based on our ability to deliver capacity 
in order to provide capacity  we manage a portfolio of commercial and industrial end users electric loads 
capacity amounts are verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a customer initiated demand response test 
we recognize revenue and associated cost of revenue in its demand response services at such time as the capacity amount is fixed and determinable 
we record revenue from capacity programs with independent system operators 
the capacity year for our primary capacity program spans from june st to may st annually 
for participation  we receive cash payments on a monthly basis in the capacity year 
participation in the capacity program requires us to respond to requests from the system operator to curtail energy usage during the mandatory performance period of june through september  which is the peak demand season 
the annual payments for a capacity year are recognized at the end of the mandatory performance period  once the revenue is fixed and determinable 
revenue from time and materials service contracts and other services are recognized as services are provided 
revenue from certain fixed price contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis  which involves the use of estimates 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure the progress towards completion  revenue is recognized when the project is completed or when final acceptance is received from the customer 
we also enter into agreements to provide hosting services that allow customers to monitor and analyze their electrical usage 
revenue from hosting contracts is recognized as the services are provided  generally on a recurring monthly basis 
revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
goodwill and intangibles  net goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identified intangible assets of businesses acquired in purchase transactions 
goodwill is not being amortized 
intangibles are recorded at their fair value at acquisition date 
we amortize finite lived intangibles over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method  which approximates the projected utility of such assets based upon the information available 
we currently amortize acquired intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from three to fourteen years 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis  on december of each year  as well as on an as needed basis determined by events or changes in circumstances 
an impairment test of goodwill and certain intangible assets was performed during the third quarter of the interim impairment assessment was triggered by a rule change in a certain market effected in that reduced the price we receive under our economic  or voluntary  demand response programs for commercial and industrial consumers in the pjm service territory 
based on this evaluation  we recorded a non cash impairment charge 
see results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  for a complete discussion on the methodology and assumptions applied 
we performed our annual impairment test as of december st and the results of the tests performed on december   and indicated no additional impairment 
goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
goodwill was tested for impairment using the two step approach 
step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not required 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be assessed by comparing their carrying value to the undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows expected to be derived from such assets 
if such evaluation indicates a potential impairment  a discounted cash flow analysis is used to measure fair value in determining the amount of these assets that should be written off 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense recognized for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively  before income taxes 
for awards with service conditions and graded vesting  a one time election was made to recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
for options with performance and or service conditions only  we utilized the black scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value of options issued 
for restricted stock awards with service conditions  we utilized the intrinsic value method 
for awards with market conditions  we utilized a lattice model to estimate the award fair value and the derived service period 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the risk free interest rate  volatility  annual forfeiture rate  and expected term 
performance based unvested awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company or personal performance goals 
if any of these assumptions differ significantly from actual  stock based compensation expense could be impacted 
we will recognize million of additional expense related to unvested awards as of december  over a weighted average period of years 
on november   our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of  time based stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than for certain of its employees 
restricted stock  stock options with vesting based on performance  and stock options held by executive officers and directors were not accelerated 
as a result of the acceleration  an aggregate of  unvested stock options with exercise prices ranging from to became immediately exercisable 
the weighted average exercise price of the options that were accelerated was approximately 
the accelerated options would have vested from time to time through february  all other terms and conditions applicable to the accelerated stock option grants  including the exercise price  number of shares  and term  remain unchanged 
the incremental noncash stock based compensation expense recognized in the fourth quarter of as a result of the acceleration was million
