item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyright  patent and trademark laws and on contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our technologies and fonts 
whenever possible  we enter into non disclosure agreements with our suppliers  partners and others to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
we apply for us and international patents with respect to our technologies and seek copyright registration of our software and us and international trademark registration in those instances in which we determine that it is competitively advantageous and cost effective to do so 
we have been granted a total of eight patents and have six patents pending with the us patent and trademark office 
our most important patents are related to our microtype font compression technology  subpixel rendering technology and act technology 
we have unregistered trademarks and registered trademarks  where appropriate  on the key fonts in our font libraries 
we intend to continue our policy of taking all measures we deem necessary to protect our patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark rights 
some of our fonts are owned by third parties that we license under exclusive and non exclusive agreements 
we have also collaborated with third parties in the production and development of fonts 
competition our text imaging solutions compete with those offered by a variety of companies  including vendors of laser printer and display imaging technologies and printer drivers and providers of fonts 
we compete principally on the basis of our technical innovation  engineering and customer support expertise  the breadth of our font offerings and the overall performance of our text imaging solutions  including reliability and timely delivery 
competition with our solutions principally comes from adobe and bitstream  inc  or bitstream  but we also compete with local providers of text imaging solutions that offer solutions specific to a particular country s language requirements 
we also compete with freetype  an open source collaborative organization that provides its linux font rendering code for free  with printer driver provider software imaging and with extensis and insider software with respect to our fontexplorerx product 
the competition for our fonts and custom font design services generally comes from companies offering their own typeface libraries and custom typeface services  including bitstream  adobe  ascender corporation  or ascender  font foundry websites  font related websites and independent professionals 
we also compete with in house resources of our oem customers 

table of contents employees and consultants at december   we employed persons 
in addition  we have an exclusive relationship with a consulting firm that provides font design and production services in china 
the table below provides our employees by functional area 
number of employees percentage sales and marketing research and development general and administration total none of our employees or consultants are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
our linotype employees are represented by a work council 
this work council has the right to participate in certain decisions by linotype  including operational changes  such as relocation of the business or change of control transactions  and social matters  such as wages and salaries and working hours 
we believe that our relations with our employees and consultants are good 
segment information information concerning revenue from our two principal markets for the last three years may be found in note to our consolidated financial statements

risk factors set forth below are certain risk factors that could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
you should carefully read the following risk factors  together with the financial statements  related notes and other information contained in this annual report on form k 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that contain risks and uncertainties 
please refer to the discussion of forward looking statements on page two of this annual report on form k in connection with your consideration of the risk factors and other important factors that may affect future results described below 

table of contents risks related to our business a prolonged economic downturn could materially harm our business 
our ability to generate revenue is affected by the level of business activity of our oem and creative professional customers  which  in most cases  is affected by the level of economic activity occurring in the industries and markets that our customers serve 
negative trends in the general economy  including trends resulting from a recession  the availability of credit  actual or threatened military action by the united states  terrorist attacks on the united states or abroad or increased oil prices  could cause a decrease in consumer and or business spending on computer hardware and software and ce devices in general and could negatively affect the rate of growth of ce device markets or of adoption of ce devices 
any economic downturn  including a reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general  could also adversely affect the demand for fonts or impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services that they have purchased 
with the general economic slowdown that the worldwide economy has experienced recently  we have seen a decrease in the demand for ce devices  including laser printers  which in turn  has decreased the demand for our font technologies 
with respect to our creative professional business  we have also  for example  seen a reduction in font purchases by our publishing customers who have been impacted by overall economic conditions 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery and this uncertainty makes it difficult to determine if past experience is a good guide to the future 
if the downturn in the general economy or markets in which we operate persists or worsens from present levels  the demand for fonts and font technologies could continue to decline and our revenue and profitability could be materially and adversely impacted 
we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from a limited number of licensees  and if we are unable to maintain these customer relationships or attract additional customers  our revenue will be adversely affected 
we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from the licensing of our text imaging solutions to oems 
for the years ended december   and  our top ten licensees by revenue accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue  respectively 
accordingly  if we are unable to maintain these relationships or establish relationships with new customers  our licensing revenue will be adversely affected 
in addition  some of our license agreements are for a limited period of time and  upon expiration of their license agreements  these oems may not renew their agreements or may elect not to enter into new agreements with us on terms as favorable as our current agreements 
we face pressure from our customers to lower our license fees and  to the extent we lower them in the future  our revenue may be adversely affected 
the ce device markets are highly competitive and ce device manufacturers are continually looking for ways to reduce the costs of components included in their products in order to maintain or broaden consumer acceptance of those products 
because our technologies are a component incorporated into ce devices  when negotiating renewals of customer contracts  we face pressure from our customers to lower our license fees 
we have in the past  and may in the future  need to lower our license fees  either immediately or over time  to preserve customer relationships or extend use of our technology to a broader range of products 
to the extent contractual license fees for any particular customer are lower in the future  we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve related increases in the use of our technologies or other benefits to fully offset the effects of these adjustments 
if we fail to develop and deliver innovative text imaging solutions in response to changes in our industry  including changes in consumer tastes or trends  our revenue could decline 
the markets for our text imaging solutions are characterized by rapid change and technological evolution and are intensely competitive and price sensitive 
we will need to expend considerable 
table of contents resources on product development in the future to continue to design and deliver enduring and innovative text imaging solutions 
we rely on the introduction of new or expanded solutions with additional or enhanced features and functionality to allow us to maintain our royalty rates in the face of downward pressure on our royalties resulting from efforts by ce device manufacturers to reduce costs 
despite our efforts  we may not be able to develop and effectively market new text imaging solutions that adequately or competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace 
in addition  we may not correctly identify new or changing market trends at an early enough stage to capitalize on market opportunities 
our future success depends  to a great extent  on our ability to develop and deliver innovative text imaging solutions that are widely adopted in response to changes in our industry  that are compatible with the solutions introduced by other participants in our industry and for which the ce device manufacturers are willing to pay competitive royalties 
our failure to deliver innovative text imaging solutions that allow us to stay competitive and for which we can maintain our royalty rates would adversely affect our revenue 
if hewlett packard or adobe were to discontinue their use of our text imaging solutions in their products  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
because of their market position as industry leaders  the incorporation by hp of our text imaging solutions in its laser printers and the incorporation of our text imaging solutions by adobe in its postscript product promote widespread adoption of our technologies by manufacturers seeking to maintain compatibility with hp and adobe 
if hp or adobe were to stop using our text imaging solutions in their products  the market acceptance of our technologies by other ce device manufacturers would be materially and adversely affected  and this would in turn adversely affect our revenue 
if we are unable to further penetrate our existing markets or adapt or develop text imaging solutions  our business prospects could be limited 
we expect that our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to successfully penetrate existing markets for ce devices  including laser printers  digital copiers  mobile phones  digital televisions  set top boxes  navigation devices and digital cameras 
to date  we have penetrated only some of these markets 
our ability to grow our revenue depends upon our ability to further penetrate these markets and to successfully penetrate those markets in which we currently have no presence 
demand for our text imaging solutions in any of these developing markets may not develop or grow  and a sufficiently broad base of oems may not adopt or continue to use products that employ our text imaging solutions 
because of our limited experience in some of these markets  we may not be able to adequately adapt our business and our solutions to the needs of these customers 
in addition  traditionally we have licensed our technologies and fonts to oems that embed our technology on their platforms 
software licensing models are evolving and if we are not able to make our fonts and font technologies available under these models  our business prospects could suffer 
new licensing and business models are evolving in the software industry 
for example  a company may provide software applications  data and related services over the internet  using primarily advertising or subscription based revenue models sometimes known as cloud computing 
recent advances in computing and communications technologies  and specifically a growth in the demand for web based fonts that integrate seamlessly with all web browsers and operating systems  have made this model viable 
as software licensing models evolve  we may not be successful in adapting to these new business models and our business prospects could suffer 
open source software may make us more vulnerable to competition because new market entrants and existing competitors could introduce similar products quickly and cheaply 
open source refers to the free sharing of software code used to build applications in the software development community 
individual programmers may modify and create derivative works and distribute 
table of contents them at no cost to the end user 
to the extent that open source software that has the same or similar functionality as our technologies is developed or gains market share  demand for our text imaging solutions may decline  we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our text imaging solutions and our results of operations may be negatively affected 
the rate of growth of the market for ce devices is uncertain 
our success depends in large part upon the ability of ce device manufacturers who license our text imaging solutions to successfully market and sell their products 
continued growth in the adoption of ce devices like mobile phones and technological improvements in wireless devices  such as increases in functional memory  are critical to our future growth 
if ce device manufacturers do not continue to successfully develop and market new products and services incorporating our text imaging solutions  or the products that our customers develop and market do not meet market acceptance  our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected 
the market for text imaging solutions for laser printers is a mature market growing at a slower rate than other markets in which we operate 
to the extent that sales of laser printers level off or decline  our licensing revenue may be adversely affected 
a significant portion of our revenue in  and was derived from laser printer manufacturers 
the laser printer market is a mature market and as a result  it has grown at a slower rate than other markets in which we operate 
in  the laser printer market experienced a decline and our revenue was adversely affected 
if sales of printers incorporating our text imaging solutions level off  or decline  then our licensing revenue may be adversely affected 
our operating results may fluctuate based upon an increase or decrease of market share by ce device manufacturers to whom we license our text imaging solutions 
the terms of our license agreements with our ce device manufacturers vary 
for example  we have fixed fee licensing agreements with certain customers  some of which may decline over time 
if these customers  some of whom are instrumental in setting industry standards and influencing early adoption of technology incorporating our text imaging solutions  were to increase their share of the ce device market  under the terms of these agreements there would not be a corresponding increase in our revenue 
any change in the market share of ce device manufacturers to whom we license our text imaging solutions is entirely outside of our control 
the success of our business is influenced by the interoperability of our text imaging solutions with a variety of ce devices and software applications and operating systems 
to be successful we must design our text imaging solutions to interoperate effectively with a variety of ce devices 
we depend on the cooperation of ce device manufacturers with respect to the components integrated into their devices  such as page description languages  or pdls  as well as software developers that create the operating systems and applications  to incorporate our solutions into their product offerings 
if manufacturers of ce devices elect not to incorporate our solutions into their product offerings  our revenue potential would be adversely affected 
our success depends on the existence of a market for products that incorporate our text imaging solutions 
our future success will depend on market demand for text imaging solutions that enable ce devices to render high quality text 
this market is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and needs  and frequent new product introductions 
if the need for laser printers and other ce devices utilizing our technology were to decrease or if current models of these products were replaced by 
table of contents new or existing products for which we do not have a competitive solution or if our solutions are replaced by others that become the industry standard  our customers may not purchase our solutions and our revenue would be adversely affected 
for example  if graphical device interface  or gdi  printers became the industry standard replacing pdl printers  our revenue would be adversely affected 
we face significant competition in various markets  and if we are unable to compete successfully  our ability to generate revenue from our business could suffer 
we face significant competition in the text imaging solutions markets 
we believe that our most significant competitive threat comes from companies that compete with some of our specific offerings 
those competitors currently include adobe  bitstream  ascender  software imaging  extensis  insider software  freetype  and local providers of text imaging solutions whose products are specific to a particular country s language 
we also compete with the internal development efforts of certain of the ce device manufacturers to whom we license our solutions  most of which have greater financial  technical and other resources than we do 
similarly  we also face competition from font foundries  font related websites and independent professionals 
some of our current or future competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do  may enjoy greater name recognition than we do or may have more experience or advantages than we have in the markets in which they compete 
these advantages may include  among others sales and marketing advantages  advantages in the recruitment and retention of skilled personnel  advantages in the establishment and negotiation of profitable strategic  distribution and customer relationships  advantages in the development and acquisition of innovative software technology and the acquisition of software companies  greater ability to pursue larger scale product development and distribution initiatives on a global basis  substantially larger patent portfolios  and operational advantages 
further  many of the devices that incorporate our text imaging solutions also include technologies and fonts developed by our competitors 
as a result  we must continue to invest significant resources in product development in order to enhance our text imaging solutions and introduce new high quality solutions to meet the wide variety of competitive pressures 
our ability to generate revenue from our business could suffer if we fail to do so successfully 
our business is dependent in part on technologies and fonts we license from third parties and these license rights may be inadequate for our business 
certain of our text imaging solutions are dependent in part on the licensing and incorporation of technologies from third parties  and we license a substantial number of fonts from third parties 
for example  we have entered into license agreements with agfa gevaert nv under which we have acquired rights to use certain color technology 
we also have license agreements with microsoft  adobe and others under which we license certain fonts 
our license agreements with these parties are limited by the ownership or licensing rights of our licensors 
if any of the technologies we license from third parties fail to perform as expected  if our licensors do not continue to support any of their technology or intellectual property  including fonts  because they go out of business or otherwise  or if the technologies 
table of contents or fonts we license are subject to infringement claims  then we may incur substantial costs in replacing the licensed technologies or fonts or fall behind in our development schedule and our business plan while we search for a replacement 
in addition  replacement technology and fonts may not be available for license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
parties from whom we license text imaging solutions may challenge the basis for our calculations of the royalties due to them 
some of our agreements with licensors require us to give them the right to audit our calculations of royalties payable to them 
in addition  licensors may at any time challenge the basis of our calculations and we cannot be sure that we will be successful in our defense 
any royalties paid as a result of any successful challenge would increase our expenses and could negatively impact our relationship with such licensor  including by impairing our ability to continue to use and re license technologies or fonts from that licensor 
our business and prospects depend on the strength of our brands  and if we do not maintain and strengthen our brands  we may be unable to maintain or expand our business 
maintaining and strengthening the monotype and linotype brands  the fonts 
com  itcfonts 
com  linotype 
com and faces 
co 
uk brands  the fontexplorerx brand  as well as the brands of our fonts  such as helvetica and itc avant garde  is critical to maintaining and expanding our business  as well as to our ability to enter into new markets for our text imaging solutions 
if we fail to promote and maintain these brands successfully  our ability to sustain and expand our business and enter into new markets will suffer 
maintaining and strengthening our brands will depend heavily on our ability to continue to develop and provide innovative and high quality solutions for our customers  as well as to continue to maintain our strong online presence 
if we fail to maintain high quality standards  if we fail to meet industry standards  or if we introduce text imaging solutions that our customers or potential customers reject  the strength of our brands could be adversely affected 
further  unauthorized third parties may use our brands in ways that may dilute or undermine their strength 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  we could lose our intellectual property rights  which could negatively affect our revenue or dilute or undermine the strength of our brands 
our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to protect our intellectual property  including our fonts 
to protect our intellectual property  we rely on a combination of united states and international patents  design registrations  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret restrictions  end user license agreements  or eulas  and the implementation and enforcement of nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions 
despite these efforts  we may be unable to effectively protect our proprietary rights and the enforcement of our proprietary rights may be extremely costly 
for example  our ability to enforce intellectual property rights in the actual design of our fonts is limited 
we hold patents related to certain of our rasterizer and compression technologies and registered trademarks on many of our fonts 
our patents may be challenged or invalidated  patents may not issue from any of our pending applications or claims allowed from existing or pending patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength or may not issue in the countries where products incorporating our technology may be sold to provide meaningful protection or be of any commercial advantage to us 
some of our patents have been and or may be licensed or cross licensed to our competitors 
we rely on trademark protection for the names of our fonts 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and distribute our proprietary technologies and fonts 
also  many applications do not need to identify our fonts by name  such as those designs embedded in mobile telephones and set top boxes  and therefore may not need to license trademarked fonts 
we sometimes protect fonts by copyright registration but we do not always own the copyrights in fonts licensed from third parties 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will be able to enforce our copyrights against a third party who independently develops fonts even if it generates font designs identical to ours 

table of contents our eula generally permits the embedding of our fonts into an electronic document only for the purpose of viewing and printing the document  but technologies  including those related to web based fonts  may exist or may develop which allow unauthorized persons who receive such an embedded document to use the embedded font for editing the document or even to install the font into an operating system  the same as if the font had been properly licensed 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property or copying of our fonts may dilute or undermine the strength of our brands 
also  we may be unable to generate revenue from products that incorporate our text imaging solutions without our authorization 
monitoring unauthorized use of our text imaging solutions is difficult and expensive 
a substantial portion of the ce devices that require text imaging solutions are manufactured in china 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property will be effective  particularly in countries like the china where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside north america and  as a result  we face diverse risks related to engaging in international business 
we have offices in five foreign countries and we are dedicating a significant portion of our sales efforts in countries outside north america 
we are dependent on international sales for a substantial amount of our total revenue 
in and  approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue was derived from operations outside the u 
s and we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
this future international revenue will depend on the continued use and expansion of our text imaging solutions  including the licensing of our technologies and fonts worldwide 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including our ability to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights  especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent that the united states does  which increases the risk of unauthorized and uncompensated use of our text imaging solutions  united states and foreign government trade restrictions  including those that may impose restrictions on importation of programming  technology or components to or from the united states  foreign government taxes  regulations and permit requirements  including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes imposed upon us in the united states  and foreign tax and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to the united states  foreign labor laws  regulations and restrictions  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability  natural disasters  war and or events of terrorism  and the strength of international economies 
we are an international company and  as a result  we face significant foreign currency exchange rate risk we face risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  in particular fluctuations in the exchange rate of the japanese yen  the european union s euro  and the united kingdom s pound sterling  including risks related to hedging activities we may undertake 
for example  prior to instituting foreign currency hedging  we recorded losses on foreign currency exchange of million in primarily due to fluctuation in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar 

table of contents although we attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging  these activities may not effectively offset the adverse financial effect resulting from unfavorable movements in currency exchange rates 
our text imaging solutions compete with solutions offered by some of our customers  which have significant competitive advantages 
we face competitive risks in situations where our customers are also current or potential competitors 
for example  adobe is a significant licensee of our text imaging solutions  but adobe is also a competitor with respect to the licensing of technologies and fonts 
to the extent that adobe or our other customers choose to utilize competing text imaging solutions they have developed or in which they have an interest  rather than utilizing our solutions  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
adobe also offers broader product lines than we do  including software products outside of the text imaging solutions markets that provide adobe with greater opportunities to bundle and cross sell products to its large user base 
to the extent our customers were to offer text imaging solutions comparable to ours at a similar or lower price  our revenue could decline and our business would be harmed 
adoption of microsoft s xps printing language could have an adverse impact on our future licensing revenue 
with the introduction of the microsoft vista operating system  a new printing and networking subsystems language  referred to as xml paper specification language  or xps  was introduced to the market 
if the laser printer market shifts away from pcl and postscript to microsoft s xps language  our licensing revenue could be adversely affected 
we may be forced to litigate to defend our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims by third parties against us relating to intellectual property rights 
disputes and litigation regarding the ownership of technologies and fonts and rights associated with text imaging solutions  such as ours  are common  and sometimes involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence 
third parties have from time to time claimed  and in the future may claim  that our products and services infringe or violate their intellectual property rights 
any such claims could cause us to incur significant expenses and  if successfully asserted against us  could require that we pay substantial damages and prevent us from selling our products 
we may be forced to litigate to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of other parties proprietary rights 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners pursuant to any such litigation  which could further exhaust our resources 
furthermore  as a result of an intellectual property challenge  we may be required to enter into royalty  license or other agreements  and we may not be able to obtain such agreements at all or on terms acceptable to us 
we have been in the past involved in litigation with third parties  including adobe  to defend our intellectual property rights and have not always prevailed 
current and future industry standards may limit our business opportunities 
various industry leaders have adopted or are in the process of adopting standards for ce devices that incorporate  or have the potential to incorporate  our text imaging solutions 
although we have made some efforts to have our text imaging solutions adopted as standards by industry market leaders  these efforts 
table of contents have been limited and we do not control the ultimate decision with respect to whether our solutions will be adopted as industry standards in the future or  to the extent they are adopted  whether and for how long they will continue as such 
if industry standards adopted exclude our solutions  we will lose market share and our ability to secure the business of oems subject to those standards will be adversely affected 
costs or potential delays in the development of our solutions to comply with such standards could significantly increase our expenses and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to others who comply faster or in a more cost efficient way or those whose solutions are adopted as the industry standard 
we may also need to acquire or license additional intellectual property rights from third parties which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  and we may be required to license our intellectual property to third parties for purposes of standards compliance 
we rely on the manufacturers to whom we license our text imaging solutions to accurately prepare royalty reports for our determination of licensing revenue and if these reports are inaccurate  our revenue may be under  or over stated and our forecasts and budgets may be incorrect 
our license revenue is generated primarily from royalties paid by ce device manufacturers who license our text imaging solutions and incorporate them into their products 
under these arrangements  these licensees typically pay us a specified royalty for every consumer hardware device they ship that incorporates our text imaging solutions 
we rely on our licensees to accurately report the number of units shipped 
we calculate our license fees  prepare our financial reports  projections and budgets and direct our licensing and technology development efforts based in part on these reports 
however  it is often difficult for us to independently determine whether or not our licensees are reporting shipments accurately 
we understand that ce device manufacturers in specific countries have a history of underreporting or failing to report shipments of their products 
we have implemented an audit program of our licensees records  but the effects of this program may be limited as audits are generally expensive and time consuming and initiating audits could harm our relationships with licensees 
in addition  our audit rights are contractually limited 
to the extent that our licensees understate or fail to report the number of products incorporating our text imaging solutions that they ship  we will not collect and recognize revenue to which we are entitled 
alternatively  we may encounter circumstances in which an oem customer may notify us that it previously reported and paid royalties on units in excess of what the customer actually shipped 
in such cases  we may be required to give our licensee a credit for the excess royalties paid which would result in a reduction in revenue in the period in which a credit is granted  and such a reduction could be material 
the technologies in our text imaging solutions may be subject to open source licenses  which may restrict how we use or distribute our technologies or require that we release the source code of certain technologies subject to those licenses 
certain open source licenses  such as the gnu lesser general public license  require that source code subject to the license be released or made available to the public 
such open source licenses typically mandate that proprietary technologies  when combined in specific ways with open source software  become subject to the open source license 
we take steps to ensure that our proprietary technologies are not combined with  or do not incorporate  open source software in ways that would require our proprietary technologies to be subject to an open source license 
however  few courts have interpreted the open source licenses  and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to uncertainty 
while our eula prohibits the use of our technologies in any way that would cause them to become subject to an open source license  our oem customers could  in violation of our eula  combine our technologies with technologies covered by an open source license 
in addition  we rely on multiple software engineers to design our proprietary text imaging solutions 
although we take steps to ensure that our engineers do not include open source software in the technologies they design  we may not exercise complete control over the product development efforts of our engineers and we cannot be certain that they have not incorporated open source software into our 
table of contents proprietary technologies 
in the event that portions of our proprietary technologies are determined to be subject to an open source license  we might be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code  which could reduce or eliminate our ability to commercialize our text imaging solutions 
also  our ability to market our text imaging solutions depends in part on the existence of proprietary operating systems 
if freely distributed operating systems like linux become more prevalent  the need for our solutions may diminish and our revenue could be adversely affected 
finally  in the event we develop technologies that operate under or are delivered under an open source license  such technologies may have little or no direct financial benefit to us 
our licensing revenue depends in large part upon oems incorporating our text imaging solutions into their products and if our solutions are not incorporated in these products or fewer products are sold that incorporate our solutions  our revenue will be adversely affected 
our licensing revenue from oems depends upon the extent to which these oems embed our technologies in their products 
we do not control their decision whether or not to embed our solutions into their products  and we do not control their product development or commercialization efforts 
if we fail to develop and offer solutions that adequately or competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace  oems may not be willing to embed our solutions into their products 
the process utilized by oems to design  develop  produce and sell their products is generally to months in duration 
as a result  if an oem is unwilling or unable to embed our solutions into a product that it is manufacturing or developing  we may experience significant delays in generating revenue while we wait for that oem to begin development of a new product that may embed our solutions 
in addition  if oems sell fewer products incorporating our solutions  our revenue will be adversely affected 
we incur significant costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with changing laws and regulations  including those affecting public companies  which could affect our operating results 
we have incurred and will incur significant costs  and have and could experience internal resources constraints  associated with the evaluation of and compliance with evolving corporate governance  reporting and other requirements  including requirements under the sarbanes oxley act and the massachusetts data protection laws  as well as rules implemented by the sec  and the nasdaq global select market 
the expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing 
we expect that the rules and regulations applicable to us could cause our legal and financial compliance costs to increase and could make some activities more time consuming and costly 
in addition  in the current public company environment officers and directors are subject to increased scrutiny and may be subject to increased potential liability 
as a result  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers 
this could negatively impact our future success 
if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls in the future  our ability to produce accurate financial statements could be impaired  which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and maintain our stock price 
ensuring that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time consuming effort that needs to be re evaluated frequently 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and that our independent auditors separately report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
both we and our independent auditors test our internal controls in connection with the section requirements and could  as part of that documentation and testing  identify material weaknesses  significant deficiencies or other areas for further attention or improvement 
our networks may be vulnerable to security risks and hacker attacks  which may affect our ability to maintain effective internal controls as contemplated by section implementing any appropriate changes to our internal 
table of contents controls may require specific compliance training for our directors  officers and employees  entail substantial costs to modify our existing accounting systems  and take a significant period of time to complete 
such changes may not  however  be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls  and any failure to maintain that adequacy  or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis  could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business 
in addition  disclosure regarding our internal controls or investors perceptions that our internal controls are inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements may adversely affect our stock price 
because of their significant stock ownership  some of our existing stockholders are able to exert substantial control over us and our significant corporate decisions 
as of december   our executive officers  directors and their affiliates  in the aggregate  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these persons  acting together  have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval  including the election and removal of directors and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  these persons  acting together  have the ability to significantly influence the management and affairs of our company 
this concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock by  among other things delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company  causing us to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all stockholders  or discouraging potential acquirers from making offers to purchase our company 
our quarterly results and stock price may fluctuate significantly 
we expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations 
the revenue we generate and our operating results will be affected by numerous factors  including general economic conditions  demand for ce devices that include our text imaging solutions  demand for our fonts and custom font design services  delays in product shipment by our customers  industry consolidation  introduction  enhancement and market acceptance of text imaging solutions by us and our competitors  price reductions by us or our competitors or changes in how text imaging solutions are priced  the mix of text imaging solutions offered by us and our competitors  the mix of international and us revenue generated by our solutions  financial implications of acquisitions  in particular foreign acquisitions involving different accounting standards  foreign currency issues  international tax planning requirements and the like  timing of billings to customers on royalty reports received by us under our licensing agreements  and our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 
for example  as a result of the royalty reports received from laser printer and other ce device manufacturers  our oem revenue in the third quarter of was lower than the revenue in the prior 
table of contents quarter 
in the third quarter of our oem revenue declined by approximately million  compared to the prior quarter due to a decline in product shipments from our oem customers 
a substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is based on actual shipments by our customers of products incorporating our text imaging solutions in the preceding quarter  and not on contractually agreed upon minimum revenue commitments 
because the shipping of products by our customers is outside our control and difficult to predict  our ability to accurately forecast quarterly revenue is limited 
our revenue also varies from quarter to quarter as a result of variances on the timing of transactions through our e commerce websites 
in addition  under a fixed fee license agreement we have  we have agreed to certain reductions in the fee payable over a period of years 
quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may  in turn  cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially 
we believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
the loss of key members of our senior management team may prevent us from executing our business strategy 
our future success depends in large part upon the continued services of key members of our senior management team 
all of our executive officers and key employees are at will employees 
douglas j 
shaw  chief executive officer  has been with the company in various senior management roles for more than years 
mr 
shaw has been critical to the overall management of the company  as well as the development of our solutions  our culture and our strategic direction 
the loss of his services or of the services of other key members of our senior management could seriously harm our ability to execute our business strategy 
we also may have to incur significant costs in identifying  hiring  training and retaining replacements for key employees 
we rely on highly skilled personnel  and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel  we may not be able to maintain our operations or grow effectively 
our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals  including font designers who are recognized as leaders in the industry and experienced software engineers 
these individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to us and our operations 
these individuals can be terminated or can leave our employ at any time 
some of these individuals are consultants 
if any of these individuals or a group of individuals were to terminate their employment unexpectedly or end their consulting relationship sooner than anticipated  we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors  could incur significant costs in connection with their termination and could experience a loss in productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and experience 
our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify  hire  develop  motivate and retain highly skilled personnel and consultants for all areas of our organization 
in this regard  if we are unable to hire and train a sufficient number of qualified employees and consultants for any reason or retain employees or consultants with the required expertise  we may not be able to implement our current initiatives or grow effectively or execute our business strategy successfully 
if we have difficulty finding appropriate partnership and or acquisition candidates  our ability to execute aspects of our strategic plan may be hindered 
selectively  we intend to pursue complementary acquisitions  strategic partnerships and third party intellectual property licenses to accelerate our time to market  penetrate new geographies and expand our offering 
execution of our strategy relies on finding and closing partnerships and or acquisitions that fit with our business and that meet our financial expectations 
to the extent that we are unable to identify appropriate opportunities and close deals on acceptable financial terms  we may face hurdles in executing portions of our strategy 

table of contents we may expand through acquisitions of other companies  which may divert our management s attention or result in additional dilution to stockholders or use of resources that are necessary to operate other parts of our business 
as part of our business strategy  we may seek to acquire businesses  products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products  enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
acquisitions could create risks for us  including difficulties in assimilating acquired personnel  operations and technologies  unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with such acquisitions  incurrence of acquisition related costs  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business  and use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate such acquisitions 
in addition  a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets  which must be assessed for impairment at least annually 
in the future  if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns  we may be required to take charges to our earnings based on this impairment assessment process  which could harm our results of operations 
acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or in the incurrence of debt  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations  our operating results may suffer 

table of contents risks related to the securities markets and investment in our common stock our substantial indebtedness could affect our financing options and liquidity 
we have million of debt outstanding and an undrawn million revolving credit facility at december   however  availability under the line of credit was reduced by approximately million at december   as a result of our outstanding derivative instruments with our lender 
our indebtedness is secured by substantially all of our assets and could have important consequences to our business or the holders of our common stock  including limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions  requiring a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of the principal of and interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available for other purposes  making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures  and preventing us from paying dividends on our common stock 
we are subject to restrictive debt covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and could limit our ability to grow our business 
covenants in our credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions prohibit or limit  among other things  our incurrence of additional indebtedness  dividends and distributions  asset sales  some transactions with affiliates  certain acquisitions and creation of certain types of liens 
these restrictions could limit our ability to take advantage of business opportunities 
furthermore  our indebtedness requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and maintain a minimum level of cash through a liquidity covenant 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
if we are unable to comply with the covenants  leverage and liquidity ratios in our current credit facility in the future  we may be unable to obtain waivers of non compliance from the lenders  which would put us in default under the facility  or we may be required to pay substantial fees or penalties to the lenders 
if we are in default under the facility  the rate of interest we are charged on the facility could increase  which we may be unable to pay on a continual basis 
these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business 
market volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  most of which we cannot control  including announcements of new products  services or technologies  commercial relationships  acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors  fluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies  variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in our financial guidance or securities analysts estimates of our financial performance  changes in accounting principles  sales of large blocks of our common stock  including sales by our executive officers  directors and significant stockholders  
table of contents additions or departures of key personnel  discussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities  general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors  and other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors 
market prices of technology companies have been extremely volatile 
stock prices of many technology companies have often fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
in the past  following periods of market volatility  stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation 
if we were involved in securities litigation  it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of management from our business 
shares of our common stock are relatively illiquid 
there has only been a public market for our common stock since the completion of our initial public offering in july for the quarterly period ended december   the average daily trading volume of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market was less than  shares 
as a result of our relatively small public float  our common stock may be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership 
among other things  trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our shares than would be the case if our public float were larger 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult and may inhibit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management 
these provisions include a classified board of directors  a prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders and the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us 
although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders 
in addition  these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors  which is responsible for appointing the members of our management 
we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock 
we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development  operation and expansion of our business and the repayment of indebtedness and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
moreover  our credit agreement relating to our credit facility arranged by wells fargo foothill  inc  or amended and restated credit agreement  imposes restrictions on our ability to declare and pay dividends 
future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline 
our stockholders that held our stock prior to our initial public offering now hold a significant percentage of our outstanding shares of common stock 
any sale by us or our current stockholders of our 
table of contents common stock in the public market  or any distributions by partnership stockholders to their limited partners followed by a sale  or the perception that sales could occur  could adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock 
certain of the holders of our common stock prior to our initial public offering have rights  subject to some limited conditions  to demand that we file a registration statement on their behalf to register their shares or that we include their shares in a registration statement that we file on our behalf or on behalf of other stockholders 
if such demand rights are exercised pursuant to the terms and conditions of the registration rights agreement  we will incur significant expenses in connection with the filing of such registration statement 
additionally  the filing of a registration statement at the request of the stockholders may divert the attention of our senior management from our business operations 
we may require additional capital  and raising additional funds by issuing securities or additional debt financing may cause dilution to existing stockholders  restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
we may raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings or debt financings 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our existing stockholders ownership will be diluted 
any new debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations more than our current credit facilities 
these restrictive covenants would likely include limitations on additional borrowing  specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens  pay dividends  redeem our stock or make investments

overview we are a leading global provider of text imaging solutions 
our end user and embedded solutions for print  web and mobile environments enable people to create and consume dynamic content on any and every device 
our technologies and fonts enable the display and printing of high quality digital content 
our software technologies have been widely deployed across  and embedded in a range of ce devices  including laser printers  digital copiers  mobile phones  digital televisions  set top boxes  navigation devices and digital cameras  as well as in numerous software applications and operating systems 
in the laser printer market  we have worked together with industry leaders for over years to provide critical components embedded in printing standards 
our scaling  compression  text layout  printer driver and color technologies solve critical text imaging issues for ce device manufacturers by rendering high quality text on low resolution and memory constrained ce devices 
we combine these proprietary technologies with access to more than  typefaces from a library of some of the most widely used designs in the world  including popular names such as helvetica and times new roman 
we also license our typefaces to creative and business professionals through our e commerce websites fonts 
com  linotype 
com  itcfonts 
com  faces 
co 
uk and fontexplorerx 
com  which attracted more than million visits in from over countries and territories  direct and indirect sales and custom font design services 
on december   we acquired the principal assets of planetweb  inc  a global provider of embedded user interface software  and developer tools for the ce device industry  located in redwood shores  california  for million 
we are accounting for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc  topic no 
 business combinations  or asc on october   we implemented a restructuring plan 
under the restructuring plan  we reduced headcount in an effort to improve operational efficiencies  primarily within the creative professional area of our business  and we are consolidating certain functions of our european operations within our united kingdom office 
the plan provides for the elimination of positions worldwide 
we expect to record a total charge of approximately million for severance and termination benefits associated with this plan 
approximately thousand was recognized in the third quarter of 
table of contents related to the termination of one employee prior to the implementation of the full restructuring plan 
in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc  topic no 
 exit or disposal cost obligations  or asc  if an employee continues to work beyond a minimum period of time after notification  the termination benefits are to be accrued over the period that they continue to work 
as certain of the employees are required to continue working beyond the minimum periods specified in asc in order to receive their termination benefits  we will accrue such benefits over the remaining term of employment 
we recorded charges to operations of approximately million in the fourth quarter of and expect to record approximately million and million in the first and second quarters of  respectively  as a result of the restructuring plan 
we expect the restructuring actions to be completed in the second quarter of sources of revenue we derive revenue from two principal sources licensing our text imaging solutions to ce device manufacturers and independent software vendors  which we refer to as our oem revenue  and licensing our fonts to creative and business professionals  which we refer to as our creative professional revenue 
we derive our oem revenue primarily from ce device manufacturers 
we derive our creative professional revenue primarily from multinational corporations  graphic designers  advertisers  printers and publishers 
historically  we have experienced  and we expect to continue to have  lower revenue in the first quarter of the year due to the timing of some contractual payments of licensing fees from our oem customers 
in prior years we have experienced  and we may in the future have  seasonal slowness in the third quarter of the year from our creative professional customers 
in  given the economic conditions  traditional patterns of seasonality did not materialize 
our overall trends in were primarily impacted by the broader economic downturn 
our customers are located in the united states  asia  europe and throughout the rest of the world  and our operating subsidiaries are located in the united states  japan  the united kingdom  germany and hong kong 
we are dependent on international sales by our foreign operating subsidiaries for a substantial amount of our total revenue 
revenue from our asian subsidiaries is generally from asian customers and revenue from our other subsidiaries is from customers in a number of different countries  including the united states 
we attribute revenue to geographic areas based on the location of our subsidiary receiving such revenue 
for example  licenses may be sold to large international companies which may be headquartered in korea  but the sales are received and recorded by our subsidiary located in the united states 
in this example  the revenue would be reflected in the united states totals in the table below 
sales of total sales of total sales of total in thousands of dollars  except united states asia united kingdom germany total for the years ended december   and  sales by our subsidiaries located outside north america comprised  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
we expect that sales by our international subsidiaries will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
future international revenue will depend on the continued use and expansion of our text imaging solutions worldwide 

table of contents we derive a majority of our revenue from a limited number of customers  in particular manufacturers of laser printers and mobile phones 
for the years ended december   and  our top ten licensees by revenue accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue  respectively 
no one customer accounted for more than of our total revenue in  and cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists of font license fees that we pay on certain fonts that are owned by third parties  allocated internal engineering expense and overhead costs directly related to custom design services 
license fees that we pay to third parties are typically based on a percentage of our oem and creative professional revenue and do not involve minimum fees 
our cost of oem revenue is typically lower than our cost of creative professional revenue because we own a higher percentage of the fonts licensed to our oem customers  provide value added technology and have negotiated lower royalty rates on the fonts we license from third parties because of volume 
the cost of our custom design service revenue is substantially higher than the cost of our other revenue and  as a result  our gross margin varies from period to period depending on the level of custom design revenue recorded 
cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquired technology  which we amortize over to years 
for purposes of amortizing acquired technology we estimate the remaining useful life of the technology based upon various considerations  including our knowledge of the technology and the way our customers use it 
we use the straight line method to amortize our acquired technology 
there is no reliable evidence to suggest that we should expect any other pattern of amortization than an even pattern  and we believe this best reflects the expected pattern of economic usage 
gross profit our gross profit percentage is influenced by a number of factors including product mix  pricing and volume at any particular time 
however  our cost of oem revenue is typically lower than our cost of creative professional revenue because we own a higher percentage of the fonts licensed to our oem customers  provide value added technology and have negotiated lower royalty rates on the fonts we license from third parties because of volume 
in addition  the cost of our custom design service revenue is substantially higher than the cost of our other revenue 
as a result  our gross profit varies from period to period depending on the mix between  and within  oem and creative professional revenue 
marketing and selling our marketing and selling expense consists of salaries  bonuses  commissions and benefits related to our marketing and selling personnel  business travel expenses  advertising and trade show expenses  web related expenses  allocated facilities costs and other overhead expenses 
sales commission expense varies as a function of revenue and goal achievement from period to period 
during our marketing and selling expenses increased as compared to mainly due to personnel related expenses resulting from a shift in of headcount from development related activities to a focus on presale customer support and commercial website development 
research and development our research and development expense consists of salaries  bonuses and benefits related to our research and development  engineering  font design and integration support personnel and their business travel expenses  license fees related to certain of our technology licenses  expenses for contracted services and allocated facilities costs and other overhead expenses 
our research and development expense in a given period may be reduced to the extent that internal engineering resources are allocated to cost of revenue for custom design services 

table of contents our research and development is primarily focused on enhancing the functionality of our text imaging solutions and developing new products 
from time to time we license third party font technology in connection with new technology development projects that are part of our research and development efforts 
our research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
during research and development expense decreased  as compared to  primarily the result of the decrease in personnel related expenses stemming from the headcount shift from development related activities to a focus on presale customer support and commercial website development in general and administrative our general and administrative expense consists of salaries  bonuses and benefits related to our general and administrative personnel  accounting  legal and other professional fees  allocated facilities costs and other overhead expenses and insurance costs 
in  our general and administrative expenses were significantly lower than in  primarily due to a decline in discretionary spending and the cost of the restructuring actions taken in the fall of costs incurred to date with respect to our restructuring were substantially less than the costs of the restructuring 
restructuring on november   the company implemented a restructuring plan 
under the restructuring plan  the company reduced headcount in certain areas and redeployed certain other employees within the company in order to focus on key initiatives across the business 
the small headcount reduction was intended to be offset by the hiring of a few key additional employees whose technical expertise was better aligned with our key initiatives and we did not experience an overall change in headcount 
the restructuring plan was completed in april  other than making deferred cash payments to certain terminated employees 
we implemented a second restructuring plan on october   which included certain actions that were taken during the three months ended september  in advance of finalizing the plan 
details of this restructuring plan are described in the overview section above 
in the year ended december   we recorded million of restructuring costs for severance and termination benefits for both plans  which is included in our operating expenses 
future cash expenditures related to these plans are expected to be approximately million  net of tax savings 
amortization of intangible assets we amortize intangible assets acquired as follows customer relationships to years  acquired technology to years  and non compete agreements to years 
for purposes of amortization  we estimate the life of customer relationships based upon various considerations  including our knowledge of the industry and the marketplace in which we operate 
we amortize non compete agreements over the stated life of the agreement 
we use the straight line method to amortize our intangible assets 
there is no reliable evidence to suggest that we should expect any other pattern of amortization than an even pattern  and we believe this best reflects the expected pattern of economic usage 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and 
table of contents accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
additional information about our critical accounting policies may be found in note to our consolidated financial statements in item revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with asc topic no 
 revenue recognition  or asc revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the product has been delivered or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
oem revenue our oem revenue is derived substantially from per unit royalties received for printer imaging  display imaging and printer driver  or driver  products 
under our licensing arrangements we typically receive a royalty for each product unit incorporating our text imaging solutions that is shipped by our oem customers 
we also receive oem revenue from fixed fee licenses with certain of our oem customers 
fixed fee licensing arrangements are not based on units the customer ships  but instead  customers pay us on a periodic basis for use of our text imaging solutions 
although significantly less than royalties from per unit shipments and fixed fees from oem customers  we also receive revenue from software application and operating systems vendors  who include our text imaging solutions in their products  and for font development 
many of our per unit royalty licenses continue for the duration that our oem customers ship products that include our technology  unless terminated for breach 
other licenses have terms that typically range from three to five years  and usually provide for automatic or optional renewals 
we recognize revenue from per unit royalties in the period during which we receive a royalty report from a customer  typically one quarter after royalty bearing units are shipped 
revenue from fixed fee licenses is generally recognized when it is billed to the customer  so long as the product has been delivered  the license fee is fixed and non refundable and collection is probable 
creative professional revenue our creative professional revenue is derived from font licenses and from custom font design services 
we license fonts directly to end users through our e commerce websites  via telephone  email and indirectly through third party resellers 
we also license fonts and provide custom font design services to graphic designers  advertising agencies and corporations 
revenue from font licenses to our e commerce customers is recognized upon payment by the customer and electronic shipment of the software embodying the font 
revenue from font licenses to other customers is recognized upon shipment of the software embodying the font and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenue from resellers is recognized upon notification from the reseller that our font product has been licensed and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
custom font design services are generally recognized upon delivery 
goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and long lived assets we assess the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets exceeds their fair value 
with respect to both goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  exiting an activity 
table of contents in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  or current  historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with an asset 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of useful lives and future cash flows  including assumptions about future conditions such as future revenue  operating expenses  the fair values of certain assets based on appraisals and industry trends 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
if this resulted in an impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in light of the continued macro economic environment  declines in the stock market and the decline of the company s market capitalization  we may be required to perform interim goodwill impairment analyses 
should our stock price deteriorate to a level at which  if sustained  it may require us to perform goodwill impairment analysis  as detailed above 
this analysis may determine that our goodwill is impaired in whole  in part  or not at all 
in the event that the company determines that its goodwill is impaired in whole  or in part  the company will record a non cash charge  which could be material 
if an impairment of goodwill is recognized  an analysis of impairment of our other long lived assets would be required pursuant to asc topic no 
in the event that the company determines that these assets are impaired  the company will record a non cash charge  which could be material 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with asc topic no 
 compensation stock compensation or asc  which requires the measurement of compensation costs at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
prior to our initial public offering  or ipo  on july  there was no public market for our common stock  and  in connection with our issuance of stock options  our board of directors  with the assistance of management  had the ultimate responsibility for determining the value of our common stock 
in the absence of a public market for our common stock  the board of directors considered objective and subjective factors in determining the fair value of our common stock  including the liquidation preferences  redemption rights and conversion rights of our then outstanding convertible preferred stock and the likelihood and timing of achieving a liquidity event such as an initial public offering or sale of the company 
our compensation committee followed the procedures recommended in the american institute of certified public accountants technical practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation for valuing our common stock 
this approach requires an assessment of future prospects  based on the value of the business using a series of potential outcomes and weighing the probability of each of those outcomes 
management prepared three scenarios  a base case  an optimistic case and a pessimistic case 
the possibility of an initial public offering was also considered 
the compensation committee reviewed a market comparison of our business with a number of publicly traded firms to test the reasonableness of the overall analysis 
the compensation committee reviewed the methodology  the resulting valuation and changed the probabilities of the outcomes that were initially applied as well as the weight given to those probabilities to more accurately reflect the changes in the business 
at the date of each option grant  our board of directors determined that the exercise price for each option was equivalent to the then existing fair value of our common stock 
our board of directors believes it properly valued our common stock in all periods 
since our ipo  we have valued awards granted based on the grant date closing price of our common stock as traded on the nasdaq global market or the nasdaq global select market  as applicable 
the 
table of contents company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of options granted and recognizes the compensation cost of share based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards using the black scholes model are affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we do not have a long history of market prices of our common stock and as such we estimate volatility in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  using historical volatilities of similar public entities 
the expected life of the awards is estimated based on the simplified method  as defined in sab the risk free interest rate assumption is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of our awards 
the expected dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of paying no dividends 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
share based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis and if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
future stock based compensation expense and unearned stock based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 
during the year ended december   we recorded total share based compensation expense of million  of which million is associated with the china type design restricted shares 
during the year ended december   we recorded total share based compensation expense of million  which included a credit of approximately million associated with the china type design restricted shares 
during the year ended december   we recorded total share based compensation expense of million  of which million was associated with the china type design restricted shares 
in connection with our initial public offering  three promissory notes issued in connection with the acquisition of china type design were converted into  shares of restricted common stock 
these shares vest over a four year period that commenced upon the issuance of the notes in july and will be fully vested in july as of december   the company had million of unrecognized compensation expense related to employees and directors unvested stock option awards and restricted share awards that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
pension plan we account for our defined benefit pension plan in accordance with asc subtopic no 
 defined benefit plans pension 
our unfunded defined benefit pension plan was acquired in connection with our acquisition of linotype on august  the plan covers substantially all employees of our linotype subsidiary who joined linotype prior to april   at which time the pension plan was closed to new participants 
benefits under this plan are based on the employees years of service and compensation 
we fund the plan sufficiently to meet current benefits only 
there are no assets associated with the plan 
in and we paid thousand and thousand  respectively  to the plan participants 
at december  and  our unfunded position was million and million  respectively 
a significant portion of the pension benefit obligation is determined based on the rate of future compensation increases 
given the fact that the pension plan is unfunded  changes in economic and market conditions may require us to increase cash contributions in future years 

table of contents provision for income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with asc topic no 
 income taxes 
under this method  a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  as measured by enacted tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to be reversed 
this process includes estimating current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe recovery to be unlikely  we have established a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially affected if actual results significantly differ from these estimates or the estimates are adjusted in future periods 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets  including foreign tax credits  where we have determined that their future use is uncertain 
asc requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered  including a company s performance  the market environment in which the company operates  length of carry back and carry forward periods  existing sales backlog  future taxable income projections and tax planning strategies 
we have historically provided valuation allowances on certain tax assets  due to the uncertainty of generating taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction and of the appropriate character to realize such assets 
in these instances  the company has made the determination that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax will not be realized 
we will continue to review our deferred tax position on a periodic basis and will reflect any change in judgment as a discrete item in the related period 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period that the assessments are made or resolved  or when the statute of limitations for certain periods expires 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing the future impact of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the tax effect of these temporary differences is shown on our december  consolidated balance sheet see note to our consolidated financial statements and denotes these differences as a net deferred tax liability of million 
this consists of total deferred tax liabilities of million and net deferred tax assets of million after providing a valuation allowance of million

additionally  asc changed previous guidance  in part  as follows contingent consideration arrangements are fair valued at the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration  transaction costs are expensed as incurred  rather than capitalized as part of the purchase price  pre acquisition contingencies  such as legal issues  will generally have to be accounted for in purchase accounting at fair value  and in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting  the requirements in fasb asc topic no 
 exit or disposal cost obligations  or asc  would have to be met at the acquisition date 
we adopted asc on january   and applied it in accounting for our acquisition of the principal assets of planetweb  inc in december there was no impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements on the accounting for acquisitions completed by december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources initial public offering on july   we completed our initial public offering  issuing million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
concurrent with the offering  all of our outstanding convertible redeemable preferred shares were converted into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and  shares of redeemable preferred stock which were redeemed in connection with the offering 
after underwriter s commissions and other costs and expenses  we received net proceeds of approximately million and paid the redemption cost of the redeemable preferred stock which totaled approximately million 
we used the net proceeds from the offering  net proceeds of million from the amendment to our first lien credit facility and million of cash on hand  to pay in full the outstanding borrowings under our second lien credit facility of approximately million  plus a million prepayment penalty 
the changes to our outstanding debt are described in credit facilities  below 
cash flows for the years ended december   and since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations  private and public stock sales and long term debt arrangements  as described below 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents  our cash flow from operating activities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
at december   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling million and a million revolving line of credit which was undrawn at december  and  however  availability under the line of credit  was reduced by approximately million at december  and as a result of our outstanding derivative instruments with our lender 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the operations of our existing business  our potential strategic expansion  and future acquisitions we might undertake 
to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents  our current debt arrangements and our cash flow from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements or public or private equity or debt financings 
in the event additional funding is required  we may not be able to obtain bank credit arrangements or effect an equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us  especially in light of the economic downturn and the inability or unwillingness of lenders to extend credit 
the following table presents our cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities for the periods presented in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents total increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities since  our operating activities have generated positive cash flows 
significant variations in operating cash flows frequently occur because  from time to time  our customers make prepayments against future royalties 
prepayments may be required under the terms of our license agreements and are occasionally made on an elective basis and often cause large fluctuations in accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
the timing and extent of such prepayments significantly impact our cash balances

accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities generated million in cash during the year  which was partially offset by a reduction in our prepaid expenses and other assets and deferred revenue of million 
the increase in accrued expenses was mainly due to an increase in foreign sales tax in the current year 
we had a one time tax exemption in from foreign sales tax in a particular jurisdiction 
net cash provided by accrued income taxes of million was partially offset by a use of cash from income tax refund receivable of million mainly the result of a lower german effective tax rate and an increase in the amount of our tax deduction for goodwill

upon entering into our amended and restated credit agreement on july   the principal amount of our term loan was increased to million payable in monthly installments of approximately million throughout the term of the facility  which expires in july the amended and restated credit agreement provides for an additional annual mandatory principal payment based on excess cash flow  as defined by the agreement  or million  for  which must be paid within five days of the delivery of our audited financial statements 
also on july   in connection with the initial public offering of our common stock  and with the amendment and restatement of our first lien credit facility  we paid in full the balance of million on our second lien credit facility  plus a prepayment penalty of million 
the prepayment penalty has been recognized as a debt extinguishment expense  along with approximately million of previously capitalized debt financing costs that were written off upon the payoff and termination of the second lien credit facility 
the first and second lien credit facilities were originally entered into in november  to partially finance our acquisition from agfa 
interest rates on borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement were at either i the prime rate plus  as defined by the credit agreement  or ii the london inter bank offering rate  or libor  plus a  payable monthly 
the amended and restated credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets and places limitations on indebtedness  liens  dividends and distributions  asset sales  transactions with affiliates and acquisitions and conduct of business  all as defined in the agreements 
in addition  the amended and restated credit agreement provides that we maintain a maximum leverage ratio 
the leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of aggregate outstanding indebtedness to trailing twelve months adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is defined as consolidated net earnings or loss  plus net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and share based compensation expense 
the amended and restated credit agreement also contains a no material adverse change clause 
in may  we amended our first lien and second lien credit facilities to define adjusted ebitda as described above 
in july  we terminated our second lien credit facility and recognized approximately million of debt extinguishment expense 
we also amended our first lien credit facility to provide additional borrowings  reduce our interest rate and modify covenants  however  the adjusted ebitda definition was not changed 
on april   we amended our first lien credit facility to increase the beneficial ownership threshold in the change of control definition 

table of contents on october   the company  monotype imaging inc  imaging holdings corp  international typeface corporation collectively  the borrowers entered into a second amendment the second amendment to our amended and restated credit agreement 
the second amendment amended  among other items  the following terms modified exceptions to the negative covenants to permit the borrowers to create unsecured subordinated indebtedness represented by seller notes in connection with permitted acquisitions  provided that such indebtedness does not exceed  in the aggregate 
modified the definition of adjusted ebitda by  among other things  allowing for the add back of restructuring  issuance and cash non operating costs and other expenses or losses which do not represent a cash item 
restructuring  issuance and cash non operating costs include fees  costs and expenses incurred by the company and its subsidiaries in connection with stock registrations and issuances  debt modifications  business restructurings and cash non operating expenses  provided that all such cash non operating expenses shall not exceed  and all such fees  costs and expense shall not exceed  in each case on a trailing twelve month basis 
increased the prime rate margin to from and libor rate margin to from 
the excess cash flow definition was modified to permit  among other things  the exclusion of cash payments made to fund permitted discrete asset acquisitions and permitted acquisitions from the calculation of excess cash flow 
a permitted discrete asset acquisition pursuant to the second amendment is an acquisition by any loan party of certain non operational assets of any person which  among other conditions  are related to the borrowers business and have a purchase price not in excess of  the purchase price for all such acquisitions shall not exceed  in the aggregate 
the permitted acquisition definition was modified to  among other things  include acquisitions by any loan party and by certain non us subsidiaries of the company which  among other requirements  i have a purchase price which does not exceed an aggregate amount of  together with all other acquisitions consummated during any fiscal year and ii immediately prior to and after giving effect to such acquisition  the borrowers have unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of  either through the company s line of credit or cash on hand 
the permitted investment definition was modified to  among other things  include investments by loan parties in certain non us subsidiaries of the company in an aggregate amount during any fiscal year not to exceed  for the purpose of funding permitted acquisitions  as defined in the second amendment 
required the company to make a prepayment of principal of the term loan in an aggregate amount equal to  together with accrued interest on such principal amount being prepaid through the date of prepayment as well an amendment fee of million  which was accounted for as a debt discount 
accordingly  these costs are amortized into interest expense over the life of the related loans using the effective interest method 
as of december   the maximum leverage ratio permitted was and our leverage ratio was 
the maximum leverage ratio decreased by in the quarter ended march  to  from 
it will remain at for the remainder of the term of the agreement 
as of december   the blended interest rate on the amended and restated credit agreement was 
there was no change to the leverage covenant ratio 
we do not expect that the leverage and liquidity covenants will affect our ability to operate our business and we expect will be able to meet these compliance requirements in the future 

table of contents the following table presents a reconciliation from net income  which is the most directly comparable gaap operating performance measure  to ebitda and from ebitda to adjusted ebitda as defined in our credit facilities in thousands year ended december  net income provision for income taxes interest expense  net depreciation and amortization ebitda share based compensation non cash add backs n a n a restructuring  issuance and cash non operating costs n a n a acquisition expenses n a n a adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is not a measure of operating performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for gaap profitability measures such as income loss from operations and net income loss 
adjusted ebitda as an operating performance measure has material limitations since it excludes the statement of income impact of depreciation and amortization expense  interest expense  net  the provision benefit for income taxes and share based compensation and therefore does not represent an accurate measure of profitability  particularly in situations where a company is highly leveraged or has a disadvantageous tax structure 
we have significant intangible assets and amortization expense is a meaningful element in our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from adjusted ebitda is a material limitation 
we have a significant amount of debt  and interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and therefore its exclusion from adjusted ebitda is a material limitation 
we generally incur significant us federal  state and foreign income taxes each year and the provision benefit for income taxes is a necessary element of our costs and therefore its exclusion from adjusted ebitda is a material limitation 
share based compensation and the associated expense has a meaningful impact on our financial statements 
non cash expenses  restructuring  issuance and cash non operating expenses have a meaningful impact on our financial statements 
therefore  their exclusion from adjusted ebitda is a material limitation 
as a result  adjusted ebitda should be evaluated in conjunction with net income loss for complete analysis of our profitability  as net income loss includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable gaap operating performance measure to adjusted ebitda 
as adjusted ebitda is not defined by gaap  our definition of adjusted ebitda may differ from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies  thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of the limitations that adjusted ebitda has as an analytical tool  investors should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under gaap 
the definition of adjusted ebitda was modified on october  as detailed above 
as a result  certain add backs to adjusted ebitda are not applicable in years ended december  and permits an add back of up to thousand of cash non operating expense  which is not to exceed million when combined together with restructuring and issuance costs 
the amended and restated credit agreement also contains provisions for an increased interest rate during periods of default 
we do not believe that these covenants will affect our ability to operate our business  and we were in compliance with the covenants under our amended and restated credit agreement as of december

contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases license fees total see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report under item see note to the audited consolidated financial statements regarding contractual obligations included in this report under item in addition to the above  we have contractual obligations under our interest rate swap and currency swap instruments at december  the interest rate swap contract has a notional amount of million and matures on november  under the terms of the agreement  we pay a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount of and receive interest on the notional amount at the floating one month libor rate  which at december  was 
net settlements are due monthly 
under the currency swap contract  we pay million euros and we receive payments of million quarterly 
the currency swap contract terminates on december we may be required to make cash outlays related to our unrecognized tax benefits 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits of million as of december  have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information on unrecognized tax benefits  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report under item in addition to the above  we have a pension obligation under the linotype defined benefit pension plan 
the total projected benefit obligation is million and details regarding this plan are located in note to our consolidated financial statement included in this report under item legal proceedings and disputes details on recent legal matters can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report under item off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities  often referred to as special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
other than our operating leases for office space and computer equipment  and derivative financial instruments discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk  including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk 

table of contents concentration of revenue and credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables 
cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposits and overnight repurchase agreements 
deposits of cash held outside the united states totaled approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
we grant credit to customers in the ordinary course of business 
credit evaluations are performed on an ongoing basis to reduce credit risk  and no collateral is required from our customers 
an allowance for uncollectible accounts is provided for those accounts receivable considered to be uncollectible based upon historical experience and credit evaluation 
as of december  two customers  okidata corporation and samsung individually accounted for and  respectively  of our gross accounts receivable 
as of december  one customer  nokia accounted for of our gross accounts receivable 
due to the nature of our quarterly revenue streams derived from royalty revenue  it is not unusual for our accounts receivable balances to include a few customers with large balances 
historically  we have not recorded material losses due to customers nonpayment 
for the years ended december   and  no customer accounted for more than of our revenue 
interest rate risk we use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to interest rate volatility resulting from our variable rate debt  as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report under item asc topic no 
 derivatives and hedging  or asc  requires that all derivative instruments be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships  including a requirement that all designations must be made at the inception of each instrument 
as we did not make such initial designations  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument to be recognized as current period income or expense 
the fair value of derivative instruments is estimated based on the amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting date 
our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt 
the interest rate on our amended and restated credit agreement fluctuates with either the prime rate or the libor interest rate 
at december   the blended rate of interest on our outstanding debt was 
for each one percent increase in interest rates our interest expense would increase by million  however  this would be mitigated by our interest rate swap 
we purchase interest rate swap instruments to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our debt obligations 
on november  we entered into a long term interest rate swap contract to pay a fixed rate of interest of in exchange for a floating rate interest payment tied to the one month libor 
the contract has a notional amount of million and matures on november  the total fair value of the financial instrument at december  and was a liability of approximately million and million  respectively 
in and  we recognized a loss of million and million  respectively  which has been included in loss gain on derivatives in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
we purchase interest rate cap instruments to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our debt obligations 
at december  and we had one interest rate cap contract outstanding totaling million 
the contract has a fixed rate of and expires on december  the notional amount decreased million during  with other additional reductions scheduled until it reaches a notional amount of million at maturity  to approximate the outstanding balance on our debt over the same period of time 
under this contract  to the extent that libor exceeds a fixed maximum rate  we will receive payments on the notional amount 
at december   there was a 
table of contents shortfall of approximately million of our total debt that was unhedged 
the total fair value of these financial instruments at december  and was approximately thousand and thousand  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk in accordance with asc topic no 
 foreign currency matters  or asc  all assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than us dollars are translated into us dollars at an exchange rate as of the balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated at the average monthly exchange rates 
the resulting translation adjustments as calculated from the translation of the foreign subsidiaries to us dollars are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we also incur foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to certain customers that are invoiced in us dollars  but who have the option to make an equivalent payment in their own functional currencies at a specified exchange rate as of a specified date 
in the period from that date until payment in the customer s functional currency is received and converted into us dollars  we can incur realized gains and losses 
to mitigate our exposure we utilize forward contracts with maturities of days or less to hedge our exposure to these currency fluctuations 
any increase or decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged assets of our consolidated foreign affiliate 
at december  and there were no currency contracts outstanding 
in addition  we incur foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses on an intercompany note with one of our foreign subsidiaries that is denominated in euros 
at december  the note balance was approximately million 
the effect of an immediate strengthening of the us dollar as compared to the euro would result in a million unrealized transaction loss on this note receivable which would be reported in gain loss on foreign exchange within our results of operations  however  this would be mitigated by our currency swap 
on may   we entered into a long term currency swap contract to purchase million euros in exchange for million to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuation risk on this note 
the contract payment terms approximate the payment terms of this intercompany note and the notional amount is amortized down over time as payments are made 
the total fair value of the currency swap instrument at december  was million 
for the year ended december  and  we incurred a loss of million and a gain of million  respectively  on the currency swap contract which is included in loss gain on derivatives in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
prior to may   this note was unhedged 
the loss and gain on the intercompany note are included in gain loss on foreign exchange in the accompanying consolidated statements of income
