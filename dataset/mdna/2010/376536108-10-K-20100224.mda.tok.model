item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview general we were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the state of maryland on february   primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net leased industrial and commercial real property and selectively making long term industrial and commercial mortgage loans 
most of the portfolio of real estate we currently own is leased to a wide cross section of tenants ranging from small businesses to large public companies  many of which are corporations that do not have publicly rated debt 
we have in the past entered into  and intend in the future to enter into  purchase agreements for real estate having triple net leases with terms of approximately to years and built in rental increases 
under a triple net lease  the tenant is required to pay all operating  maintenance and insurance costs and real estate taxes with respect to the leased property 
we are actively communicating with buyout funds  real estate brokers and other third parties to locate properties for potential acquisition or to provide mortgage financing in an effort to build our portfolio 
at december   we owned properties totaling approximately million square feet  and had one mortgage loan outstanding 
the total gross investment in these acquisitions  including the million mortgage loan investment  was approximately million at december  business environment the united states remains in a recession  and  as a result  conditions within the global credit markets and the us real estate credit markets in particular continue to experience dislocation and stress 
while we are beginning to see signs of economic improvement and stabilization in the equity markets  the debt markets are still difficult at best  and we do not know if adverse conditions will again intensify  nor are we able to gauge the full extent to which the disruptions will affect us 
additionally  conditions continue to disrupt our ability to price and finance new investment opportunities on attractive terms 
we believe that it will take some time for the united states to fully recover from the recession 
as a result  the continued weak economic conditions could still adversely impact the financial condition of one or more of our tenants and therefore  could make a tenant bankruptcy and payment default on the related lease or loan more likely 
currently  all of our properties are fully leased and all of our tenants and our borrower are current and paying in accordance with their leases and loan  respectively  however  we have three leases that expire in  which comprise approximately of our total annualized rental income 
two of these tenants have notified us that they will not renew their leases  and we are currently seeking new tenants for these properties in addition  we have million of balloon principal payments due under one of our long term mortgages in  however the mortgage has three annual extension options through  which we currently intend to exercise 
we have no other balloon principal payments due under any of our mortgages until our ability to make new investments is highly dependent upon external financing 
our principal sources of external financing generally include the issuance of equity securities  long term mortgages secured by properties  and borrowings under our line of credit 
the market for long term mortgages remains frozen as the collateralized mortgage backed securities  or cmbs  market has virtually disappeared 
with the closure of the cmbs market  many banks are not lending on commercial real estate as they are no longer able to sell these loans to the cmbs market and are not willing or able to keep these loans on their balance sheets 
we are now only seeing banks willing to issue medium term mortgages  between two and five years  on substantially less favorable terms than were previously available 
consequently  we intend to focus on using medium term mortgages to finance our real estate until the market for long term mortgages returns 
our ability to increase the availability under our line of credit is dependent upon us pledging additional properties as collateral 
traditionally  we have pledged new properties to the line of credit as we arrange for long term mortgages for these pledged properties 
currently  only nine of our properties do not have long term mortgages  and eight of those are pledged as collateral under our line of credit 
our line of credit matures in december  and we are currently in the process of searching for replacement financing for the line of credit 
on november   we entered into an open market sale agreement  or the open market sale agreement  with jefferies company  inc  or jefferies  under which we may  from time to time  offer and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to million through or to jefferies  for resale 
to date  we have not sold any common stock under the open market sale agreement 
on november   we entered into a dealer manager agreement  or the dealer manager agreement  with halcyon capital markets  llc  or halcyon  pursuant to which halcyon will act as our dealer manager in connection with a proposed continuous private offering of up to  shares of our newly designated senior common stock at per share 
to date  we have not sold any senior common stock under the dealer manager agreement 
if we are able to raise equity capital in the near term  we will continue to invest in industrial and commercial real property as well as expand our investment portfolio to other categories  such as retail and medical properties 
furthermore  we intend to expand our mortgage lending activity to include purchasing mortgage loans from banks and cmbs pools 
however  until we are able to raise debt or equity capital  our near term strategy is contingent upon building the value of our existing portfolio of properties by renegotiating existing leases and making capital improvements to our properties 
capital improvements will be limited to the extent we have available capital 
we will continue to actively seek potential acquisitions and we will continue our strategy of making conservative investments in properties that have existing financing sufficient to weather the current economic conditions  and that are likely to produce attractive long term returns for our stockholders 
recent events financing activities on november   we through our wholly owned subsidiary  gladstone commercial limited partnership  exercised our option under our existing credit agreement with keybank national association  or keybank  and certain other parties to extend the term of our million line of credit by one year  resulting in a new maturity date of december  the loan was originally set to expire on december  during the year ended december   we had net borrowings under our line of credit of approximately million  with million outstanding at december  the proceeds from borrowings under the line of credit were used to pay off a million unsecured short term loan with keybank and fund other capital improvements at certain of our properties 
leasing activities on may   we extended the lease on our property located in eatontown  new jersey for a period of years  and the tenant has two options to extend the lease for additional periods of years each 
the lease was originally set to expire in august  and will now expire in april the lease provides for prescribed rent escalations over the life of the lease  with annualized straight line rents of approximately  on november   we extended the lease with one of our tenants in our property located in akron  ohio for a period of five years 
the lease was originally set to expire in february  and will now expire in march the lease provides for prescribed rent escalations over the life of the lease  with annualized straight line rents of approximately  dispositions on july   we sold our property located in norfolk  virginia for million  for a gain on the sale of approximately  the proceeds from the sale were used to pay down our line of credit 
industry classifications gladstone management corporation  or our adviser  seeks to diversify our portfolio to avoid dependence on any one particular tenant  geographic location or tenant industry 
by diversifying our portfolio  our adviser intends to reduce the adverse effect on our portfolio of a single under performing investment or a downturn in any particular industry or geographic region 
our largest tenant at december  comprised approximately of our total rental income  and our largest concentration of properties was located in ohio  which accounted for approximately of our total rental income 
the table below reflects the breakdown of our total rental income by tenant industry classification for the year ended december  and  respectively december  december  percentage of percentage of industry classification rental income rental income rental income rental income automobile beverage  food tobacco buildings and real estate chemicals  plastics rubber containers  packaging glass diversified conglomerate manufacturing diversified conglomerate services electronics healthcare  education childcare home office furnishings insurance machinery oil gas personal non durable consumer products personal  food miscellaneous services printing publishing telecommunications our adviser and administrator our adviser is led by a management team which has extensive experience in our lines of business 
our adviser is controlled by david gladstone  our chairman and chief executive officer 
mr 
gladstone is also the chairman and chief executive officer of our adviser 
terry lee brubaker  our vice chairman  chief operating officer  secretary and director  is a member of the board of directors of our adviser and its vice chairman and chief operating officer 
george stelljes iii  our president  chief investment officer and director  is a member of the board of directors of our adviser and its president and chief investment officer 
gladstone administration  llc  or our administrator  employs our chief financial officer  chief compliance officer  internal counsel  treasurer and their respective staffs 
our adviser and administrator also provide investment advisory and administrative services to our affiliates  gladstone capital corporation and gladstone investment corporation  both publicly traded business development companies  as well as gladstone land corporation  a private agricultural real estate company 
with the exception of our chief financial officer  all of our executive officers serve as either directors or executive officers  or both  of gladstone capital corporation and gladstone investment corporation 
in the future  our adviser may provide investment advisory and administrative services to other funds  both public and private  of which it is the sponsor 
advisory and administration agreements we are externally managed pursuant to contractual arrangements with our adviser and our administrator  under which our adviser and administrator have directly employed all of our personnel and paid their payroll  benefits  and general expenses directly 
on january   we entered into an advisory agreement with our adviser  which we refer to as the advisory agreement  and an administration agreement with our administrator  which we refer to as the administration agreement 
under the terms of the advisory agreement  we are responsible for all expenses incurred for our direct benefit 
examples of these expenses include legal  accounting  interest on short term debt and mortgages  tax preparation  directors and officers insurance  stock transfer services  stockholder related fees  consulting and related fees 
in addition  we are also responsible for all fees charged by third parties that are directly related to our business  which may include real estate brokerage fees  mortgage placement fees  lease up fees and transaction structuring fees although we may be able to pass some or all of such fees on to our tenants and borrowers 
during the years ended december   and  none of these expenses were incurred by us directly 
the actual amount of such fees that we incur in the future will depend largely upon the aggregate costs of the properties we acquire  the aggregate amount of mortgage loans we make and the extent to which we are able to shift the burden of such fees to our tenants and borrowers 
accordingly  the amount of these fees that we will pay in the future is not determinable at this time 
management services and fees under the advisory agreement the advisory agreement provides for an annual base management fee equal to of our total stockholders equity  less the recorded value of any preferred stock  and an incentive fee based on funds from operations  or ffo 
our adviser does not charge acquisition or disposition fees when we acquire or dispose of properties as is common in other reits 
furthermore  there are no fees charged when our adviser secures long or short term credit or arranges mortgage loans on our properties 
for purposes of calculating the incentive fee  ffo includes any realized capital gains and capital losses  less any distributions paid on preferred stock  but ffo does not include any unrealized capital gains or losses 
the incentive fee would reward our adviser if our quarterly ffo  before giving effect to any incentive fee  or pre incentive fee ffo  exceeds  or the hurdle rate  of total stockholders equity  less the recorded value of any preferred stock 
we pay our adviser an incentive fee with respect to our pre incentive fee ffo in each calendar quarter as follows no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre incentive fee ffo does not exceed the hurdle rate of annualized  of the amount of the pre incentive fee ffo that exceeds the hurdle rate  but is less than in any calendar quarter annualized  and of the amount of our pre incentive fee ffo that exceeds in any calendar quarter annualized 
quarterly incentive fee based on ffo pre incentive fee ffo expressed as a percentage of total common stockholders equity graphic percentage of pre incentive fee ffo allocated to incentive fee the incentive fee may be reduced because of our line of credit covenant which limits distributions to our stockholders to of ffo 
in order to comply with this covenant  our board of directors accepted our adviser s offer to unconditionally  irrevocably and voluntarily waive on a quarterly basis a portion of the incentive fee for the years ended december   and  which allowed us to maintain the current level of distributions to our stockholders 
these waivers were applied through december  and any waived fees may not be recouped by our adviser in the future 
our adviser has indicated that it intends to continue to waive all or a portion of the incentive fee in order to support the current level of distributions to our stockholders  however  our adviser is not required to issue any waiver  in whole or in part 
administration agreement under the administration agreement  we pay separately for our allocable portion of our administrator s overhead expenses in performing its obligations including  but not limited to  rent for employees of our administrator  and our allocable portion of the salaries and benefits expenses of our chief financial officer  chief compliance officer  internal counsel  treasurer and their respective staffs 
our allocable portion of expenses is derived by multiplying our administrator s total expenses by the percentage of our total assets at the beginning of each quarter in comparison to the total assets of all companies managed by our adviser under similar agreements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to make judgments that are subjective in nature in order to make certain estimates and assumptions 
management relies on its experience  collects historical data and current market data  and analyzes this information in order to arrive at what it believes to be reasonable estimates 
under different conditions or assumptions  materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
in addition  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
a summary of all of our significant accounting policies is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
below is a summary of accounting polices involving estimates and assumptions that require complex  subjective or significant judgments in their application and that materially affect our results of operations 
allocation of purchase price when we acquire real estate  we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and liabilities  consisting of land  building  tenant improvements  long term debt and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  the value of in place leases  the value of unamortized lease origination costs  the value of tenant relationships and the value of capital lease obligations  based in each case on their fair values 
management s estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers eg  discounted cash flow analysis 
factors considered by management in its analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  management also includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  which primarily range from to months  depending on specific local market conditions 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases  including leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction 
management also considers the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement  among other factors 
a change in any of the assumptions above  which are very subjective  could have a material impact on our results of operations 
the allocation of the purchase price directly affects the following in our consolidated financial statements the amount of purchase price allocated to the various tangible and intangible assets on our balance sheet  the amounts allocated to the value of above market and below market lease values are amortized to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the amounts allocated to all other tangible and intangible assets are amortized to depreciation or amortization expense 
thus  changes in the purchase price allocation among our assets could have a material impact on our ffo  depending on the amounts allocated between land and other depreciable assets  which is used by many reit investors to evaluate our operating performance  and the period of time that tangible and intangible assets are depreciated over varies greatly and thus  changes in the amounts allocated to these assets will have a direct impact on our results of operations 
intangible assets are generally amortized over the respective life of the leases  which normally range from to years  we depreciate our buildings over years  and land is not depreciated 
these differences in timing could have a material impact on our results of operations 
asset impairment evaluation we periodically review the carrying value of each property to determine if circumstances that indicate impairment in the carrying value of the investment exist or that depreciation periods should be modified 
in determining if impairment exists  management considers such factors as our tenants payment history  the financial condition of our tenants  including calculating the current leverage ratios of tenants  the likelihood of lease renewal  business conditions in the industry in which our tenants operate and whether the carrying value of our real estate has decreased 
if any of the factors above support the possibility of impairment  we prepare a projection of the undiscounted future cash flows  without interest charges  of the specific property and determine if the carrying amount in such property is recoverable 
in preparing the projection of undiscounted future cash flows  we estimate the hold periods of the properties and cap rates using information we obtain from market comparability studies and other comparable sources 
if impairment is indicated  the carrying value of the property would be written down to its estimated fair value based on our best estimate of the property s discounted future cash flows using assumptions or market participants 
any material changes to the estimates and assumptions used in this analysis could have a significant impact on our results of operations  as the changes would impact our determination of whether impairment is deemed to have occurred and the amount of impairment loss we would recognize 
using the methodology discussed above and in light of the current economic conditions discussed above in overview business environment  we performed an impairment analysis of our entire portfolio at december  we concluded that none of our properties are currently impaired  and we will continue to monitor our portfolio for any indicators that may change our conclusion 
provision for loan losses our accounting policies require that we reflect in our financial statements an allowance for estimated credit losses with respect to mortgage loans we have made based upon our evaluation of known and inherent risks associated with our private lending assets 
management reflects provisions for loan losses based upon our assessment of general market conditions  our internal risk management policies and credit risk rating system  industry loss experience  our assessment of the likelihood of delinquencies or defaults  and the value of the collateral underlying our investments 
any material changes to the estimates and assumptions used in this analysis could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we did not make a loss allowance for our existing mortgage loan receivable as of december   as we believe the carrying value of the loan is fully collectible 
recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of all recently issued accounting pronouncements 
results of operations our weighted average yield on the portfolio as of december  was approximately 
the weighted average yield on our portfolio is calculated by taking the annualized straight line rents  reflected as rental income on our consolidated statements of operations  or mortgage interest payments  reflected as interest income from mortgage notes receivable on our consolidated statements of operations  of each acquisition or mortgage loan as a percentage of the acquisition or loan price  as applicable 
the weighted average yield does not take into account the interest expense incurred on the financings placed on our properties

tenant recovery revenue decreased slightly for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of a decrease in the insurance premiums on some of our properties in which the tenants reimburse us for insurance expense  partially offset by an increase in the reimbursement of ground lease payments from a tenant 
operating expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   as a result of the properties acquired during the year ended december  that were held for the full year in property operating expenses consist of franchise taxes  management fees  insurance  ground lease payments and overhead expenses paid on behalf of certain of our properties

due diligence expense primarily consists of legal fees and fees incurred for third party reports prepared during our due diligence work 
due diligence expenses decreased significantly for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily because of over million of fees incurred related to a large potential acquisition that did not close during however  with the adoption of accounting standards codification  or asc  business combinations  on january   discussed in detail in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which requires us to no longer capitalize due diligence costs into the price of the acquisition  we expect our due diligence expense to increase significantly once we begin to acquire properties again 
the base management fee decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   as a result of a decrease in total common stockholders equity  the main component of the calculation 
total common stockholders equity decreased because distributions to common stockholders for the year ended december  exceeded net income during the period by approximately million 
the calculation of the base management fee is described in detail above under advisory and administration agreements 
the incentive fee increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to the increase in pre incentive fee ffo as a result of our increased rental income discussed above  coupled with the decrease in total common stockholders equity 
in addition  the amount that was credited to the incentive fee during the year ended december  decreased  because of an increase in operating income and a decrease in operating expenses 
the calculation of the incentive fee is described in detail above under advisory and administration agreements 
the administration fee increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of an increase in our total assets in comparison to the total assets of all companies managed by our adviser under similar agreements  coupled with approximately  incurred by our administrator  which was directly allocable to us  for the implementation of real estate software 
the calculation of the administration fee is described in detail above under advisory and administration agreements 
professional fees  consisting primarily of legal and accounting fees  increased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of an increase in legal and other professional fees relating to ongoing lease renegotiations and reviews of our legal work with our existing tenants 
insurance expense consists of the premiums paid for directors and officers insurance  which is renewed annually each september 
insurance expense increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   because of an increase in the premiums for the periods from september through september and from september through september directors fees decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of one of the independent directors becoming an interested director in january  and thus not being paid an annual stipend during stockholder related expense decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of decreased costs associated with printing and filing our proxy materials 
asset retirement obligation expense increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   because of the increase in the accretion of the expense over the term of the lease including renewal periods 
general and administrative expenses remained flat for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of a decrease in the amount of travel for site visits to our properties  offset by an increase in dues and subscriptions 
other income and expense interest income from temporary investments decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily because of lower interest rates earned on our money market accounts  partially offset by interest received in from funds held on deposit for a prospective real estate acquisition  coupled with interest earned on amounts held in reserve accounts with our lenders 
interest income on employee loans decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this decrease was a result of loan payoffs by employees during and  coupled with other partial principal repayments over the periods 
other income decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily because we no longer receive management fees from our tenant in our burnsville  minnesota property 
interest expense increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this was primarily a result of long term financings  which closed during  that were held for the full period during discontinued operations income from discontinued operations primarily relates to the property we sold  which was located in norfolk  virginia  including a gain on the sale of the property of approximately  this is partially offset by continuing expenses related to the two canadian properties  which we sold in july the expenses for the two canadian properties relate to legal fees associated with the dissolution of the entities  which sold the properties 
net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily a result of increased interest expense from the increased number of properties which have long term financing partially offset by the gain on sale of our property in norfolk  virginia coupled with the growth of our portfolio of investments in the past year and the corresponding increase in our revenues and the other events described above

liquidity and capital resources future capital needs at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
we have access to our existing line of credit with an available borrowing capacity of million  and have obtained mortgages on of our properties 
as of december  we had investments in real properties for a net carrying value  including intangible assets  of approximately million and one mortgage loan receivable for million 
as discussed in overview business environment above  while there have been improvements in the economy  we continue to be impacted by weak economic conditions  which have affected our ability to obtain additional mortgages  as well as our ability to borrow funds and issue equity securities  our principal sources of external financing 
until economic conditions recover  we intend to fund our existing contractual obligations with our cash flows from operations and borrowing against our existing line of credit 
if economic conditions continue to improve  we are hopeful that we will be able to issue additional equity securities under our effective shelf registration statement  including pursuant to out open market sale agreement  and through a private offering of senior common stock 
if we are able to raise significant equity  we would intend to use the proceeds to acquire additional properties  make mortgage loans  purchase shares of our preferred stock on the open market or pay down borrowings under our line of credit 
our existing shelf registration statement permits us to issue  through one or more transactions  up to an aggregate of million in securities consisting of common or preferred stock  all of which was available as of december  on november   we entered into an open market sale agreement with jefferies under which we may  from time to time  offer and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to million through or to jefferies for resale  based upon our instructions including any price  time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we may impose 
sales of our common stock through jefferies  if any  will be executed by means of ordinary brokers transactions on the nasdaq global select market or otherwise at market prices  in privately negotiated transactions  crosses or block transactions as may be agreed between us and jefferies  including a combination of any of these transactions 
we will pay jefferies a commission  or allow a discount  as the case may be  in each case equal to of the gross sales proceeds of any common stock sold through jefferies as agent under the open market sale agreement 
to date  we have not sold any shares of our common stock under the open market sale agreement and there is no guarantee that we will sell any common stock under the agreement in the future 
in addition  on november   we entered into a dealer manager agreement with halcyon who will act as our dealer manager in connection with a proposed continuous private offering of up to  shares of our newly designated senior common stock at per share 
this offering is only being made to accredited investors 
to date  we have not sold any shares of senior common stock under the dealer manager agreement and there can be no assurances that we will sell any senior common stock under the agreement in the future 
as banks begin lending again we intend to obtain mortgages on any additional acquired properties by collateralizing the mortgages with some or all of our real property  or by borrowing against our existing line of credit 
we may also use these funds for general corporate needs 
if we are unable to make any required debt payments on any borrowings  our lenders could foreclose on the properties collateralizing their loans  which could cause us to lose part or all of our investments in such properties 
we have million of balloon principal payments due under one of our long term mortgages in  however the mortgage has three annual extension options through  which we currently intend to exercise 
we have no other balloon principal payments due under any of our mortgages until we also need sufficient capital to fund our distributions to stockholders  pay the debt service costs on our existing long term mortgages  and fund our current operating costs 
we may require credits to our management fees  issued from our adviser  in order to meet these obligations  although our adviser is under no obligation to provide such credits  in whole or in part 
we routinely review our liquidity requirements  and we believe that our current cash flows from operations  coupled with our current availability on our line of credit  are sufficient to continue operations and pay distributions to our stockholders 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was approximately million  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of an increase in the amount of the net incentive fee paid to our adviser 
a majority of cash from operating activities is generated from the rental payments we receive from our tenants and the interest payments we receive from our borrower 
we utilize this cash to fund our property level operating expenses and use the excess cash primarily for debt and interest payments on our mortgage notes payable  interest payments on our line of credit  distributions to our stockholders  management fees to our adviser  and other entity level expenses 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was approximately  which primarily consisted of tenant improvements performed at our property located in maple heights  ohio and net payments to lenders for reserves and leasing commissions paid related to the extension of the lease for our property located in eatontown  new jersey  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of our property located in norfolk  virginia  as compared to net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  of approximately million  which primarily consisted of the purchase of six properties 
we have not purchased any properties since august because of the lack of access to capital as discussed in overview business environment above  which resulted in the significant decrease in the cash used in investing activities from to financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  which primarily consisted of repayment of our short term loan  repayments on our line of credit  principal repayments on mortgage notes payable and distributions paid to our stockholders  partially offset by borrowings on our line of credit 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  which primarily consisted of the proceeds from borrowings from mortgage notes payable and borrowings on our line of credit  partially offset by principal repayments on mortgage notes payable  repayments on our line of credit  distributions paid to our stockholders and payments for deferred financing costs 
mortgage notes payable as of december  we had fixed rate mortgage notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million  collateralized by a total of properties with terms at issuance ranging from years to years 
the weighted average interest rate on the mortgage notes payable as of december  was approximately line of credit we have a million senior revolving credit agreement  or credit agreement  with a syndicate of banks led by keybank national association  or keybank  which matures on december  on june   we amended our credit agreement to reduce our commitment from million to million  in exchange for modifications to certain terms under the credit agreement 
the definition of ffo was modified to exclude from the calculation of ffo acquisition related costs that are required to be expensed under asc in addition  the aggregate amount we can issue under the credit agreement as letters of credit was reduced from million to million 
the interest rate charged on the advances under the facility is based on libor  the prime rate or the federal funds rate  depending on market conditions  and adjusts periodically 
the unused portion of the line of credit is subject to a fee of per year 
our ability to access this funding source is subject to us continuing to meet customary lending requirements such as compliance with financial and operating covenants and meeting certain lending limits 
one such covenant requires us to limit distributions to our stockholders to of our ffo less those acquisition related costs that are required to be expensed under asc in addition  the maximum amount we may draw under this agreement is based on a percentage of the value of properties pledged as collateral to the banks  which must meet agreed upon eligibility standards 
keybank requested that we obtain updated appraisals for the properties pledged under the line of credit as borrowing base collateral in connection with the extension of the credit agreement 
as a result  the maximum amount we may draw under the credit agreement was reduced to approximately million 
furthermore  those properties that are pledged as collateral to the banks are pledged through a perfected first priority lien in the equity interest of the special purpose entity  or spe  that owns the property 
in addition  gladstone commercial limited partnership  a delaware limited partnership that owns the spes  or the operating partnership  is precluded from transferring the spes or unconsolidated affiliates to us 
if and when long term mortgages are arranged for these pledged properties  the banks will release the properties from the line of credit and reduce the availability under the line of credit by the advanced amount of the removed property 
conversely  as we purchase new properties meeting the eligibility standards  we may pledge these new properties to obtain additional advances under this agreement 
the availability under the line of credit will also be reduced by letters of credit used in the ordinary course of business 
we may use the advances under the line of credit for both general corporate purposes and the acquisition of new investments 
as of december   there was million outstanding under the line of credit at an interest rate of approximately  and approximately million outstanding under letters of credit at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
at december   the remaining borrowing capacity available under the line of credit was approximately million 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement as of december  short term loan on december   we entered into a million unsecured short term loan with keybank  which matured on december  we exercised our option to extend the term for an additional six months and  on march   we repaid in full the unsecured short term loan  using proceeds from borrowings under our line of credit 
the interest rate charged on the loan was based on libor  the prime rate or the federal funds rate  depending on market conditions  and adjusted periodically 
contractual obligations the following table reflects our significant contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years debt obligations interest on debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total debt obligations represent borrowings under our line of credit  which represents million of the debt obligation due in less than year  and mortgage notes payable that were outstanding as of december  the line of credit matures in december the million mortgage note issued in september matures in october  and we expect to exercise our options to extend the term through october interest on debt obligations includes estimated interest on our borrowings under our line of credit 
the balance and interest rate on our line of credit is variable  thus the amount of interest calculated for purposes of this table was based upon rates and balances as of december  capital lease obligations represent the obligation to purchase the land held under the ground lease on our property located in fridley  minnesota 
operating lease obligations represent the ground lease payments due on our tulsa  oklahoma property 
the lease expires in june off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
the primary risk that we believe we will be exposed to is interest rate risk 
we currently own one variable rate loan receivable  certain of our leases contain escalations based on market interest rates  and the interest rate on our existing line of credit is variable 
although we seek to mitigate this risk by structuring such provisions of our loans and leases to contain a minimum interest rate or escalation rate  as applicable  these features do not eliminate this risk 
we are also exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of the holding of our cash and cash equivalents in short term  interest bearing investments 
we have not entered into any derivative contracts to attempt to further manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net income for the years ended december  and  we have performed the following analysis  which assumes that our balance sheet remains constant and no further actions beyond a minimum interest rate or escalation rate are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity 
the following table summarizes the impact of a increase and decrease in the one month libor for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  increase in the one month libor rental interest income interest expense net decrease net income available to common stockholders as reported net decrease as percentage of net income available to common stockholders as reported decrease in the one month libor rental interest income interest expense net increase net income available to common stockholders net increase as percentage of net income available to common stockholders as of december   the fair value of our fixed rate debt outstanding was approximately million 
interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments 
if interest rates on our fixed rate debt instruments  using rates at december   had been one percentage point higher or lower  the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased or increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
in the future  we may be exposed to additional effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit or long term mortgage debt used to maintain liquidity and fund expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we will borrow primarily at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available and  in some cases  with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates 
we may also enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate the interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we will not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
in addition to changes in interest rates  the value of our real estate is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of lessees and borrowers  all of which may affect our ability to refinance debt if necessary
